## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for human extinction is extremely low, as there have been no known human extinction events in history. However, considering the expert opinion from the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference, which suggested a 19% probability by 2100, we should adjust this base rate slightly higher than zero but still keep it low due to the selection bias in the conference sample. A reasonable prior might be around 1% to 5%, reflecting both historical resilience and the expert opinion bias.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The historical resilience of humans against extinction-level events remains a strong factor. Humans have survived numerous global challenges, including pandemics and wars.
   - Differences: The current era is marked by rapid technological advancements, particularly in AI and biotechnology, which introduce new existential risks not present in historical base cases. Additionally, environmental degradation and geopolitical tensions present unique modern challenges.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - AI advancements (↑): The rapid development of AI increases existential risk concerns, as loss of control over AI systems could lead to catastrophic outcomes. This evidence increases the probability.
   - Climate agreements (↓): Recent progress in international climate agreements reduces the risk of environmental catastrophes, slightly decreasing the probability.
   - Geopolitical tensions (↑): Moderate tensions could escalate into conflicts with severe consequences, slightly increasing the probability.
   - Medical advancements (↓): Advances in medicine and pandemic response capabilities reduce the risk of extinction from diseases, slightly decreasing the probability.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds: Let's assume a prior probability of 3% (odds of 0.03 / 0.97).
   - Likelihood ratio: Considering the evidence, the net effect is a slight increase in risk due to technological advancements. Let's assume a likelihood ratio of 1.2.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio = (0.03 / 0.97) × 1.2 ≈ 0.0371 / 0.97
   - Posterior probability = 0.0371 / (0.0371 + 0.97) ≈ 3.68%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast might underestimate the potential for unforeseen technological or geopolitical developments that could drastically alter the risk landscape.
   - Alternative scenario: A breakthrough in AI safety or global cooperation could significantly reduce existential risks, suggesting a lower probability.
   - Adjustments: Given the uncertainties and potential for rapid change, a slight upward adjustment to account for tail risks is prudent.

6. **Final Forecast**
   - Considering the base rate, evidence, and red team thinking, a calibrated probability of human extinction by 2100 is around 4%.

Final: 4%

# Will humans go extinct before 2100?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For human extinction by 2100, I need to establish an appropriate base rate. This is challenging since human extinction has never occurred, so I'll consider several reference classes:

- **Species longevity**: The median mammalian species exists for about 1-2 million years. Homo sapiens have existed for roughly 300,000 years, suggesting a natural extinction probability of approximately 0.00005% per year.

- **Existential risk expert surveys**: The Oxford Global Catastrophic Risk Conference yielded a median estimate of 19%, but as noted, this likely suffers from selection bias.

- **More representative expert surveys**: The 2008 Future of Humanity Institute survey of experts yielded estimates ranging from 1-30% for human extinction by 2100, with a median closer to 5%.

- **Toby Ord's estimates**: In "The Precipice" (2020), Ord estimates approximately a 1/6 (≈17%) chance of existential catastrophe this century, with about 1/10 (10%) being extinction specifically.

Given these considerations, I'll use a base rate of 5% as my prior probability. This acknowledges both the natural resilience of humans as a species while accounting for the unprecedented technological risks we now face.

Prior probability (P(H)) = 5%
Prior odds = 0.05/0.95 = 1/19

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- Humans remain a highly adaptable species with global distribution
- We have survived previous existential threats (Cold War nuclear tensions, pandemics)
- International cooperation mechanisms exist for addressing global threats

**Differences from base case:**
- Unprecedented technological capabilities and risks (AI, biotechnology)
- Climate change acceleration beyond historical norms
- Greater global interconnectedness that could amplify cascading failures
- More powerful weapons systems than in previous eras

These differences suggest both increased risk factors (technology, climate) and increased resilience factors (cooperation, knowledge sharing).

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

Let's evaluate key pieces of evidence:

**Evidence 1: Accelerating AI development**
- P(E|H): If extinction occurs, rapid AI development without adequate safety measures is quite likely to be involved. P(E|H) ≈ 0.7
- P(E|~H): Even without extinction, we would expect to see AI advancement. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.5
- Likelihood ratio: 0.7/0.5 = 1.4
- This moderately increases the probability of extinction

**Evidence 2: Climate change mitigation efforts**
- P(E|H): If extinction occurs, climate mitigation efforts would likely have failed. P(E|H) ≈ 0.3
- P(E|~H): If extinction doesn't occur, we would expect to see some climate mitigation. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.3/0.7 = 0.43
- This decreases the probability of extinction

**Evidence 3: Nuclear weapons proliferation and geopolitical tensions**
- P(E|H): Extinction scenarios often involve nuclear conflict. P(E|H) ≈ 0.6
- P(E|~H): Even without extinction, we expect some nuclear tensions. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.5
- Likelihood ratio: 0.6/0.5 = 1.2
- This slightly increases the probability of extinction

**Evidence 4: Pandemic preparedness improvements post-COVID**
- P(E|H): If extinction occurs, pandemic preparedness would likely have been insufficient. P(E|H) ≈ 0.4
- P(E|~H): Without extinction, we expect improved pandemic responses. P(E|~H) ≈ 0.7
- Likelihood ratio: 0.4/0.7 = 0.57
- This decreases the probability of extinction

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 1/19 (≈0.053), I'll update sequentially:

**Update on AI development:**
- Posterior odds = 1/19 × 1.4 = 1.4/19 ≈ 0.074
- Posterior probability = 0.074/(1 + 0.074) ≈ 6.9%

**Update on climate mitigation:**
- Posterior odds = 0.074 × 0.43 ≈ 0.032
- Posterior probability = 0.032/(1 + 0.032) ≈ 3.1%

**Update on nuclear tensions:**
- Posterior odds = 0.032 × 1.2 ≈ 0.038
- Posterior probability = 0.038/(1 + 0.038) ≈ 3.7%

**Update on pandemic preparedness:**
- Posterior odds = 0.038 × 0.57 ≈ 0.022
- Posterior probability = 0.022/(1 + 0.022) ≈ 2.1%

After considering these key pieces of evidence, the posterior probability has moved from 5% to approximately 2.1%.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the risk from unknown unknowns or "black swan" events
- The evidence evaluation may be too optimistic about human adaptability
- I might be underweighting the compounding effects of multiple simultaneous crises
- The market estimate on Manifold (4.5%) is higher than my calculation

**Alternative scenarios:**
- AI development could accelerate much faster than anticipated, creating uncontrollable risks
- Bioterrorism or engineered pandemics could be more devastating than natural ones
- Environmental tipping points might be crossed sooner than expected
- Nuclear conflicts could escalate beyond regional containment

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my estimate upward somewhat. The market estimate of 4.5% suggests I may be underestimating the risk. The compounding nature of multiple simultaneous crises and potential for technological risks to manifest suddenly warrant an upward adjustment.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering the base rate, evidence, and potential blind spots, I believe the probability of human extinction before 2100 is approximately 3.5%. This reflects both the historical resilience of humans as a species and the unprecedented technological and environmental challenges we face.

Final: 3.5%

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use the historical maximum verified human lifespan as my base rate. Key reference points:

- Jeanne Calment (1875-1997): 122 years, 164 days (the oldest verified human ever)
- Kane Tanaka (1903-2022): 119 years, 107 days
- Maria Branyas (1907-present): Currently 115+ years old
- Lucile Randon (1904-2023): 118 years, 340 days

Looking at the last ~30 years of records, the oldest living person has typically been between 114-122 years old. The distribution appears to be right-skewed with a median around 117-118 years and a reasonable range of approximately 114-122 years.

Prior distribution:
- Median (P50): 118 years
- Range: Approximately 114-122 years

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to reference distribution:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively stable
- The verified maximum age has remained within a fairly narrow band for decades
- Verification processes for extreme age claims have become more rigorous

**Differences that matter:**
- We're forecasting 75 years into the future (2025 to 2100)
- Accelerating advances in medical technology, especially in areas directly targeting aging
- Increased research funding and focus on longevity science
- Potential for transformative technologies (gene therapy, cellular reprogramming, etc.)
- Larger global population means more potential outliers
- Better record-keeping and verification systems globally

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Life expectancy has doubled since 1900, suggesting continued upward pressure
- Specific anti-aging interventions are now in clinical trials (likelihood ratio ~2:1 for higher values)
- Genetic research is identifying specific aging mechanisms that could be targeted (likelihood ratio ~1.5:1)
- Larger global population increases the statistical likelihood of extreme outliers
- Wealthy individuals are investing billions in longevity research (likelihood ratio ~1.3:1)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Maximum age has remained relatively stable despite rising average life expectancy
- Biological limits may be harder to overcome than average health improvements
- Verification challenges may have inflated some historical claims
- Complex systems like human aging may have inherent limits that technology cannot easily overcome

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered at 118 years with a range of 114-122 years, I'll update based on the evidence:

First update - Medical technology advances:
- Prior median: 118 years
- Likelihood ratio: ~2:1 favoring higher values
- Posterior shift: +4 years (to 122 years)
- Increased variance due to uncertainty about technological progress

Second update - Biological limits:
- Intermediate posterior median: 122 years
- Likelihood ratio: ~1:1.5 favoring lower values (biological constraints)
- Posterior adjustment: -2 years (to 120 years)

Third update - Population size effects:
- Intermediate posterior median: 120 years
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.3:1 favoring higher values
- Posterior adjustment: +1 year (to 121 years)

Final posterior median: 121 years
Expanded range: 115-130 years (reflecting increased uncertainty over the 75-year timeframe)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for transformative breakthroughs in aging science
- The 75-year timeframe is extremely long for technological forecasting
- I might be anchoring too strongly to historical precedent
- Societal collapse or major setbacks could reduce maximum lifespan

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Radical breakthrough scenario: Cellular reprogramming or similar technology extends maximum lifespan to 150+ years
- Conservative scenario: Biological limits prove stubborn, and maximum age remains around 122 years
- Catastrophic scenario: Global instability reduces healthcare quality, maximum age decreases to ~110 years

**Adjustments needed:**
- Widen the distribution to account for the long timeframe
- Increase the upper tail to account for potential breakthroughs
- Maintain a reasonable lower bound given established capabilities

## 6. Final Percentiles

After considering all evidence and potential scenarios across a 75-year forecast horizon:

P10: 116
P20: 119
P40: 123
P60: 127
P80: 133
P90: 140

## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
To forecast the number of new AI labs that will become leading labs within two years of their founding by 2030, we will follow a structured Bayesian reasoning approach.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

- **Option 1 (0 or 1 labs)**: Historically, very few AI labs achieve leading status quickly. Reference Class 1 suggests a base rate of 1–2 labs becoming leading within two years. Given the historical context, a prior of 20% seems reasonable for this option.
  
- **Option 2 (2 or 3 labs)**: This aligns with the upper end of Reference Class 1. Given the historical base rate and the current environment, a prior of 25% is appropriate.
  
- **Option 3 (4 or 5 labs)**: This is higher than historical trends but plausible given the current environment. Reference Class 2 suggests a 5% success rate for tech startups, but with increased investment and talent mobility, a prior of 30% is reasonable.
  
- **Option 4 (6 or 7 labs)**: This is less likely given historical data but possible with significant changes in the environment. A prior of 15% is reasonable.
  
- **Option 5 (8 or 9 labs)**: This is quite unlikely based on historical trends and current evidence. A prior of 7% is reasonable.
  
- **Option 6 (10 or more labs)**: This is the least likely scenario given historical data and current evidence. A prior of 3% is reasonable.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case

- **Similarities**: The base rate scenario involves AI labs achieving leading status, which is consistent with the question.
  
- **Differences**: The current environment has increased funding, talent mobility, and rapid technological advancements, which could lead to more labs achieving leading status than historical trends suggest.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

- **Investment Influx**: Increases the likelihood of more labs becoming leaders. This evidence supports higher probabilities for options 3 and 4.
  
- **Talent Mobility**: Also increases the likelihood of more labs becoming leaders, supporting options 3 and 4.
  
- **Technological Breakthroughs**: Increases the likelihood of more labs becoming leaders, supporting options 3 and 4.
  
- **Regulatory Environment**: Slightly decreases the likelihood, but not significantly enough to outweigh other factors.
  
- **Market Demand**: Increases the likelihood of more labs becoming leaders, supporting options 3 and 4.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

- **Option 3 (4 or 5 labs)**: Given the strong evidence of increased investment, talent mobility, and technological breakthroughs, the prior of 30% should be updated upwards. Posterior probability: 40%.
  
- **Option 4 (6 or 7 labs)**: The same evidence supports an increase, but less strongly. Posterior probability: 20%.
  
- **Other Options**: The evidence does not strongly support significant increases for other options. Adjustments are minor.

### 5. Red Team Thinking

- **Overconfidence Check**: Consider the possibility of unforeseen regulatory changes or market shifts that could impact the number of leading labs.
  
- **Alternative Scenarios**: A scenario where regulatory changes significantly slow down new lab formation could increase the probability of options 1 and 2.
  
- **Adjustments**: Slightly increase the probability for options 1 and 2 to account for these risks.

### 6. Final Normalization

Ensure probabilities sum to approximately 100%:

- Option 1: 15%
- Option 2: 20%
- Option 3: 40%
- Option 4: 20%
- Option 5: 3%
- Option 6: 2%

### 7. Output Format

Option_1: 15%  
Option_2: 20%  
Option_3: 40%  
Option_4: 20%  
Option_5: 3%  
Option_6: 2%

# Analysis of New Leading AI Labs by 2030

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

Let me establish base rates for each option by examining historical patterns of AI labs becoming leaders quickly:

- Since ChatGPT's release in late 2022, we've seen Mistral AI (founded 2023) rise to become a leading lab within about a year.
- Anthropic (founded 2021) became a leading lab within about 1-2 years.
- Cohere (founded 2019) took somewhat longer to reach leading status.

Looking at the research report's reference class: "AI labs founded in the last decade; base rate: ~1–2 labs become leading within 2 years."

Given we have about 5 years until 2030, and considering the current pace of AI development, I'll set these initial priors:

- 0 or 1: 15% (conservative estimate based on historical precedent)
- 2 or 3: 30% (aligns with research report's base rate)
- 4 or 5: 25% (slightly higher than historical rate)
- 6 or 7: 15% (less likely but plausible)
- 8 or 9: 10% (increasingly unlikely)
- 10 or more: 5% (tail probability)

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate scenario:**
- Established players (OpenAI, Google DeepMind, etc.) have significant advantages in talent, compute, and data.
- Technical barriers to entry remain high.

**Differences from base rate scenario:**
- Increased investment in AI (the research notes "investment influx" as a large positive driver).
- Higher talent mobility with examples like Anthropic and Udio forming from existing labs.
- Faster technological development cycles than historical trends.
- Greater public and regulatory attention to AI.
- Potential for key figures like Demis Hassabis to start new ventures.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Increased investment in AI**
- P(E|H="4 or 5") is high - this level of investment would support several new leading labs.
- P(E|H="0 or 1") is low - such investment would likely yield more than 1 new leading lab.
- Likelihood ratio favors higher numbers (4-5 and above).

**Evidence 2: Talent mobility from established labs**
- P(E|H="2 or 3") or higher is strong - we're already seeing this pattern with Anthropic, Udio, etc.
- P(E|H="0 or 1") is low - continued talent mobility suggests more new labs will form.
- Likelihood ratio favors mid-range options (2-3, 4-5).

**Evidence 3: Regulatory environment**
- P(E|H="8 or 9" or "10+") is lower - increased regulation could limit proliferation of many new labs.
- P(E|H="2 or 3" or "4 or 5") is higher - some regulation may actually help a moderate number of well-positioned new entrants.
- Likelihood ratio favors middle options over extreme high counts.

**Evidence 4: Mistral AI's rapid rise**
- P(E|H="0 or 1") is very low - we've already seen one example in just the past year.
- P(E|H="4 or 5") is high - this demonstrates the feasibility of quick ascension.
- Likelihood ratio strongly disfavors the lowest option.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior)

Let's update on Evidence 4 (Mistral AI's rapid rise) for the "0 or 1" option:
- Prior probability: 15%
- Prior odds: 15/85 = 0.176
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.3 (significantly less likely to see Mistral's rise if only 0-1 new leaders will emerge)
- Posterior odds: 0.176 × 0.3 = 0.053
- Posterior probability: 0.053/(1+0.053) ≈ 5%

For the "4 or 5" option:
- Prior probability: 25%
- Prior odds: 25/75 = 0.333
- Likelihood ratio: ~2.0 (Mistral's rise is about twice as likely under this hypothesis)
- Posterior odds: 0.333 × 2.0 = 0.666
- Posterior probability: 0.666/(1+0.666) ≈ 40%

Updating on the other evidence:
- Investment influx and talent mobility increase probabilities for mid-range options (2-3, 4-5).
- Regulatory concerns slightly decrease probabilities for higher options (8-9, 10+).
- Technological pace increases probabilities across the board but especially for mid-range options.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the ease of becoming a "leading lab" - the ELO rating system has high standards.
- I might be underestimating consolidation pressures - big tech could acquire promising startups.
- The definition of "leading" could change as the field evolves.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative is that we see only 2-3 new leading labs because:
- Existing leaders (OpenAI, Google, etc.) might maintain their advantage through superior resources.
- Regulatory barriers could increase significantly.
- The "winner-takes-most" dynamic in AI might intensify.

**Rebuttal:**
However, the evidence of Mistral's rapid rise and the formation of Anthropic and Udio suggests that new entrants can quickly become competitive, especially with the right talent and funding.

## 6. Final Normalization

After all updates and considerations, my revised probabilities are:
- 0 or 1: 5% (significantly reduced due to Mistral example and investment trends)
- 2 or 3: 25% (reduced slightly as evidence favors higher counts)
- 4 or 5: 40% (increased significantly based on evidence)
- 6 or 7: 20% (increased slightly)
- 8 or 9: 7% (reduced due to regulatory concerns)
- 10 or more: 3% (reduced due to practical limitations)

## 7. Output Format

0 or 1: 5%
2 or 3: 25%
4 or 5: 40%
6 or 7: 20%
8 or 9: 7%
10 or more: 3%
(sum 100%)

### Reference class & base rates
- **Historical suspensions of habeas corpus in the U.S.**: Rare, with notable instances during the Civil War and WWII. Base rate: extremely low.
- **Executive actions on civil liberties during perceived crises**: Moderate frequency, but full suspension is rare.
- **Use of emergency powers for immigration enforcement**: More common, but not typically involving habeas corpus suspension.

### Recent developments (timeline bullets)
- [2025-05-15] ↑ — Stephen Miller's statement on considering habeas corpus suspension signals potential policy direction.
- [2025-06-20] ↓ — Supreme Court blocks use of Alien Enemies Act, reinforcing judicial checks on executive power.

### Mechanisms & drivers (causal levers)
- **Political climate**: Moderate — Rising nationalism and immigration concerns could drive policy.
- **Judicial oversight**: Large — Strong judicial checks could prevent suspension.
- **Public opinion**: Moderate — Public backlash against civil liberties erosion could deter action.
- **International relations**: Small — Global criticism may influence decision-making.
- **Internal administration dynamics**: Moderate — Key advisors' influence could sway decisions.

### Differences vs. the base rate (what’s unusual now)
- **Current administration's aggressive stance on immigration** contrasts with historical contexts of war.
- **Judicial resistance** is more pronounced now than in past suspensions.
- **Public and media scrutiny** is heightened, potentially influencing policy decisions.
- **Technological surveillance capabilities** offer alternative enforcement methods without suspending habeas corpus.

### Bayesian update sketch (for the statistician)
- **Prior**: Extremely low probability based on historical rarity; equivalent n = 5.
- **Evidence mapping**:
  - ↑ Miller's statement (small)
  - ↓ Supreme Court decision (large)
  - ↓ Strong judicial oversight (moderate)
  - ↓ Public opinion against civil liberties erosion (moderate)
- **Net effect**: Posterior should move slightly down due to strong judicial and public constraints.

### Indicators to watch (leading signals; next weeks/months)
- **UP indicators**:
  - Increased rhetoric from administration on national security threats.
  - Legislative support for emergency powers.
  - High-profile incidents involving immigration enforcement.
- **DOWN indicators**:
  - Continued judicial rulings against executive overreach.
  - Public protests or backlash against civil liberties erosion.
  - Statements from key administration figures opposing suspension.

### Caveats & pitfalls
- **Uncertainty in political dynamics**: Shifts in administration priorities could alter probabilities.
- **Data gaps**: Limited transparency on internal deliberations.
- **Deception risks**: Potential for misleading public statements.
- **Regime changes**: Changes in administration could reset policy directions.
- **Definitional gotchas**: Ambiguities in what constitutes a "suspension" could affect resolution.

Final Research Summary: The probability of the Trump administration suspending habeas corpus before January 20, 2029, remains low due to strong judicial oversight and public resistance, despite some rhetoric suggesting consideration.

## MODEL REASONING (RAW)
### OpenRouter-Default [openai/gpt-4o]
```
1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The historical base rate for the suspension of habeas corpus in the U.S. is extremely low, with notable instances only during the Civil War and WWII. Given the rarity of such actions, a very low prior probability is appropriate. I will start with a base rate of 1% (0.01 probability) for the suspension of habeas corpus.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current administration's aggressive stance on immigration and national security concerns could be seen as analogous to past crises that led to suspensions.
   - Differences: The current situation lacks the existential threats present during past suspensions (e.g., civil war, world war). Additionally, there is strong judicial oversight and public scrutiny, which were less pronounced in historical cases.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - **Stephen Miller's statement**: This suggests a potential policy direction, slightly increasing the likelihood of suspension. Likelihood ratio > 1.
   - **Supreme Court decision**: This reinforces judicial checks, significantly decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Judicial oversight**: Strong judicial checks are a major deterrent, decreasing the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.
   - **Public opinion**: Public resistance to civil liberties erosion also decreases the likelihood. Likelihood ratio < 1.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)**
   - Prior odds = 0.01 / 0.99 ≈ 0.0101
   - Likelihood ratio (combined): Considering the strong judicial and public constraints, the net likelihood ratio is significantly less than 1.
   - Posterior odds = Prior odds × Likelihood ratio ≈ 0.0101 × 0.5 (approximate combined effect) = 0.00505
   - Posterior probability = 0.00505 / (1 + 0.00505) ≈ 0.0050 or 0.5%

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The low probability might underestimate the potential for unexpected political shifts or crises.
   - Alternative scenario: A major national security incident could shift public and judicial opinion, increasing the likelihood.
   - Rebuttal: The current legal and public environment strongly favors maintaining habeas corpus rights.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slight increase to account for unforeseen political dynamics, but maintain a low probability.

5. **Final Forecast**
   - Given the strong judicial oversight, public resistance, and historical rarity, the probability remains low. However, acknowledging potential political shifts, I will adjust slightly upward.

# Will the Trump administration announce a suspension of habeas corpus before January 20, 2029?

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this question, I need to establish a prior probability based on historical precedents of habeas corpus suspension in the United States.

- Habeas corpus has been suspended only a few times in U.S. history:
  - During the Civil War by President Lincoln (1861-1865)
  - During Reconstruction in certain counties in South Carolina (1871)
  - In the Philippines during the Philippine-American War (1905)
  - In Hawaii after Pearl Harbor during WWII (1941)

Given that there have been approximately 4 instances of habeas corpus suspension across nearly 250 years of U.S. history, and these occurred during extraordinary circumstances (civil war, world war), the base rate is extremely low.

Additionally, no suspension has occurred in the mainland United States since the Civil War/Reconstruction era (over 150 years).

**Prior probability**: 1% (1 in 100)

This reflects the historical rarity of such an extreme measure, particularly in modern American governance.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base case:**
- The Trump administration has shown willingness to test constitutional boundaries
- There is rhetoric about immigration as an "invasion," similar to how past suspensions were justified by security threats
- The administration has already attempted to use wartime powers (Alien Enemies Act) for immigration enforcement

**Differences from base case:**
- Unlike during the Civil War or WWII, there is no active military conflict on U.S. soil
- Modern judicial review is more robust than during previous suspensions
- Constitutional norms against executive overreach have strengthened
- Digital surveillance and enforcement technologies provide alternatives to suspension
- The Supreme Court has already blocked related attempts to circumvent due process

These differences significantly reduce the likelihood compared to historical cases where suspension occurred.

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence 1: Stephen Miller's statement about "actively looking at" suspension**
- P(E|H): If suspension will occur, such statements would be very likely (~90%)
- P(E|~H): Even if suspension won't occur, such rhetoric could still be used for political signaling (~30%)
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1 in favor of suspension
- This evidence moderately increases the probability

**Evidence 2: Supreme Court blocking the Alien Enemies Act application**
- P(E|H): If suspension will occur, we would expect some judicial resistance (~70%)
- P(E|~H): If suspension won't occur, such judicial checks would be very likely (~95%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.74:1 against suspension
- This evidence decreases the probability

**Evidence 3: Constitutional and institutional constraints**
- P(E|H): If suspension will occur, we would expect weakened institutional constraints (~20%)
- P(E|~H): If suspension won't occur, strong institutional constraints would be likely (~80%)
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25:1 against suspension
- This evidence significantly decreases the probability

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Probability)

Starting with prior odds of 1:99 (1% probability)

**Update on Evidence 1 (Miller's statement):**
- Prior odds: 1:99
- Likelihood ratio: 3:1
- Posterior odds: 3:99 ≈ 1:33
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+33) ≈ 3%

**Update on Evidence 2 (Supreme Court blocking):**
- Prior odds: 1:33
- Likelihood ratio: 0.74:1
- Posterior odds: 0.74:33 ≈ 1:45
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+45) ≈ 2.2%

**Update on Evidence 3 (Constitutional constraints):**
- Prior odds: 1:45
- Likelihood ratio: 0.25:1
- Posterior odds: 0.25:45 ≈ 1:180
- Posterior probability: 1/(1+180) ≈ 0.55%

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the willingness to take extreme measures in a second Trump term
- The composition of the Supreme Court could change, potentially weakening judicial checks
- A genuine security crisis could emerge that would make suspension more justifiable
- The definition of "suspension" might be interpreted differently (partial or regional suspension)

**Alternative scenarios:**
- A major terrorist attack or border crisis could dramatically change the calculus
- Legal workarounds might be found that achieve similar effects without formal suspension
- Congressional support for emergency measures could increase after midterm elections

**Adjustments:**
Given these considerations, I should adjust my probability upward somewhat. The potential for unprecedented actions in a second Trump term, combined with possible changes in court composition and security situations, warrants caution against being too confident in institutional guardrails.

## 6. Final Forecast

After considering historical precedent, current evidence, and potential blind spots, I adjust my final probability to 2%. This reflects the extreme rarity of habeas corpus suspension in U.S. history, strong institutional constraints, and judicial opposition, while acknowledging the uncertainty of future political developments.

Final: 2%
