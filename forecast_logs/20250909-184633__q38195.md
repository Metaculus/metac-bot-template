To forecast the number of major US labor strikes with generative AI as one of their main reasons starting in 2029, we will follow the outlined steps:

1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for major US labor strikes annually is around 20-30. However, strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent, with only a few notable cases in recent years. Given the recent trend of 2-3 major strikes in the entertainment/media sector due to AI, we will use this as our base rate for AI-related strikes.
   - Mean/Median: 2.5 strikes, Variance: 1 (reflecting some uncertainty in the exact number).

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The entertainment/media sector continues to be heavily impacted by AI, similar to recent years.
   - Differences: The pace of AI development and its central role in labor disputes is more pronounced now, suggesting a potential increase in strike activity.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Increased AI adoption in media (Large ↑): This significantly raises the likelihood of strikes.
   - Union leadership focusing on AI issues (Moderate ↑): This moderately increases the likelihood.
   - Public concern over AI job impacts (Small ↑): This slightly increases the likelihood.
   - Potential regulatory interventions (Small ↓): This slightly decreases the likelihood.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: 2-3 strikes (mean 2.5).
   - Likelihood adjustments: The evidence suggests a moderate increase in the likelihood of strikes.
   - Posterior mean: Adjusting upwards from the prior mean of 2.5 to around 3.5 strikes, reflecting the increased likelihood due to AI adoption and union focus.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast could be overconfident if AI adoption slows or if effective regulations are implemented.
   - Tail risks: A rapid acceleration in AI adoption or a major economic downturn could lead to more strikes.
   - Alternative forecast: A scenario with effective regulation and economic stability might result in fewer strikes, around 2.
   - Adjustments: Consider a slightly wider distribution to account for these uncertainties.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - Based on the updated posterior distribution and considering the uncertainties, the percentiles are as follows:

P10: 2  
P20: 2.5  
P40: 3  
P60: 3.5  
P80: 4  
P90: 5

# Forecasting Major US Labor Strikes with Generative AI as a Main Reason in 2029

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For this forecast, I'll use multiple reference classes to establish a prior:

1. **Recent AI-related strikes**: From the background, we've seen 3 major strikes with AI as a primary concern from 2023-2025 (Writers Guild, SAG-AFTRA actors, and SAG-AFTRA video game performers). This suggests approximately 1-1.5 AI-related strikes per year in recent history.

2. **Major US labor strikes overall**: The research report indicates 20-30 major labor strikes annually in the US historically.

3. **Technology-driven strikes**: The report notes that strikes specifically citing technology as a primary concern are less frequent.

Given these reference classes, I'll establish a prior centered around 2-3 AI-related strikes for 2029, with significant uncertainty. This aligns with the research report's prior suggestion and extrapolates from the recent trend of AI-specific labor actions.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Labor unions continue to exist and use strikes as a negotiation tool
- AI technology continues to develop and impact various industries
- Entertainment/media sectors remain particularly vulnerable to AI disruption

**Differences from base rate:**
- By 2029, AI technology will be significantly more advanced than in 2023-2025
- AI adoption will likely be more widespread across industries beyond entertainment
- Unions will have had several years to develop specific strategies around AI concerns
- Initial AI-related strikes may have established precedents for addressing these issues
- The novelty of AI as a strike reason may have diminished

These differences suggest a potential for both higher numbers of strikes (due to wider AI adoption) and lower numbers (due to established precedents reducing the need for strikes).

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence supporting higher numbers:**
- Increasing AI adoption in media (large impact): The research report indicates this is a large driver, suggesting ~2x likelihood of higher values.
- Union leadership focusing on AI issues (moderate impact): This suggests ~1.5x likelihood of higher values.
- Public concern over AI job impacts (small impact): This suggests ~1.2x likelihood of higher values.
- OpenAI's film project (moderate impact): Indicates AI's growing role in creative industries, suggesting ~1.3x likelihood of higher values.

**Evidence supporting lower numbers:**
- Potential regulatory interventions (small impact): This suggests ~0.9x likelihood of higher values.
- Established precedents from earlier strikes may reduce the need for new strikes (moderate impact): This suggests ~0.7x likelihood of higher values.
- By 2029, some industries may have already adapted to AI integration (moderate impact): This suggests ~0.8x likelihood of higher values.

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with a prior centered at 2-3 strikes with a wide distribution (equivalent n = 5 as suggested in the report):

**First update - AI adoption in media (large impact):**
- Prior: 2-3 strikes
- Likelihood ratio: ~2x for higher values
- Posterior: Shifts upward to ~3-5 strikes

**Second update - Established precedents (moderate impact):**
- Prior: 3-5 strikes
- Likelihood ratio: ~0.7x for higher values
- Posterior: Adjusts downward to ~2.5-4 strikes

**Third update - Wider industry adoption beyond entertainment:**
- Prior: 2.5-4 strikes
- Likelihood ratio: ~1.4x for higher values
- Posterior: Shifts upward to ~3-5 strikes

The posterior distribution is now centered around 3-5 strikes, with a wider spread than the prior to account for the uncertainty in how AI will develop and be adopted by 2029.

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be overestimating the continued relevance of AI as a strike issue by 2029. If AI becomes normalized in workplaces, it might cease to be a primary concern.
- I might be underestimating the potential for AI to disrupt entirely new industries by 2029, leading to more strikes in sectors not currently considering AI threats.
- The definition of "generative AI" might evolve significantly by 2029, making it difficult to classify strikes.

**Alternative forecast:**
A plausible alternative forecast would center around 0-1 strikes, arguing that by 2029, most industries will have established clear agreements about AI use, reducing the need for strikes. Additionally, workers might focus on other emerging technologies or economic issues by then.

**Rebuttal to alternative:**
While some industries may establish agreements, the pace of AI development suggests that new capabilities will continue to emerge, potentially threatening jobs in new ways that weren't anticipated in earlier agreements.

**Tail risks:**
- Upper tail: A breakthrough in AI capabilities around 2028-2029 could trigger a wave of strikes across multiple industries simultaneously.
- Lower tail: Effective regulation or industry-wide agreements could preemptively address AI concerns, reducing strikes to zero.

Given these considerations, I'll widen my distribution slightly and shift it to account for these tail risks.

## Gemini [gemini-2.5-pro]

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the number of major US labor strikes starting in 2029 with generative AI as a main reason. A "major strike" is defined by the BLS as involving 1,000+ workers.

The most relevant reference class is the recent history of such strikes. Since mid-2023, there have been three notable strikes fitting this description (WGA, SAG-AFTRA actors, SAG-AFTRA video games). This establishes a recent base rate of approximately 1.5 strikes per year.

However, the forecast is for 2029, four years in the future. Given the rapid development and adoption of AI, a static base rate is insufficient. The trend is clearly upward. Therefore, I will establish a prior distribution that starts with the recent historical rate but projects it forward with significant uncertainty. I'll model my prior as a distribution centered around 3 strikes for 2029, acknowledging that the rate is likely to grow. This prior has a wide spread, for instance, with a 10th percentile around 1 and a 90th percentile around 5, reflecting the high uncertainty of projecting a new trend.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The situation in 2029 will differ from the 2023-2025 base period in several key ways, all of which suggest a higher number of strikes:
- **Broader Adoption**: In 2023-2024, the impact was concentrated in the media/entertainment sector. By 2029, generative AI tools will be more mature and integrated into a wider range of "white-collar" industries like software development, journalism, education, and customer support, creating new potential fronts for labor disputes.
- **Increased Union Precedent**: The successful negotiations by the WGA and SAG-AFTRA have created a playbook and a precedent. Other unions will be more aware of the threat and more prepared to act, potentially making strikes a more common tool to force negotiations on AI.
- **Pace of Change**: The rate of AI improvement is exceptionally fast. The capabilities of AI in 2029 will likely be far beyond those of 2025, making the threat to labor more tangible and urgent, thus increasing the likelihood of conflict.

These differences strongly suggest that the distribution should be shifted upwards from the simple 2023-2025 base rate.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the evidence from the research report to update my prior.
- **AI Adoption in Media (Large ↑)**: The report highlights OpenAI's film project and the general trend of increasing AI use. This is a strong piece of evidence that the core driver of these strikes is accelerating, not plateauing. This makes higher outcomes (e.g., >4 strikes) much more likely than lower outcomes.
- **Union Leadership & Public Sentiment (Moderate ↑)**: The sustained focus of unions on AI and growing public concern create a supportive environment for labor action. This evidence reinforces the upward trend, making it more probable that union grievances will translate into actual strikes.
- **Spread to New Sectors (Implicit, Large ↑)**: While the report focuses on media, the nature of generative AI implies its spread to other large, unionized sectors (e.g., teachers, government workers, healthcare). The potential for even one or two major strikes in these new sectors significantly shifts the distribution upwards. This is a crucial factor not fully captured by the initial media-focused base rate.
- **Legal/Policy Frameworks (Small ↓)**: The report notes that new regulations could mitigate the need for strikes. This is a plausible moderating factor. However, given the typical pace of US regulation on new technology, the impact by 2029 is likely to be small and uncertain. This provides a slight downward pressure, mainly capping the most extreme tail risks.

Overall, the evidence overwhelmingly points towards a higher number of strikes than the prior suggested. The combination of accelerating technology, broadening impact across sectors, and established union precedents is a powerful cocktail for labor unrest.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
- **Prior**: Centered at 3 strikes, range [1, 5].
- **Likelihoods**: The evidence strongly favors a world with more AI-related strikes. The likelihood of observing accelerating AI adoption and spread to new sectors is much higher if the true rate of strikes in 2029 is, for example, 5, than if it is 2.
- **Posterior**: I will update my prior distribution significantly to the right.
    - The median of the distribution shifts from 3 to 4 or 5.
    - The variance increases to reflect the new uncertainty from different sectors. The outcome is no longer just about "how many more media strikes?" but "which new sectors will have their first AI strike?".
    - The distribution becomes more right-skewed. There is a plausible, albeit not certain, scenario of a "strike wave" across multiple industries, leading to a high number (7+). The downside is more constrained; it's very unlikely to be zero or one, given the momentum.

My posterior distribution is now centered around a median of 4.5, with a significant tail risk of a higher number of strikes.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must challenge my forecast. What could cause a much lower number of strikes?
1.  **Successful Preemption**: The 2023 strikes were so effective they created a clear template. Unions and companies in other sectors might successfully negotiate contracts with AI protections *without* needing to strike, using the 2023 outcomes as a model.
2.  **AI Adoption Slows**: The economic or practical viability of replacing/augmenting workers with AI might prove more difficult than anticipated, slowing down deployment and reducing the immediate threat.
3.  **Effective Regulation**: A new political administration could pass surprisingly robust pro-labor AI regulations, addressing key union demands and making strikes less necessary.

While these scenarios are plausible, they seem less likely than the main forecast. Preemption will not work in all cases; the economic incentives for companies to deploy AI are immense; and swift, effective federal regulation is historically rare in the US. The primary effect of this red teaming is to reinforce the idea that the lower tail of the distribution should not be dismissed. A count of 2 or 3 strikes is still a very possible outcome. However, the upside risk of a strike wave across newly affected industries feels more probable than these downside scenarios. I will maintain a right-skewed distribution but ensure the P10 and P20 values reflect these possibilities.

### 6. Final Percentiles
My final forecast reflects a distribution with a median between 4 and 5, a right skew, and significant uncertainty. The low end accounts for scenarios where the trend slows or negotiations preempt strikes, while the high end accounts for a potential wave of strikes as AI spreads to new industries.
