```text
1. **Base Rate (Prior) Selection**
   - The base rate for the age of the oldest living person is informed by historical data on supercentenarians. As of 2023, the oldest verified age is 122 years (Jeanne Calment). The base rate distribution is centered around this historical maximum, with a mean/median of approximately 115 years and a variance reflecting the rarity of ages beyond 115.

2. **Comparison to Base Case**
   - Similarities: The current situation reflects historical trends where very few individuals reach ages beyond 115. The base rate is appropriate given the rarity of supercentenarians.
   - Differences: Advances in medical technology and increased focus on longevity research could potentially extend maximum ages, but the slowing gains in life expectancy suggest limited impact. These differences suggest a slight upward shift in the distribution but not a significant one.

3. **Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)**
   - Slowing life expectancy gains (↓ Large): Strong evidence that limits the potential for significant increases in maximum age.
   - Potential medical breakthroughs (↑ Moderate): Could increase the likelihood of higher ages, but the impact is uncertain.
   - Increased focus on longevity research (↑ Small): May contribute to higher ages but is less impactful than medical breakthroughs.
   - Current life expectancy trends (↓ Small): Reinforces the slowing gains, slightly reducing the likelihood of higher ages.

4. **Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)**
   - Prior: Mean of 115 years, reflecting historical maximums.
   - Likelihood: Slowing gains strongly suggest a downward adjustment, while potential breakthroughs provide a moderate upward push.
   - Posterior: The mean shifts slightly downward due to the strong evidence of slowing gains, with a slight increase in variance to account for potential breakthroughs.

5. **Red Team Thinking**
   - Overconfidence risk: The forecast may underestimate the potential for breakthroughs in geroscience.
   - Tail risks: Consider the possibility of a breakthrough that significantly extends lifespan, though this remains speculative.
   - Alternative forecast: A more optimistic scenario could place the mean around 120 years, but this requires substantial evidence of breakthroughs.
   - Adjustments: Given the uncertainty, the percentiles should reflect a wider range to account for potential breakthroughs.

6. **Final Percentiles**
   - The percentiles are adjusted to reflect the slight downward shift in the mean and increased variance due to potential breakthroughs.

# Forecasting the Age of the Oldest Living Person in 2100

## 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection

For my prior, I'll use the historical record of maximum human lifespan:

- The oldest verified human ever was Jeanne Calment who died at 122 years and 164 days (1997)
- The current oldest living person is Maria Branyas at 115 years old (2023)
- Over the past century, the record for oldest living person has typically ranged between 115-122 years

The distribution of this base rate appears to have:
- Mean/median: approximately 117-118 years
- Variance: relatively narrow, with most records falling within 5 years of the mean
- Upper bound: 122-123 years based on verified records

I choose this as my base rate because the maximum human lifespan has shown remarkable stability despite significant increases in average life expectancy over the past century.

## 2. Comparison to Base Case

**Similarities to base rate:**
- Biological limits to human aging appear relatively fixed despite medical advances
- The gap between maximum lifespan and average life expectancy has persisted
- Verified supercentenarians remain extremely rare (fewer than 100 worldwide)

**Differences from base rate:**
- By 2100, we'll have 75 more years of potential medical advances
- Increased focus on aging research specifically targeting longevity extension
- Larger global population increases the statistical probability of outliers
- Potential for breakthrough technologies specifically targeting the aging process

## 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)

**Evidence for higher values:**
- Growing aging population and increased focus on longevity research (moderate upward push)
- Potential for breakthroughs in geroscience and biotechnology (strong upward push if realized)
- Genetic factors showing some individuals have predispositions for extreme longevity (moderate upward push)
- 75 years is a long time for scientific advancement (strong upward push)

**Evidence for lower values:**
- Studies show life expectancy gains have slowed significantly since 1939 (strong downward push)
- Most public health improvements have already been realized in developed countries (moderate downward push)
- Maximum lifespan has remained relatively stable despite doubling of average life expectancy (strong downward push)
- Environmental factors like pollution and climate change may negatively impact longevity (moderate downward push)

## 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)

Starting with my prior centered around 117-118 years with a relatively narrow variance:

**Update 1: Slowing life expectancy gains**
- This evidence suggests the biological limits to human lifespan are difficult to overcome
- Likelihood ratio: This makes lower values (~115-120) about 2× more likely than higher values (>125)
- Posterior shift: Mean shifts slightly downward to ~116-117 years

**Update 2: Potential medical breakthroughs over 75 years**
- This evidence suggests some probability of extending maximum lifespan
- Likelihood ratio: This makes higher values (~120-130) about 3× more likely than in the base rate
- Posterior shift: Mean shifts upward to ~120-122 years, and the distribution becomes more right-skewed with a longer tail

**Update 3: Increased focus on aging research**
- This evidence suggests targeted efforts to extend maximum lifespan
- Likelihood ratio: This makes higher values (~125-135) about 1.5× more likely
- Posterior shift: Mean shifts slightly upward to ~122-124 years, with increased probability in the right tail

**Final posterior:**
- Mean: ~122-124 years
- More right-skewed than the prior, with a longer tail for potential breakthroughs
- Still maintains significant probability mass around the historical maximum (~122 years)

## 5. Red Team Thinking

**Potential blind spots:**
- I may be underestimating the potential for transformative medical breakthroughs that could dramatically extend lifespan
- I might be overestimating the stability of biological limits to aging
- The Metaculus community forecast suggests a higher value than my analysis

**Alternative scenarios:**
- Radical breakthrough scenario: A fundamental understanding of aging leads to interventions that push maximum lifespan to 140+ years
- Stagnation scenario: No significant advances occur, keeping maximum lifespan around current levels (~115-122)
- Decline scenario: Environmental factors or other stressors actually reduce maximum lifespan below current levels

**Best alternative forecast:**
A more optimistic forecast might place the median around 130-135 years, arguing that 75 years is sufficient time for transformative medical advances. The counterargument is that despite a century of medical progress, maximum lifespan has remained remarkably stable, suggesting biological constraints that are difficult to overcome.

After considering these alternatives, I'll widen my distribution slightly to account for greater uncertainty in the upper tail, while maintaining significant probability mass around the historical maximum.

### 1. Base Rate (Prior) Selection
The target variable is the age of the oldest living person in 2100. A natural reference class is the historical record of maximum human lifespan. The oldest verified person, Jeanne Calment, died at 122 in 1997. Other recent supercentenarians have reached ages between 115 and 119. The trend over the 20th century showed a slow but steady increase in the maximum age.

Based on this, a prior distribution should be centered slightly above Calment's record, acknowledging the passage of over a century (1997-2100). However, the fact that her record has stood for so long suggests a potential plateau.

Therefore, I'll set a prior with a median (P50) of **123 years**. The distribution will be wide to reflect uncertainty, with a plausible low end where the record is barely broken and a high end that allows for some medical progress.
-   **Prior Median:** 123 years
-   **Prior Spread (P10-P90):** Roughly 119 to 130 years. This is a right-skewed distribution, as breakthroughs could lead to large positive deviations, while biological limits constrain the low end.

### 2. Comparison to Base Case
The period from now until 2100 differs from the 20th-century base case in several key ways:

*   **Similarities:** The fundamental biological mechanisms of aging remain the same, and the societal desire to extend life continues to drive research.
*   **Differences (Headwinds):** The "low-hanging fruit" of public health (sanitation, vaccines) has been picked, leading to a documented slowdown in life expectancy gains. New environmental stressors like climate change could also negatively impact longevity.
*   **Differences (Tailwinds):**
    1.  **Statistical Effect:** The global population of elderly people, particularly centenarians, is projected to increase dramatically by 2100 (from ~600k to potentially over 10 million). Extreme value theory dictates that a larger sample size will likely produce a higher maximum value, even with no change in underlying biology. This is a very strong upward pressure.
    2.  **Technological Potential:** We are in an era of advanced biotechnology (genomics, cellular reprogramming) with the potential for breakthroughs in geroscience that did not exist previously. This creates significant upside potential.

### 3. Evidence Evaluation (Likelihoods)
I will evaluate the key pieces of evidence from the report and other sources:

*   **Slowing Life Expectancy Gains (↓ Large):** The report highlights this as a major factor. If the average lifespan is plateauing, it becomes much harder for the maximum to increase. This evidence strongly favors a lower outcome and suggests my prior might be too optimistic.
*   **Growing Elderly Population (↑ Large):** This is a powerful statistical argument. A 10-20x increase in the number of centenarians makes it highly probable that the maximum observed age will increase, purely by chance. This provides a strong upward push, countering the slowing gains in the average.
*   **Potential for Medical Breakthroughs (↑ Moderate):** The report notes the potential for geroscience to extend lifespan. This is the primary driver for the right tail of the distribution (ages 130+). Its effect is more on the skew and variance than the median.
*   **Metaculus Community Forecast (↑ Large):** The Metaculus community predicts a median age of 127. This is a strong signal from a large group of forecasters who have likely considered the same factors. It suggests my initial prior of 123 is too low and that the upward pressures (statistical effect, tech optimism) are weighted more heavily by the community.

### 4. Bayesian Updating (Posterior Distribution)
My process is to start with the prior and adjust it based on the evidence.

*   **Prior:** Median of 123, skewed right.
*   **Update 1 (Slowing Gains):** The evidence of slowing gains pushes my median down, perhaps to 122 (i.e., no progress from Calment).
*   **Update 2 (Population Growth):** The statistical effect of a much larger elderly population is a near-certainty and provides strong upward pressure. This single factor likely pushes the median from 122 back up to at least 124-125.
*   **Update 3 (Metaculus Data):** The Metaculus median of 127 is a very strong piece of evidence. I should update my forecast significantly towards this consensus, as it likely incorporates the population growth argument effectively. I will not adopt it wholesale but will move my median most of the way there.

This leads to a posterior distribution with a median of **126 years**. The distribution remains right-skewed, with the lower end anchored by the current record and the possibility of stagnation, and the upper end stretched by the potential for breakthroughs.

### 5. Red Team Thinking
I must consider how this forecast could be wrong.

*   **Alternative Scenario 1 (Stagnation):** What if Jeanne Calment was a massive statistical outlier and the true biological limit is closer to 118-120? In this case, even with a larger population, we might not break her record. My P10 and P20 values (121, 123) are meant to capture this possibility, assigning a ~20% chance that the record is broken by only one year or less.
*   **Alternative Scenario 2 (Radical Breakthrough):** What if a true rejuvenation therapy is developed and deployed by 2050? A person who is 75 in 2050 (born in 1975) could have their aging process slowed or reversed, potentially living to 140 or 150. They would be 125 in 2100. This scenario would lead to an outcome far in the right tail. My P90 of 135 acknowledges a significant advance but stops short of this more radical, lower-probability outcome. The skew of my distribution accounts for this possibility.

My final distribution seems to balance the strong, competing arguments of biological/historical stagnation versus statistical/technological progress. The heavy weight given to the Metaculus forecast helps correct for potential personal biases (e.g., anchoring too heavily on the Calment record).
