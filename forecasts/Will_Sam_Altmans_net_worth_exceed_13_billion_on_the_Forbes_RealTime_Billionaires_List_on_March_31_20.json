Is Donald Trump To Blame? - News18**\nElon Musk's net worth has fallen below $400 billion for the first time in two months due to a 27% slide in Tesla's share price. The decline is attributed to dismal monthly sales, with deliveries in Germany plummeting 59% and China sales falling 11.5% from last year. Musk's focus on Washington and his involvement in DOGE, a cost-cutting initiative, may be impacting Tesla's performance.
