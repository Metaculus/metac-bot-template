According to Musk, there are over 394 million 'eligible' Social Security numbers in the system, but only 334 million people living in the US. The Social Security Administration estimates that 69 million Americans will receive payments each month, totaling $1.6 trillion in 2025. Musk joked that 'there are a lot of vampires collecting Social Security', as the database shows millions of people over 100 years old still alive and eligible for benefits. Stephen Miller has stated that foreign nationals have been using fake Social Security numbers to steal billions of dollars in benefits. If the full extent of the fraud is uncovered, it will 'shake this nation to the core'. Meanwhile, DOGE has canceled $370 million in taxpayer dollars being spent on DEI programs at the Department of Education, and Robert Kennedy Jr. has slashed staffing at the CDC. The left is desperate to stop what is happening, with at least 74 federal lawsuits filed to stop President Trump and Elon Musk's executive actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[The Most Important News](http://themostimportantnews.com/archives/if-you-think-that-the-left-is-angry-now-just-wait-until-fraudulent-social-security-payments-stop-going-out)\n\n**74 lawsuits filed against Trump to stop his executive actions**\nSince President Donald Trump's return to the White House, at least 74 lawsuits have been filed in federal courts against his administration's executive actions. As of Monday, judges have temporarily paused 18 of these measures. Trump's only victory so far was the approval of his deferred resignation buyout for government employees. However, a federal judge denied immediate reinstatement for eight former inspectors general fired by Trump, and attorneys general from 14 states filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE's ability to access sensitive government data. One case, Hampton Dellinger's, is already headed to the U.S. Supreme Court, with the government petitioning to vacate the district court's decision to temporarily reinstate him to lead the Office of Special Counsel.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[newsnationnow.com](https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/lawsuits-trump-executive-actions/)\n\n**Trump's Government Restructuring Plan Faces Supreme Court Challenge**\nUS President Donald Trump has attempted to drastically reduce the number of employees and costs in government agencies, but so far, US judges have blocked his plans in several cases. The Justice Department is now taking the matter to the Supreme Court, which has never before dealt with the large-scale government restructuring. The Justice Department has filed an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court to enforce the dismissal of the head of an agency responsible for protecting whistleblowers. The agency's leader, Hampton Dellinger, was fired by the White House on February 7, but he has appealed the decision, which was subsequently put on hold by a federal court. The government then appealed this decision to a federal appeals court, but lost. The Justice Department is now appealing to the Supreme Court, calling the previous court decisions 'an unprecedented attack on the separation of powers'. Trump wants to drastically reduce the number of employees and costs in government agencies, with the support of tech billionaire Elon Musk, who leads a new government agency for state efficiency. However, around 40 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration's plans, and around a dozen injunctions have been issued to block the government's actions. Trump is relying on the Supreme Court to ultimately win the legal battles over his government agenda. The Supreme Court is dominated by conservative judges, three of whom were nominated by Trump during his first term (2017-21).\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Supreme-Court-entscheidet-ueber-Trumps-Behoerden-Kahlschlag-article25569193.html)\n\n**Trump's Government Overhaul Lands in Supreme Court for First Time**\nThe Trump administration has filed a new request to the Supreme Court, calling previous court decisions in the Dellinger case a 'unprecedented attack on the separation of powers'. The request claims that no other case in American history has forced a president to keep a government official in office against their will. Trump plans to overhaul the federal government, with the support of Elon Musk, who leads a new government agency for state efficiency (Doge). However, over 40 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration's plans, and the government has been restrained by around a dozen court orders. According to the Trump administration, 'no other case in American history' has forced a president to keep a government official in office against their will, as stated in the new request.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[stern.de](https://www.stern.de/news/streit-um-trumps-behoerden-umbau-landet-erstmals-vor-oberstem-gericht-35474394.html)\n\n**Trump and Musk's Department of Government Efficiency Project Sparks Chaos and Criticism**\nSince Trump's return as president on January 20, he and Musk have been making drastic cuts in federal spending at an alarming rate with their Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) project. However, it has been revealed that some of the layoffs, including 300 people at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), were done by mistake. The NNSA, which has around 1,800 employees, is responsible for preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and maintaining the US nuclear arsenal. The organization has been struggling to contact the employees who were laid off due to a lack of contact information. 'We have tried to retract the termination letters, but we don't have a good way to reach them,' the NNSA leadership wrote in an internal email obtained by NBC News. The employees who were laid off on Thursday have lost access to their government email accounts. 'Please work with your superiors and send this information (when you get it) to people's personal email addresses,' they wrote in the email. The criticism of Trump and Musk's methods has been intense, with many critics saying that much of what they are doing is illegal and outside of their authority. Over 60 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration. The pace of the layoffs has led to chaos, with people who were not meant to be laid off losing their jobs. The layoffs also occurred at a dramatic time, just hours before a Russian drone was suspected of attacking the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine. - I will quit, said one employee, who was initially laid off but then had her termination retracted. 'I will continue to look for another job. I will go back, but as soon as I find something else, I will quit.' Musk is leading a small team of young data experts, who have also been given access to sensitive information. - This puts everyone at risk, said US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a former Democratic presidential candidate. 'The incompetence in Washington puts all Americans at risk, regardless of how you voted. No one should be satisfied with the DOGE team - that the same people who accidentally published graded, American security information on the internet today - will have access to your bank account number and social security number.'\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 01:36 AM\nSource:[dagbladet.no](https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/atomvapen-tabbe-sjokkerende-slurvete/82688155)\n\n**The Only \u201cConstitutional Crisis\u201d is That Democrats Lost, Now They\u2019re Trying To Govern from the Courtroom**\nDemocrats have launched a well-organized lawfare campaign against the Trump administration, with over 800 lawyers at 280 organizations developing cases to challenge 600 'priority legal threats'. The project, called Democracy 2025, aims to oppose Trump policies and has already seen several dozen lawsuits filed in the first three weeks of the administration. Critics argue that this is creating a 'constitutional crisis' as federal judges are being asked to usurp executive powers and make policy judgments. The author of the article argues that the real crisis is that Democrats lost the election and are trying to govern from the courtroom, rather than allowing the executive branch to function. The author hopes that the Supreme Court will soon intervene to clarify the role of the judiciary in relation to the executive branch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[legalinsurrection.com](https://legalinsurrection.com/2025/02/the-only-constitutional-crisis-is-that-democrats-lost-now-theyre-trying-to-govern-from-the-courtroom/)\n\n**How we\u2019re tracking Vermont\u2019s lawsuits against the Trump administration**\nVermont's Attorney General, Charity Clark, has filed five lawsuits against the Trump administration since his second term began, with more expected in the coming weeks. Clark's office has been reviewing executive orders and actions taken by the president to determine if they are constitutional or illegal. Clark stated, 'My goal is to block every unconstitutional or illegal act taken by the Trump administration \u2014 full stop.' The latest lawsuit argues that Elon Musk's 'Department of Government Efficiency' has no legal authority to cut federal government programs and spending. Clark said, 'Unelected billionaire Elon Musk has been wreaking havoc on our government, destroying careers, upending critical programs that support Vermonters, and putting our national security at risk.' The lawsuit seeks an injunction barring Musk and other officials from making changes to the federal government and invalidating any actions taken so far. A federal judge has already issued a temporary order restraining the administration's efforts to slash billions of dollars in federal funding for public health research.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[vtdigger.org](https://vtdigger.org/2025/02/15/how-were-tracking-vermonts-lawsuits-against-the-trump-administration/)\n\n**Anger, chaos as federal workers face mass layoffs**\nThe Trump administration's effort to shrink the federal workforce by laying off probationary employees has sparked anger and chaos among workers. According to government data, 220,000 workers had less than a year on the job as of March 2024. The layoffs, which began on Thursday night, have impacted workers across the country, including researchers, special education specialists, and student aid officials. Some employees who had already accepted the administration's deferred resignation offer were still laid off, raising questions about the process. The administration's goal is to make the government more efficient, but critics argue that the random and scattershot approach is unfair and will have a devastating impact on agency missions and government operations. Labor activists and government workers have rallied to protest the cuts, and a lawsuit has been filed challenging the unlawful terminations.

The cases have challenged President Donald Trump's hard-line immigration policies, efforts to slash the size and reach of federal agencies, and roll back civil rights protections and diversity programs. According to Nancy Gertner, a Harvard Law School senior lecturer and retired Boston federal judge, 'Advocates will want to go to places that they perceive to be more sympathetic.' However, the Trump administration's opponents have not turned to single-judge divisions, a move that can ensure predictability in who hears a case. So far, at least 17 judges have orders in place blocking or temporarily halting actions by Trump's administration. Advocacy groups and Democratic attorneys general have declined to talk publicly about their strategy when it comes to where they're suing the Trump administration.

The National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education and other plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit targeting two orders that aim to bring back fairness and promote meritocracy over diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. The Trump administration has also faced lawsuits over its 'Fork in the Road' program, which allowed federal workers to quit voluntarily in exchange for several months of payments.

Additionally, human rights organizations have filed a lawsuit against the order limiting the provision of US citizenship by birthright. The National Treasury Employees Union, representing the interests of employees of 37 federal agencies and departments, filed a lawsuit against President Trump, citing his order that simplifies the dismissal of high-ranking government officials. The lawsuit also states that the order will 'radically transform the public service' and lead to a significant increase in the number of employees at risk of dismissal. The White House responded by stating that the lawsuit was filed by 'leftists' and that 'the Trump administration is ready to meet them in court.' Human rights organizations have also filed a lawsuit against the order limiting the provision of US citizenship by birthright, stating that it contradicts the American Constitution. 'Citizenship by birth is part of what makes the US a strong and dynamic country,' said Anthony Romero, head of the American Civil Liberties Union. Trump entered office on January 20, 2025, and immediately signed nearly 200 executive orders, memoranda, and directives. His first act was to repeal 78 'harmful' orders by Biden and pardon 1,500 people convicted of the 2021 Capitol attack.

Another lawsuit was filed over the creation of the US Department of Government Efficiency, with Elon Musk as one of its chairmen. The plaintiffs claim that Musk's appointment may lead to conflicts of interest and transparency rules that are legally required for all agencies and departments related to the presidential administration.

However, Trump's administration has also had some successes, particularly in the area of immigration. As Trump returns to office, California is preparing for another round of legal battles. The state's attorney general, Rob Bonta, has already begun preparing lawsuits, and the governor, Gavin Newsom, has called a special legislative session to 'protect' California from Trump's policies. California is also allocating $50 million to fight Trump in court, a move that Republicans have criticized as a 'secret fund' for 'hypothetical battles'. Trump's second administration may be more strategic and careful in its decision-making, but California is still expected to challenge many of its policies. The state's history of winning cases against Trump's administration suggests that it will continue to be a thorn in the side of the new administration. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 01:35 PM\nSource:[almanacnews.com](https://www.almanacnews.com/calmatters/2025/01/20/hemos-revisado-las-demandas-de-california-contra-donald-trump-te-mostramos-cuales-gano-el-estado-y-cuales-perdio/)\n\n",
