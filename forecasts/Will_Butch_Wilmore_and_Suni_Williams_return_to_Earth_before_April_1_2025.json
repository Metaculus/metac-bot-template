All questions answered | Today News**\nSunita Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore have been staying aboard the International Space Station (ISS) since June 5, 2024, due to a technical glitch in their Boeing Starliner. Despite health concerns arising from the extended stay, NASA plans their return in March 2025 via SpaceX Crew Dragon. According to NASA, the astronauts, including Williams and Wilmore, will travel back to Earth aboard the Crew-10 capsule, which is scheduled to launch on March 12 at 7:48 p.m. EDT. The spacecraft is expected to start its return journey by the end of March.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:11 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/news/sunita-williams-return-when-and-how-will-she-return-to-earth-after-months-of-delay-nasa-spacex-crew-dragon-iss-11740617251520.html)\n\n**Astronauts Clash with Elon Musk Over ISS Incident**\nAstronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore were stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) in June 2024 due to technical issues with the Boeing Starliner. Elon Musk recently claimed that they were 'abandoned' by the Biden administration and 'left there for political reasons.' However, astronaut Andreas Morgensen responded, 'What a lie. And from someone who complains about a lack of honesty in the media.' Musk fired back, 'You're completely disabled. SpaceX could have returned them a few months ago. I proposed it directly to the Biden administration, but they refused. The return was delayed for political reasons. Idiot.' Morgensen continued, 'You're not even sending a rescue ship now.' Scott Kelly, a former ISS commander, defended Morgensen, saying, 'I was the commander of ISS when Andreas Morgensen went on his first mission. He's one of the most competent, trustworthy, and honest people (...). This rhetoric goes beyond any limits, but unfortunately, it's not surprising.' Musk then attacked Scott Kelly's brother, Captain Mark Kelly, the ambassador of Arizona. 'This idiot publicly attacked me without knowing what really happened. And by the way, your brother claims to be independent, but he's actually just a puppet supporting the Democratic Party.' Mark Kelly responded by challenging Musk to a meeting, saying, 'How about you finally gather the courage to get on a rocket and come talk to us three.' He also offered to go to space with Musk, saying, 'If you're ready to fly in space, I'll go with you.' Kelly concluded, 'He should stop trying to drag our astronauts into political battles.'\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 05:08 PM\nSource:[gazetapl](https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/7,114881,31725253,astronauci-wsciekli-na-muska-slynny-kapitan-rzucil-mu-wyzwanie.html)\n\n**NASA's SpaceX Crew-9 to Discuss Mission, Return**\nNASA's SpaceX Crew-9 astronauts, Nick Hague, Suni Williams, and Butch Wilmore, will discuss their mission and return to Earth during a news conference on the International Space Station on Tuesday, March 4.

The Crew-9 team, which includes NASA astronauts Nick Hague, Sunita Williams, and Butch Wilmore, along with Roscosmos cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov, recently had a refresher training to get ready for their return to Earth. The Crew-10 mission will use a Dragon spacecraft that has flown before, helping speed up the launch and showing how reusable space technology is both useful and efficient. The return of a SpaceX Crew Dragon from the International Space Station is a precisely orchestrated event, marked by careful speed management. The spacecraft encounters the atmosphere at 17,500 miles per hour, and atmospheric friction decelerates it. The PICA-X heat shield absorbs heat, reaching 1,600 degrees Celsius. The spacecraft slows down rapidly, experiencing strong forces that push against it. Plasma formation causes a communications blackout. The spacecraft then deploys parachutes, reducing speed to 15-17 miles per hour, and splashes down in the ocean. Recovery teams approach, and the crew is transported to land.

NASA decided to delay their return and instead, the next crew, Crew 9, was sent to the station with only two members, who will take Williams and Wilmore back to Earth in March 2025. Musk recently stated that the astronauts could have returned to Earth much earlier, but were delayed due to political reasons. Mogensen responded, saying, 'What a lie.

The duo was initially scheduled to return in late March, but NASA and SpaceX decided to accelerate the plans after pressure from US President Donald Trump. They will return with the Crew-9 mission crew. According to NASA, 'the opportunity for an early launch is available after a mission management decision to adjust the original agency plan to fly a new Dragon spacecraft for the Crew-10 mission that requires additional processing time.' Williams and Wilmore were originally scheduled to return on the Boeing Starliner spacecraft, but technical issues forced the mission to be delayed multiple times.

A new plan has been announced, which includes launching a new capsule on March 12 to bring Wilmore and Williams back. The special flight organized by Axiom Space, which includes astronauts from Poland, Hungary, and India, will be delayed. In January, US President Donald Trump asked Elon Musk and SpaceX to ensure the astronauts' return. Williams and Wilmore were sent to the ISS on June 5 for a week-long test flight of the Boeing Starliner capsule. However, due to a technical malfunction, their return date was delayed, and NASA ordered the capsule to return empty. It was estimated that their return to Earth would not be possible before late March or early April, with a stay on the ISS of around 10 months.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 06:31 AM\nSource:[TRT](https://www.trt.net.tr/portuguese/ciencia-e-tecnologia/2025/02/16/astronautas-retidos-na-estacao-espacial-ha-mais-de-8-meses-poderao-regressar-a-terra-mais-cedo-2239553)\n\n**NASA Announces Return Date for Astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams**\nNASA has announced that astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams will return to Earth on March 19 aboard the SpaceX Crew-9 mission.

The delay is due to technical complications and strategic decisions. The mission, originally designed to last eight days, has been extended due to issues with the Starliner capsule's systems, including helium leaks, unreliable safety parameters, and anomalous noises. Despite the delays, NASA has assured that the health and safety of the astronauts are not at risk. The International Space Station (ISS) has been adequately resupplied, allowing the astronauts to continue their scientific experiments and maintenance activities. The decision to postpone the return is also linked to the need to prepare a new Dragon capsule for the next mission. The situation is not unusual, as delays are a normal part of spaceflight routine, especially for experimental missions. The use of the Starliner capsule, developed by Boeing, is a key step towards the United States' independence in space. Wilmore and Williams have demonstrated determination and resilience in the face of challenges, aware of the historical importance of their contribution to the American space program.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 31, 2024 07:20 AM\nSource:[tecnologia.libero.it](https://tecnologia.libero.it/astronauti-bloccati-nello-spazio-rinvio-ritorno-marzo-2025-96825)\n\n",
