The Brutalist has received critical acclaim, winning several critics' awards and being nominated for the Golden Globes, BAFTAs, and Critics Choice Awards. Director Brady Corbet and the film's cast have been praised for their performances, with Adrien Brody's lead role being compared to Cillian Murphy's Oscar-winning performance in Oppenheimer.

Brody's previous win for Best Actor for his role in The Pianist makes him the only previous Oscar winner in the Best Actor category this year. If he wins, he would be two for two at the Academy Awards. A24's recent success in Best Actor, including Brendan Fraser's win for The Whale, could also help Brody's chances.

Additionally, some rare films win four or more Oscars if they have widespread acclaim across technical and creative categories. Therefore, I start with the assumption that the distribution of Oscar wins for acclaimed films often sees a slight skew towards winning a small number, with '0-1' being more common than '4 or more'.
