According to data collected by Morning Consult between January 21 and 27, 2025, approval and disapproval rates vary significantly from country to country. Narendra Modi of India leads the list with 75% approval, followed by Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico with 66%. However, 6% of respondents in India and 7% in Mexico expressed no clear opinion about their respective leaders. Modi's disapproval rate is 19%, while Sheinbaum faces 26% disapproval. In Argentina, Javier Milei has 65% approval, but 30% of respondents disapprove. In Europe, Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland has 56% support, with 24% of people without an opinion and 20% disapproving. In the US, Donald Trump remains a polarizing figure with 52% approval, 10% of respondents without an opinion, and 38% disapproving. In Australia, Anthony Albanese has 46% approval, but 42% of citizens disapprove. In the Netherlands, Dick Schoof maintains moderate approval, with disapproval close behind. Similar situations are seen in Poland, where Donald Tusk faces higher disapproval than approval. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni faces a complicated situation with higher disapproval than approval. In Sweden, Ulf Kristersson is in a similar situation, with high levels of disapproval, while in South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa also experiences majority disapproval. Other leaders, such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, also face significant disapproval. In Spain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez is marked by high disapproval rates, despite having considerable support. In Scandinavian countries like Norway and the UK, disapproval rates remain notably high, reflecting widespread discontent.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[Diario La Rep\u00fablica](https://www.larepublica.co/globoeconomia/conozca-cuales-son-los-indicadores-de-aprobacion-de-24-lideres-mundiales-en-2025-4058077)\n\n**Trump's approval ratings: What the latest polls show**\nPresident Donald Trump's approval ratings have improved significantly since his second term began. According to FiveThirtyEight polling averages, Trump's net favorability rating has narrowed from 8.6 percentage points underwater on Election Day to 0.6 percentage points underwater. When evaluating his performance as president, Trump has a 49% approval rating and 44% disapproval rating nationally. This is a significant improvement from his ratings in February 2017, when he had a 44% approval rating and 48% disapproval rating. However, Trump's numbers still lag behind those of his two Democratic predecessors, President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama, at this point in their presidencies. Trump's favorability rating varies significantly by state, with him being most popular in deep-red states and least popular in solid blue states. Interestingly, Trump's favorability rating is underwater in six of the seven 'swing states' he won last November, suggesting that these voters may have been motivated more by opposition to Democrats than by strong support for Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 09:14 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3591228)\n\n**'Will make the economy worse': Approval plummets as voters blame Trump for market 'chaos'**\nAccording to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, unemployment stayed under 4.0 percent from February 2022 through April 2024, contradicting Donald Trump's claims that the economy was terrible under Joe Biden. Despite this, Trump narrowly defeated Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. However, voter frustration over inflation worked in Trump's favor. Wall Street Journal reporters Rachel Wolfe and Joe Pinsker found that consumer confidence is declining during Trump's second presidency due to tariff threats, stock market swings, and reversing executive orders. Paul Bisson, a 58-year-old Trump voter, expressed his concerns about the economy, stating, 'I don't like the turbulence. I don't like the chaos in the market.... That will make the economy worse, and that's not what we signed up for.' Nicholas Schuch, a 38-year-old Harris voter, is considering moving to a country with a better monetary policy, such as Switzerland, due to the perceived chaos in the market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 06:28 PM\nSource:[Alternet.org](https://www.alternet.org/trump-consumer-confidence/)\n\n**Americans are wary of Trump\u2019s Gaza plan. Plus, politics is hell**\nA recent YouGov survey found that 47% of Americans oppose the US taking ownership of the Gaza Strip, while 22% support the idea. Despite this, President Donald Trump's net favorability rating is -0.6 percentage points, but his net job approval rating is +5.6 points. Americans seem to like some of Trump's policies, such as mass deportations and limiting gender-affirming care for minors, but dislike him personally. A Gallup survey found that half of the 14 politicians or Trump-aligned figures asked about had net-negative favorability, including Trump himself. The survey also found that 73% of Americans oppose Trump using the government to investigate and prosecute his enemies. Americans are generally unhappy with politics and politicians, with 22% of registered voters feeling hopeful about the direction of the nation, 17% feeling scared, 14% feeling depressed, and 15% feeling angry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[dailykos.com](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/2/8/2302095/-Americans-are-wary-of-Trump-s-Gaza-plan-Plus-politics-is-hell?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=top_news_slot_1&pm_medium=web)\n\n**Trump's numbers are weak**\nDonald Trump's approval ratings are weak, with 49.8% approval and 42.8% disapproval, or a net +7.0, making him the second-least popular president in his first week in office. This is similar to his ratings in 2017, when he had 44.6% approval and 41.4% disapproval, or a net +3.2. In contrast, Joseph Biden had an initial net rating of +21.8, while Barack Obama had +46.9. Half of all Americans expect Trump to be a 'poor' or 'terrible' president. Americans also lack confidence in Trump's appointments, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kash Patel as Federal Bureau of Investigation director, Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, and Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Additionally, Americans generally reject Trump's handling of immigration, with a majority opposing his proposals to deport undocumented immigrants, use active duty military to find undocumented immigrants, and separate families during deportation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 09:02 PM\nSource:[Inquirer](https://opinion.inquirer.net/180669/trumps-numbers-are-weak)\n\n**Public Anticipates Changes With Trump but Is Split Over Whether They Will Be Good or Bad**\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted from January 27 to February 2, 2025, among 5,086 adults found that 47% of Americans approve of Donald Trump's job performance, a higher rating than at any point during his first term. However, his post-inauguration approval rating is lower than that of most other presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan. The survey also found that 55% of Republicans say GOP congressional leaders do not have an obligation to support Trump's policies if they disagree with him. Republicans are upbeat about Trump's actions and agenda, but Democrats find little to like. The public is split on whether Trump will be a successful president, with 35% saying he will be successful and 31% saying it is too early to tell. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, while just 12% of Democrats are satisfied. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[pewresearch.org](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/02/07/public-anticipates-changes-with-trump-but-is-split-over-whether-they-will-be-good-or-bad/)\n\n**Trumpilocks: A New Era for the US Economy?**\nMany investors are betting on Donald Trump, but some experts warn of a shift in the market sentiment. Benoit Anne, an expert at MFS Investment Management, says, 'This time is over.' He believes that the US economy is moving into a new macroeconomic regime, which he calls 'Trumpilocks.' The Federal Reserve may pause its monetary policy easing due to strong US growth and persistent inflation. Investment banks have reduced their expectations for further interest rate cuts in 2025. Vanyo Walter from RoboMarkets says, 'Two interest rate cuts of 0.5 points in 2025 are the highest of the feelings, if the underlying data remains the same.' However, most analysts believe that the US economy is not yet at its peak. The US economy is still growing well and behaving as if it is in the middle of the cycle. MFS experts warn of the risk of overheating. Projections from the Federal Reserve banks in Atlanta and New York indicate a 3% economic growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2024. This would be a positive sign for US stocks and growth titles. However, there are still uncertainties, especially in the first quarter. Apple, for example, is seen as skeptical by some analysts due to high valuation ratios and is trading at $225, the same price as when Trump took office. Carsten Mumm from Donner & Reuschel is more optimistic, believing that Trump's aggressive approach will boost the mood of many companies. He expects a rising production rate in the service sector and industry. The outcome of the upcoming earnings season will depend on the tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon. The 'Magnificent 7' are expected to drive the market with a predicted profit growth of around 20%, while the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to contribute only a 3% growth rate.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 01:27 PM\nSource:[finanzen.net](https://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/zertifikate/benjamin-feingold-kolumne-trumpilocks-wird-trump-es-schon-richten-14217994)\n\n**Voters Rate Trump More Aggressive on Trade Policy**\nA recent Rasmussen Reports survey found that 48% of Likely U.S. Voters rate Donald Trump as doing a good or excellent job of handling trade issues, with 34% giving him excellent marks.

His favorability rating is currently averaging +1.2 points, with 48.9% of respondents viewing him favorably and 47.7% holding an unfavorable opinion, according to the Real Clear Politics tracker. FiveThirtyEight's favorability tracker also indicates that Trump's popularity is on the rise, with his average currently standing at -0.6.

This gives him a net positive score of 0.9 points, his highest ever score. However, he still has the lowest favorability rating of any newly inaugurated president since 1953. A recent poll by DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners found that 39% of respondents had developed a more positive view of Trump during the past two months, with reasons including 'country', 'president', and 'America'. Those with a less positive view cited Trump's actions, including his deportation policies and his targeting of certain countries, with some using the word 'felon' to describe him. As J.L. Partners cofounder James Johnson said, 'More voters than is usual in our polarized system do seem to have genuinely rallied around him as he was inaugurated and, going by the popularity of his initial acts -- especially deportation of illegal migrants -- that's no surprise.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 04:50 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14359407/donald-trump-polls-favorability.html)\n\n**Trump Approval Rating Looks Fragile at Start of Second Term**\nDonald Trump's approval rating has been consistently low throughout his presidency, with a negative net favorability ratio since his first term. His current job-approval average is 49.1% positive and 43.9% negative, down slightly from Inauguration Day. Gallup's January 2025 poll shows Trump at 47% positive, 48% negative, with a personal favorability of 46.4% favorable and 48.0% unfavorable. This is in contrast to Joe Biden's approval rating at a similar point in his presidency, which was 53.8% positive and 33.4% negative. Trump's low approval rating may be affected by upcoming fights over congressional budget decisions, mass deportation, and his tendency to overreach, which could drive his popularity down further.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-approval-rating-start-second-term.html)\n\n**Dems' Favorability Underwater By 26 Points While Trump Enjoys Net Positive Rating, Poll Shows**\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that the Democratic Party has a net unfavorable rating of -26, with only 31% of respondents having a favorable view and 57% having an unfavorable view.

This is a significant improvement from his net favorability rating of -8.6 points on November 5, 2024. Trump's rising popularity is attributed to a uniform shift in attitudes among every demographic group, except people aged 65+, where his favorable percentage has declined by only 1 point. Even Democrats now rate Trump better than they did before the election. However, it is unclear whether this is a permanent shift or a temporary 'honeymoon period' for the president-elect. Some experts suggest that Trump's ratings may fall once he assumes office and starts enacting policies, while others propose that the increase in popularity may be an illusion due to changes in survey methodology or respondent demographics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 06:26 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-popular/story?id=117620918)\n\n**Has Trump Crossed the Streams?**\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, Donald Trump may have become more popular than unpopular for the first time in his political life. Trump's net-positive favorable rating has increased since Election Day, with a recent poll showing a +2 favorability among all adults and a +1 among registered voters. This trend is also seen in RealClearPolitics, which aggregates polls without weighting. Trump's increased popularity may be due to the public's fatigue with media and Democrat criticism, or the collapse of the cover-up around Joe Biden's presidency and cognitive decline. Biden's job approval numbers have declined precipitously, with a net-unfavorable -17.8 in FiveThirtyEight. Trump will assume office as a reasonably popular figure, despite the media headwinds.

Historically, significant improvements in favorability ratings for controversial figures are uncommon unless associated with actions that bridge political divides or external events that substantially alter public perception.
