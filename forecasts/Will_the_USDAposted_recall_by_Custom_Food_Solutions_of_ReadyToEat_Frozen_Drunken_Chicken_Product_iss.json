The recalls are due to possible salmonella contamination, metal fragments, undeclared milk, and undeclared walnuts. Consumers are advised to check their products and make sure they haven't been recalled. The FDA warns that recalled foods may cause injury or illness, especially for people who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems. 'It is important that consumers be aware of recalls because recalled foods may cause injury or illness,' the FDA said. The recalled products include: 858 cases of Aleppo Tahini Paste from Turkana, 20-ounce carton packages of Casa Mamita Chicken & Cheese Taquitos, 7,920 bags of Greenwise Organic Pecan Halves from Pecan Star and Nut Corp, and certain bags of Lay's Classic Potato Chips from Frito-Lay.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 11:09 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/super-bowl-party-food-recall-list-warnings-issued-2028041)\n\n**Norovirus outbreak linked to Louisiana oysters prompts multi-state recall**\nA norovirus outbreak linked to contaminated oysters from Louisiana has prompted a multi-state recall. At least 15 people in Louisiana reported norovirus symptoms after eating the oysters in restaurants. The Louisiana Department of Health has issued a recall for the oysters, which were harvested between January 10 and February 4, and closed the area for harvesting for at least 21 days. The FDA is advising restaurants and food retailers not to serve or sell the oysters, and consumers not to eat them. According to the FDA, norovirus symptoms include diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and stomach pain, and can lead to dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Oysters are particularly susceptible to contamination because they are filter feeders and can accumulate microorganisms present in the water.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 05:46 PM\nSource:[rocketcitynow.com](https://www.rocketcitynow.com/article/news/local/alabama-mississippi-georgia-included-warning-oysters-norovirus/525-68c750cb-f6df-4cb1-91b7-7981e5f02d0d)\n\n**Lidl issues urgent recall after popular snack burns people's mouths**\nLidl has issued an urgent recall for two Alpenfest Salted Mini Pretzel products due to a potential burning sensation in the mouth, and Deluxe Cheddar Cheese Wedges in Northern Ireland due to Listeria monocytogenes contamination.
