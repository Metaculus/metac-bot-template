Weeden, who has seen his share of bad weather, including 6 tornadoes in a 12-month period, emphasizes the importance of having a plan in place. 'Always have a plan. What are you going to do when that tornado alarm goes off, where are you going to go, make sure your neighbors know about it. Now is the time for planning,' Weeden said. The county will be conducting a major tornado drill on March 13, involving over 600 first responders and 40 volunteers, to sharpen communication skills and prepare for the worst-case scenario. Weeden notes that the worst possible scenario would be a tornado hitting Main Street, wiping out communications, the hospital, and schools.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:50 AM\nSource:[wbrc.com](https://www.wbrc.com/2025/02/06/west-alabama-ema-director-urges-planning-now-tornado-season/)\n\n**Severe Weather Awareness Week Day 3: what you need to know about tornadoes**\nDay 3 of Severe Weather Awareness Week focuses on tornado and thunderstorm safety. According to the National Weather Service, an average of 800 tornadoes are reported nationwide every year, with the peak season for Florida and surrounding southern states being March through May. Bay County officials emphasize the importance of staying connected and making a plan to stay prepared. 'Being able to receive alerts is the primary of importance. And then the second thing is making sure you have a plan and you know what you\u2019re going to do to react to the issuance of a tornado watch or a tornado warning,' said Bay County manager Bob Majka. A tornado watch is when people should be ready and prepared, while a tornado warning is when they should take action and seek shelter. In 2024, Florida saw over 100 tornadoes, with 6 hitting the Panhandle in January. Officials stress that having a disaster plan is crucial, which includes knowing the best place to seek shelter and checking home insurance coverage. 'We always encourage people, make sure you understand what your insurance policy covers, understand, you know, what those benefits are,' said Majka.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:35 AM\nSource:[mypanhandle.com](https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/severe-weather-awareness-week-day-3-what-you-need-to-know-about-tornadoes/)\n\n**30 Tornadoes in a Year: Unusual Activity in 2024**\nAccording to the French tornado and violent storm observatory, Keraunos, the year 2024 saw a 'higher than normal' tornado activity, with 30 tornadoes recorded in a year, spread over 22 days. This is similar to the activity seen in 2023, but not as high as the record of 50 tornadoes in 2014. Keraunos notes that the year 2024 was marked by a significant tornado, an EF2, which occurred in Carlepont, Oise on June 18, 2024. The tornado activity was unusual, with 'usual' tornadoes in the northwest and more surprising ones in the southwest and center-east.

But 2025 snowstorm offered a rare bit of joy.**\nMike Efferson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Louisiana, has had to deal with many severe weather events in his 17-year career. However, the 2025 snowstorm that brought historic amounts of snow and record cold temperatures to south Louisiana was a rare and magical experience for him and his family. Efferson's daughters, 7-year-old Mariana and 4-year-old Melise, had never seen snow before, and the family enjoyed a fun-filled day playing in the snow, making snow angels, and having a snowball fight. Efferson, who has worked through many devastating weather events, including hurricanes and tornado outbreaks, said that this event was a welcome change from the usual high-pressure situations he faces. 'It was really exciting and it was really hard to believe,' Efferson said.

The National Weather Service expects the final total to be over 1,700 tornadoes, making it the second worst year on record, except for 2004. The year was marked by a lack of significant lull in activity, with smaller active days aggregating to a high total. At least 50 people died, and Oklahoma had its worst year on record with 152 confirmed twisters. Several other states also broke their previous records for tornadoes. Researchers attribute the increase in tornado activity to a particularly active jet stream, the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to neutral conditions, and an exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico. 'We just never really got a break,' said Victor Gensini, an associate professor of meteorology and severe weather at Northern Illinois University. 'This (2024) will be the highest year for insured losses for severe convective storms - including hail, wind and tornadoes - by a large margin,' Gensini said.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2025 10:11 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/expensive-deadly-near-record-number-100806072.html)\n\n**California wildfire alert camera captures video of country\u2019s first tornado of 2025**\nA wildfire alert camera in Northern California captured video of what is believed to be the country's first tornado of 2025.

The tornado was detected by a camera designed to monitor wildfires and smoke, rather than severe weather. According to the National Weather Service, the tornado lasted for 3 minutes and had an estimated path of about 0.8 miles. However, due to its remote location and lack of damage, the tornado was not rated on the Enhanced Fujita Wind Scale. California typically experiences fewer than a dozen tornadoes each year, and they are generally on the weaker end of the scale. The state has seen fewer than 500 reported tornadoes since 1950, resulting in injuries but no fatalities.

This is just behind 2004, which holds the top spot with 1,817 tornadoes. Notably, 2024 has recorded the highest number of EF-2+ and EF-3+ tornadoes since 2011, indicating the intensity of this year's storms. In the Houston area, the NWS has confirmed at least 11 tornadoes in just three days in December 2024. The increase in tornadoes is attributed to advances in technology and easier access to reporting, which has led to more accurate documentation of weaker tornadoes.

The season began on February 28 and ended on December 29, with the worst tornado striking the Indian Lake region on March 14, killing three people and injuring dozens. The state's top 10 counties for tornadoes all saw three or more this year. Meteorologist Brandon Peloquin warned that while it's not clear how active the severe weather season in 2025 will be, it's essential that everyone be prepared. Tornado season in Ohio typically peaks between April and June, but March is also a primary month for tornadoes. Tornadoes are confirmed by surveying damage in person, looking for patterns such as larger uprooted trees crossing each other. 'It's been relentless,' Peloquin said about the Ohio tornado season.

The National Weather Service is still conducting storm surveys, and the number is expected to rise. Notable tornado outbreaks this year include the Spring tornadoes, which were the most active April-May period in 74 years, with 883 tornadoes, and the Chicago derecho, which spawned over 46 tornadoes, including 32 in the Chicago area alone. The year also saw a record number of tornadoes in Arkansas and Indiana, and a strong EF3 tornado in Mt. Vernon, Indiana. The final tally for 2024 tornadoes will be confirmed once the NWS finishes all of their storm surveys. Jennifer Gray, a weather and climate writer for weather.com, notes that 2024 has been a historic year for tornadoes, and the final count will be able to confirm how it stacks up in the record books. 'We won't see a full tally from the most recent tornado outbreak until the NWS finishes all of their storm surveys, however, we know that it spawned over two dozen tornadoes, which will only add to the final count for 2024 tornadoes,' Gray said.

The wishes include fewer landfalling hurricanes, quieter severe weather, widespread drought relief, and fewer deadly flood events. In 2024, there were 18 named storms, 11 hurricanes, and 5 major hurricanes, with eight of them making landfall. The year also saw 1,473 confirmed tornadoes, 17 severe weather events, and 166 flood-related deaths. The channel hopes for a quieter severe weather year, with fewer tornadoes and less destruction. They also wish for drought relief, with over a third of the country under drought conditions as of December 24. Additionally, they hope for fewer deadly flood events, with 166 deaths attributed to floods in 2024, significantly higher than the 30-year average of 89 fatalities per year. 'We are hoping a wetter pattern across the South will emerge in the spring of 2025 that will bring more precipitation and hopefully help to diminish drought in those areas,' said the channel. 'We wish next year is much quieter in terms of severe weather and that fewer tornadoes wreak havoc across the country,' they added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 02:09 PM\nSource:[The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/forecast/national/news/2024-12-19-weather-wishes-2025-relief-disasters)\n\n**Tornado Outbreak 'Likely' In The South Through Saturday Night, NOAA's Storm Prediction Center Says**\nA tornado outbreak is 'likely' in parts of the South through Saturday night, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. Strong tornadoes, damaging straight-line winds, large hail, and heavy rainfall are concerns, especially on Saturday and Saturday night. The area at risk includes parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and western Alabama, where a level 4 out of 5 severe weather risk has been issued. The Storm Prediction Center warns that this corridor could see strong, long-track tornadoes (EF3 or higher intensity) if the right atmospheric ingredients come together. The main time of concern is Saturday afternoon into Saturday night, with two rounds of severe thunderstorms possible. Locally flooding rainfall is also a threat through Saturday night from eastern Texas to the Tennessee Valley. Severe storms will continue to march eastward on Sunday into much of the Southeast and extending northward into portions of the upper Ohio Valley and Appalachians.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 11:45 AM\nSource:[Aol](https://www.aol.com/severe-weather-packs-tornado-threat-125435937.html)\n\n**2024 had some wild weather. Here's why.**\nThe 2024 hurricane and tornado seasons were 'hyperactive', with 18 named storms and 1,762 preliminary tornado reports. La Ni\u00f1a conditions, which include cooler than average water temperatures in the eastern Pacific, are to blame. La Ni\u00f1a brings sinking air in the Pacific, which is counteracted by rising air in the Atlantic, making it easier for hurricanes to form. The relationship between La Ni\u00f1a and tornadoes is more nuanced, but research suggests that the Great Plains see an uptick in tornadoes during La Ni\u00f1a years due to the shifting position of the jet stream. This year, La Ni\u00f1a conditions emerged in the autumn, but quick swings between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a can result in booming or busting tornado barrages. The U.S. Great Plains saw repeated onslaughts of destructive tornadoes, and the conditions for next year's weather are uncertain. According to emerging research, if La Ni\u00f1a conditions weaken in the spring and shift back toward El Ni\u00f1o, it could lead to near average or slightly below average hurricane activity, but the Deep South may see extra activity in February or March, and Kansas and Oklahoma may see increased tornado activity in April.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 11:00 AM\nSource:[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/12/26/la-nina-hurricane-tornado-season/)\n\n**The biggest weather stories of the year for Indiana 2024**\nIndiana experienced a year of active weather in 2024, with 57 tornadoes, 91 severe hail reports, and 378 severe wind damage reports.

The St. Louis region has seen more than 40 confirmed tornadoes, with a weak tornado reported near the Lake of the Ozarks and several tornado warnings in the area. The increase in tornadoes is attributed to La Nina Winters, which have been linked to severe weather events in the past.

Over the past decade, March has seen variable tornado activity, typically with the range falling somewhere between 50 and 80 tornadoes according to NOAA statistics. However, there have been outlier years with notably lower or higher counts. This variability suggests that while March is not as tornado-prone as later spring months, it still experiences significant activity. Therefore, I will initialize the probabilities by noting that counts in the mid-range (30 to 79) are historically more common, while very low or very high counts are less frequent.",
