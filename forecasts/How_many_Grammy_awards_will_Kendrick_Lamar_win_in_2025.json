Kendrick Lamar has a strong track record at the Grammys, previously winning 14 Grammys out of a total 47 nominations (as of 2024). This converts to a win rate of approximately 30%. Given seven nominations this year, a simple calculation suggests around two wins are likely, based on past performance alone. Additionally, artists with multiple nominations in a single year who are critical and popular darlings, like Lamar, often win multiple awards, but seldom more than half of their nominations. Thus, our base rates start with '0 or 1' (15%), '2' (40%), '3' (30%), 'Greater than 3' (15%), balancing historical data with general award trends.",
