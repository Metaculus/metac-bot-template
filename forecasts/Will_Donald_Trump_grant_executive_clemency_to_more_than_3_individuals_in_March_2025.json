However, this move comes as Trump simultaneously calls for the death penalty for drug dealers, creating a striking contrast in his approach to criminal justice. Trump stated that Johnson would advise him on cases where pardons were warranted, praising her transformation, saying, 'Alice was in prison for doing something that today probably wouldn't even be prosecuted.' Meanwhile, Trump has repeatedly called for Congress to pass legislation imposing the death penalty for drug traffickers, arguing that such measures are 'very humane' and would serve as a deterrent to crime. However, there is no publicly available data or research to support Trump's claim that each drug dealer is responsible for 500 deaths. Trump's stance on cannabis reform remains unclear, leaving the cannabis industry uncertain about the administration's direction. The appointment of Johnson as a clemency advisor while simultaneously advocating for the death penalty for drug traffickers presents a striking contradiction in Trump's criminal justice approach, raising concerns about fairness and consistency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 07:23 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/25/02/43985645/a-tale-of-two-trumps-clemency-for-some-death-for-others-in-his-drug-policy-approach)\n\n**Imperious Trump Retaliates Against Jack Smith's Lawyers**\nPresident Trump has issued an executive order revoking the security clearances of lawyers at Covington & Burling, who are representing former Special Counsel Jack Smith. Trump also ordered the end of all federal government contracts with the law firm. U.S. District Judge Amir Ali blocked Trump's order to freeze USAID payments, and Trump's administration immediately appealed the ruling. In another development, U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead blocked Trump's executive order pausing refugee admissions. Elon Musk criticized the federal judiciary, while the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Office of Special Counsel have granted stays to federal employees fired by the Trump administration. The White House identified the current administrator of DOGE, but the timeline of her appointment remains unclear. The House passed a budget resolution on a narrow vote, and the real work begins to square the many circles they are still juggling. The White House announced that it will now decide which reporters serve in the press pool, and the Trump Justice Department continues to interpret the President's Jan. 6 act of clemency dangerously broadly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 03:20 PM\nSource:[Talking Points Memo](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/morning-memo/imperious-trump-retaliates-against-jack-smiths-lawyers)\n\n**Early Edition: February 26, 2025 A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the past 24 hours.**\nThe Trump administration has proposed expelling Canada from the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, according to sources. President Trump's close adviser, Peter Navarro, denied pushing the idea. Meanwhile, the UK has announced plans to increase its military spending to 2.5% GDP, ahead of a White House meeting with Trump. Trump has also signed an executive order to investigate foreign production and imports of copper, potentially leading to new tariffs. Additionally, Ukraine and the US have agreed on a minerals deal framework, with President Zelenskyy set to visit Washington to sign the agreement. Some Republican lawmakers have criticized the Trump administration's decision to side with Russia in UN votes on resolutions concerning the war in Ukraine. The Trump administration has also announced plans to introduce a requirement for undocumented migrants to register and provide their fingerprints to the government or face criminal prosecution. Furthermore, Trump has announced he will replace the foreign investor visa program with $5 million 'gold cards' providing green card privileges and a route to citizenship. The Senate has confirmed Dan Driscoll as the next Army Secretary. Two planes were forced to abandon landings at Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport and at Chicago's Midway International Airport to avoid collisions. Federal prosecutors have declared that a Jan. 6 rioter's conviction is covered by Trump's clemency proclamation. Equipment from Elon Musk's Starlink satellite company has been installed in Federal Aviation Administration facilities in a potential bid to take over a $2 billion contract to modernize the US air traffic communications system. The National Association of Secretaries of State has appealed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to safeguard critical election programs and protections during an upcoming agency spending review. Chile's government has imposed a curfew and sent army and national police to patrol the streets after a sweeping blackout cut electricity in most of the country. Taiwan has detained a Togo-flagged cargo ship and its Chinese crew members over the severance of an undersea fiber-optic cable. U.N. experts have urged the international community to respond to 'systematic' and 'serious' human rights violations committed by the Nicaraguan government. A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's refugee admissions ban, saying the move constituted an improper nullification of congressional authority. Six federal probationary employees recently fired by the Trump administration can stay in their jobs for 45 days under a stay issued by the Merit Systems Protection Board.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 12:40 PM\nSource:[justsecurity.org](https://www.justsecurity.org/108392/early-edition-february-26-2025/)\n\n**Trump Reiterates Threat to Impose Tariffs on Mexico and Canada**\nUS President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada, stating that a 25% tariff will be applied to various products, including cars, on April 2. Trump said, 'I'm not going to stop the tariffs. Millions of people have died due to fentanyl entering through the border.' This comes after a meeting with his cabinet, where Elon Musk, a senior advisor to Trump, was also present. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the deadline for discussing the tariffs is March 4, and she did not rule out a meeting with Trump, saying, 'I'm not closing the door to a meeting, but there needs to be an agreement between the two governments.' Sheinbaum had previously negotiated an agreement with the US to avoid the 25% tariffs in exchange for deploying 10,000 National Guard members to the northern border.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[tribunademexico.com](https://tribunademexico.com/aranceles-mexico-abril-reitera-trump/)\n\n**Trump Directs Investigation into Copper Imports, Announces Changes to Immigration Policies**\nUS President Donald Trump has directed an investigation into the impact of copper imports on national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. Trump has signed an executive order to investigate copper imports into the US, citing national security concerns. This move is seen as a precursor to imposing a 25% tariff on copper imports, similar to the tariffs imposed on steel and aluminum in March. A senior US official stated that 'a tariff on copper could help rebuild the US copper industry and strengthen national defense.' The US imports 45% of its annual copper demand, with Chile and Canada being the largest suppliers. South Korea exported $570 million worth of copper products to the US last year. Trump is also set to sign a 'mineral agreement' with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 28, which will grant the US control over Ukraine's mineral resources in exchange for security guarantees. The agreement is expected to modify the initial demand of $50 billion in mineral resources, with the two countries agreeing to jointly develop Ukraine's mineral resources and share the profits. Trump has also announced changes to immigration policies, including a new 'Gold Card' policy that will grant permanent residency to individuals who invest at least $500 million in the US. The policy is expected to take effect in two weeks. Trump stated that 'wealthy individuals and IT companies will invest in the Gold Card program to allow talented individuals to stay in the US long-term.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 05:16 AM\nSource:[IT \uc804\ubb38 \ub274\uc2a4\ud3ec\ud138 \uc804\uc790\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.etnews.com/20250226000279?SNS=00002)\n\n**Shuttered NYC migrant shelter highlights Trump's successful immigration clampdown: NY lawmaker**\nNew York Republican State Assemblyman Jake Blumencranz credits President Donald Trump's immigration clampdown for the closure of the migrant shelter at New York City's Roosevelt Hotel. The hotel, which processed over 173,000 migrants since May 2023, will be shutting down in the next few months. Blumencranz believes that Trump's executive actions have stemmed the flow of migrants entering the country and New York City, resulting in a significant decrease in numbers. He now calls for judicial reforms to remove criminals who have entered the country and committed crimes. 'This is a victory for taxpayers and a disaster for the progressives that have set up policies that have hurt New Yorkers,' Blumencranz said. 'What we need to see now is a system in place that reforms the judicial process, that we can make sure that those 60,000 some odd individuals who have come here and committed crimes are removed,' he added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/shuttered-nyc-migrant-shelter-highlights-trumps-successful-immigration-clampdown-ny-lawmaker)\n\n**Trump's Executive Orders Reflect Influence of Project 2025**\nA group of journalists from Politico compared the executive orders signed by Trump with the document known as Project 2025 and found clear coincidences, including several cases where the language used was identical. According to an analysis by Politico in early February, over 30 ideas and words from the 922-page document of the Heritage Foundation appeared in the president's orders. Despite Trump initially distancing himself from Project 2025 during his 2024 campaign, a closer examination reveals that many of his policy ideas have been incorporated into his administration's actions. The comparison found coincidences in six areas: social issues, immigration, human resources, energy, foreign affairs, and economy. Project 2025 proposals include conservative priorities such as budget cuts and reducing the federal government, as well as more radical changes, such as remodelling the federal workforce and aggressively engaging in cultural wars. The influence of Project 2025 is particularly evident in social issues, including opposition to what he calls the 'woke' agenda, recognizing only two sexes, removing transgender people from the army, reclassifying federal employees to facilitate their dismissal, and appointing loyalists to high government positions, or withdrawing from the World Health Organization. 'It's a very concerning trend,' said Liset Cruz, one of the authors of the research. 'The Project 2025 is a blueprint for a very conservative agenda, and it's being implemented in a very aggressive way.' 'We're seeing a lot of these ideas being implemented in a very short period of time,' added Ali Bianco. 'It's a very concerning trend, and it's something that we need to pay attention to.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 07:08 PM\nSource:[citylimits.org](https://citylimits.org/2025/02/24/podcast-como-el-proyecto-2025-se-refleja-en-las-ordenes-ejecutivas-de-trump/)\n\n**Executive Order On \"Securing Our Borders\"**\nOn January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order imposing new restrictions on migrants, including limitations on asylum and humanitarian protections. The order directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate all categorical parole programs that conflict with U.S. policies, which includes parole processes for Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan nationals. The order also introduces several border security measures, including building more physical barriers, increasing the number of border personnel, and stopping the use of the CBP One mobile application. The order specifically directs the Department of Defense (DOD) and DHS to build more border walls to establish what it calls 'complete operational control' of the southern border. Additionally, it ordered the immediate shutdown of the CBP One mobile app, which previously allowed asylum seekers to schedule appointments at U.S. Ports of Entry. The order also initiates the reinstatement of the 'Remain in Mexico' program, also known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), across all sectors of the southern border. According to the order, 'complete operational control' of the southern border is the goal, but critics argue that these measures will only exacerbate the humanitarian crisis at the border.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 09:27 AM\nSource:[mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/mexico/general-immigration/1588730/executive-order-on-securing-our-borders)\n\n**OPM triggers more RIFs after \u2018clean cleaving\u2019 an entire office**\nThe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is laying off its entire procurement team, affecting 57 employees, as part of a broader effort to reduce its footprint. Acting Director Charles Ezell cited three executive orders issued by President Trump as the reason for the layoffs. Employees will receive severance pay and be eligible to participate in the Reemployment Priority List and the Interagency Career Transition Assistance Plan. However, one impacted employee expressed pessimism about finding new jobs, particularly for remote workers. The move is seen as part of an effort to fold some OPM functions into the General Services Administration, a proposal made by Trump in his first term. Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, expects significant legal challenges to agency actions, citing the Trump administration's 'failure to understand and to use appropriate process' in previous firings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 08:54 AM\nSource:[nextgov.com](https://www.nextgov.com/policy/2025/02/opm-triggers-more-rifs-after-clean-cleaving-entire-office/403205/?oref=ng-homepage-river)\n\n**Donald Trump Grants Clemency to 23 Anti-Abortion Activists**\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 23, granting clemency to 23 anti-abortion activists who were convicted of blocking access to clinics where abortions are performed. 'These people should never have been prosecuted,' Trump said, adding that 'it's a great honor to sign this order.' The announcement came ahead of a major anti-abortion rally in Washington, known as the 'March for Life.' Trump is expected to participate via video conference, while Vice President J.D. Vance will be present in person. Trump had maintained a deliberately ambiguous stance on abortion during his election campaign, saying he would leave the issue to individual states. However, he has repeatedly taken credit for the Supreme Court's decision in June 2022 to end federal protection of the right to abortion, which was made possible by the appointment of three conservative judges during his previous term. Since then, many conservative states have moved to ban or severely limit access to abortion. This is not the first time Trump has granted clemency to a large group of people; on January 20, he pardoned over 1,500 participants in the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 02:30 PM\nSource:[internazionale.it](https://www.internazionale.it/ultime-notizie/2025/01/24/usa-trump-grazia-attivisti-anti-aborto)\n\n**Trump Grants Clemency to 23 Pro-Life Demonstrators**\nFormer President Trump has granted clemency to 23 pro-life demonstrators who were convicted of violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act.

The pardon came ahead of the March for Life, which is scheduled to take place in Washington on Friday. The pro-life movement has welcomed Trump's decision, with Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, saying, 'We thank President Trump for immediately following through on his promise to free pro-life activists who were targeted by Biden's Department of Justice.' Steve Crampton of the Thomas More Society added, 'These heroic, peaceful pro-lifers, who were unjustly imprisoned by Biden's Department of Justice, are now being released and can return home to their families, enjoy a family meal, and experience the freedom that was never supposed to be taken from them in the first place.'\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 12:19 PM\nSource:[kranten.com](https://www.rd.nl/a/1093206-trump-verleent-23-prolifedemonstranten-gratie)\n\n**The Power of Pardons (to Distract)**\nDonald Trump's January 6 pardon spree, which granted clemency to over 1,000 individuals, including those involved in the Capitol riot, has overshadowed a series of significant policy changes initiated through executive orders. These orders, which have the potential to impact immigration enforcement, domestic energy production, and national security, have been met with lawsuits challenging their constitutionality. The fate of these policies will be determined in the courts, with intermediate rulings expected to presage the ultimate fate of the policies. Trump's use of executive orders has been unprecedented, with 220 issued during his first term and 26 on his first inauguration day. While executive orders have their limits, they can have a significant impact on policy and have been used by previous presidents to create sweeping policy initiatives, such as Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. However, Trump's orders have been met with criticism, and the coming legal fights over them will be consequential. As Elie Honig notes, 'History will remember the January 6 pardons. But that history is already made. The executive orders aren't as sensational as the release of hundreds of convicted Capitol rioters.

The pardons were requested by the Thomas More Society, a legal organization that has been advocating for the release of these individuals. The group argued that the Biden administration had misused the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act to target peaceful pro-life activists, and that the prosecutions were unjust and violated the Supreme Court's ruling in Fischer v. U.S. (2024). The pardoned individuals include Joan Bell, Coleman Boyd, Joel Curry, and 19 others, who were convicted of minor trespassing misdemeanors. Trump had pledged to grant clemency to pro-life prisoners of conscience during his 2023 Pray Vote Stand Summit speech. The Biden-Harris administration has not prosecuted anyone under the FACE Act for the 436 church attacks that took place last year, despite pro-life pregnancy resource centers being 22 times more likely to be attacked than abortion facilities.

He also announced his intention to end birthright citizenship, modifying the ius soli. Regarding energy policy, Trump declared a national emergency to increase oil production in Alaska, relaxing environmental regulations and emissions limits. In the workplace, the President ordered federal employees to return to in-person work five days a week, ending remote work arrangements adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also reinstated the 'Schedule F' classification, reducing protections for mid-level federal employees, making it easier to replace them with people aligned with his political agenda.

Trump stated, 'It's for January 6, for the hostages, about 1,500 people who will be completely pardoned.' The pardon applies to all individuals convicted of participating in the assault, except for 14, whose sentences have been commuted to time already served. This includes members of the far-right groups Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, including the founder of Oath Keepers, Stewart Rhodes, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The pardon also annuls ongoing lawsuits against hundreds of individuals. Trump claimed that the participants in the assault were 'treated very unfairly' and that the judges and prosecutors were 'absolutely merciless.' Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Trump's decision, calling it an 'insult to the American judicial system.' Trump has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the January 6, 2021, event, describing it as a 'day of love' and 'overflowing affection' towards him.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 05:50 AM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/international/amerique-nord/etats-unis/donald-trump-gracie-plus-de-1-500-assaillants-du-capitole-qualifies-d-otages_AD-202501210085.html)\n\n**Trump Signs Executive Order Granting Clemency to Capitol Hill Riot Participants**\nUS President Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, granting clemency to approximately 1,500 individuals involved in the 'Capitol Hill riot' and reducing sentences for 14 others. Trump instructed the Attorney General to immediately implement the executive order, ensuring the release of those in custody. According to US media, those granted clemency include riot participants charged with inciting a rebellion and assaulting police officers. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, called Trump's actions 'shameful' and 'a blatant insult to the judicial system.' Trump had previously claimed that the 2020 presidential election was marred by 'massive fraud' and had promised to pardon riot participants on his first day in office. On January 6, 2021, a large group of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, disrupting a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's presidential election victory. The riot resulted in five deaths, numerous police injuries, and significant property damage. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 05:24 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202501213303304247.html)\n\n",

However, analyzing the historical activity, many of his clemency actions tend to occur at strategic times, such as the end of his term or when politically advantageous. If we look at monthly patterns during his presidency, high volumes of clemency actions were not a regular occurrence except during politically expedient times. Considering the current absence of such a terminal event like an end of term, the base rate of granting clemency to three or more individuals in a non-strategic month like March should be conservative. My initial estimate of the probability is based on a base frequency of markedly increased clemency activity occurring in roughly 2 out of 48 months during his term (approximately, as clemency issuances were not necessarily monthly but typically grouped around events). Therefore, initially estimating a base probability for March to see more than three grants of clemency set at approximately 10%.",

                    "points_challenging_prior_analysis": "Trump's simultaneous push for the death penalty for drug dealers highlights a complex approach to clemency that not only involves pardoning but also imposing severe penalties. This duality could signal a more selective approach to clemency, potentially tempering expectations of clemency frequency. Ongoing and potential legal challenges referred to in the reports regarding his executive orders may also restrict his ability to enact clemency freely.",

While the rate varied, there was a notable uptick in clemencies during the last months of his presidency. March represents the early part of the year, but there is no standard seasonal pattern in clemency data for Trump. Assuming a base rate from historical trends, Trump averaged about 2.35 clemencies per month (94 clemencies over 40 months in office). Given Trump's fluctuating pardoning activity and potential opportunistic timing due to personal or political events, estimating an initial probability for more than 3 clemencies during a month at 30% seems reasonable.",
