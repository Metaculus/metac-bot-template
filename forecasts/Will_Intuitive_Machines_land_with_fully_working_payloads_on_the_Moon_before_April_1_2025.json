    "question": "Will Intuitive Machines land with fully working payloads on the Moon before April 1, 2025?",
    "description": "After two slow decades at the beginning of the 21st century, the rate of missions to the Moon [has significantly accelerated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_landing#21st_century_uncrewed_soft_landings_and_attempts). Two missions have already landed on the Moon in 2024 and many more are planned.\n\nOne of them was Intuitive Machines' Nova-C lander, which was the first made by a commercial company to land on the Moon, during the IM-1 mission. An obstacle was however encountered and the satellite stumbled on its side. Two missions are planned for this year with the same lander class that plans to deliver NASA payloads.\n\nIM-2 was planned [for January](https://spacenews.com/ice-hunting-lunar-trailblazer-im2-nearly-ready-january-2025-launch/) but has likely been delayed to [February](https://www.rocketlaunch.live/launch/im-2). Among the payloads of IM-2 are a [mass spectrometer, a rover and a drill](https://www.astronomy.com/space-exploration/the-im-2-moon-mission-will-carry-a-blend-of-science-and-art/) that will search the lunar South Pole for water ice.",
    "fine_print": "For the purpose of this question, a perfect landing will be defined as one which results in the lander remaining largely intact, able to communicate with the Earth, and which does not prevent its payload from being able to carry out its intended mission.\n\nEvery one of the payloads must be able to work as intended for at least 24 hours following the landing. A payload that does not fulfill this will not resolve this question as **No** if 1) Intuitive Machines does not take responsibility for the failure and 2) any other party takes responsibility.",

On February 26, Intuitive Machines' IM-2 lunar lander is expected to launch on a Falcon 9 rocket, carrying commercial payloads to the Moon's South Pole region. The same day, NASA's PUNCH and SPHEREx missions will be launched into orbit, with PUNCH mapping out the Sun's middle corona and SPHEREx searching for water and carbon dioxide in the Milky Way. SpaceX's eighth Starship flight test is also planned, although the details are still unclear. Additionally, India's ISRO is preparing to test a spacecraft that will eventually fly Indian astronauts into orbit, with an uncrewed demonstration potentially taking place in February. As Elon Musk said, 'Starship, the world's biggest and most powerful rocket, lies at the center of Musk's plans to create a fully reusable spacecraft that could one day take humans to Mars.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 01:02 PM\nSource:[Observer](https://observer.com/2025/02/space-missions-february-2025-nasa-spacex/)\n\n**Video: Blue Ghost captures lunar eclipse in space as Moon disappears behind Earth**\nFirefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost lander has captured a stunning video of Earth eclipsing the Moon while en route to its lunar destination.

This mission could be a crucial step towards a future of interplanetary exploration. The discovery of water on the moon could provide resources for future space missions, including the creation of fuel and the possibility of cultivating in an extraterrestrial environment. Nokia's involvement in the mission highlights the company's initiative in the space sector. The mission, IM-2, aims to explore the lunar south pole, a key area in the search for water. The mission will use Nokia's Micro-Nova technology, which will be equipped with two scientific instruments: a pyrometer and a neutron spectrometer. The mission will also test Nokia's lunar surface communication system, which will establish a network of connectivity on the moon. Thierry E. Klein, president of Bell Labs Solutions Research at Nokia, said, 'It's easy to imagine astronauts exploring the moon in a rover with a Micro-Nova Hopper in the backseat.'

Athena will land about 100 km from the moon's south pole and will feature a small rover, a rocket drone, and a NASA drill to conduct experiments. The lander will also test a 4G cellular signal experiment to develop future communications systems for crewed missions on the moon. According to Intuitive Machines' chief technical officer Tim Crain, the second lander is about 90% identical to the first lander, with changes including modifications to the wiring and testing procedures. Crain said, 'We're going to hop, we're going to rove, and we're going to drill.

However, the landing was only partially successful, as the spacecraft tipped over during landing. Ispace attempted to land on the moon in April last year, but failed due to errors in the calculations. The company is now hoping to use the gravity of the Earth and the moon to land on the moon in May or June.

'Blue Ghost' is a lunar lander developed by Firefly Aerospace, while Resilience is a lunar lander developed by iSpace. 'Blue Ghost' will carry 10 payloads to the moon, including a radiation-resistant computer, a drill to measure lunar surface heat flow, and a satellite receiver to establish a permanent connection with the Earth's GPS network. Resilience will carry 6 payloads and a small lunar rover to analyze and photograph the landing site, as well as conduct an experiment on using microalgae to produce food on the moon. After entering Earth's orbit, 'Blue Ghost' will travel along the Earth's orbit for 25 days before starting its engine and heading to the moon. It is expected to land on the moon's 'Sea of Crises' after 16 days in lunar orbit and conduct its scientific objectives over a period of two weeks. Resilience's journey to the moon will be more 'complex'. It plans to fly by the moon a month after launch, continue into deep space for several months, and then return to the moon's orbit before landing in the 'Cold Sea'. This will be iSpace's second attempt to land on the moon, following its failed attempt with the Hakuto-R lunar lander in 2023. The company has upgraded the hardware and software of Resilience to avoid repeating the same mistakes. Firefly Aerospace is attempting to land on the moon for the first time, and has signed a contract with NASA to participate in the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program.
