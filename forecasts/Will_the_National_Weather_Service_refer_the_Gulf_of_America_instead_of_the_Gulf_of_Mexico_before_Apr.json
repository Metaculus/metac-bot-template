The order, signed on January 20, aimed to 'restore names that honor American greatness', but the agencies involved did not technically violate the order as it gave the Secretary of the Interior a 30-day deadline to review and implement the renaming process. The issue has sparked a dispute with Mexico, whose president jokingly suggested renaming the southern region of the United States as 'Mexican America'. 'This is a tsunami information statement for the U.S. East Coast, Gulf of Mexico states, and eastern Canada,' the National Tsunami Warning Center reported, directly contradicting Trump's order. 'Restoring names that honor American greatness,' states the executive order, which Trump himself found 'beautiful'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 10:27 PM\nSource:[CNN](https://www.cnnchile.com/mundo/despite-donald-trumps-executive-order-u-s-government-agencies-used-the-name-gulf-of-mexico-for-tsunami-alert-information-after-earthquake-in-the-area_20250208/)\n\n**US Agencies Defy Trump's Order, Use 'Gulf of Mexico' Name**\nDespite an executive order from Donald Trump, US agencies used the name 'Gulf of Mexico' in official communications about a tsunami warning in the region.

Trump's order stated, 'Reaffirm the names that honor the greatness of the United States.' However, the USGS and NTWC used the traditional name in their communications, including a tsunami warning for the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast of the US and Canada.

A low-pressure system in the southeast, combined with humidity from the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, will generate rain in several areas. Additionally, the influx of humidity from the Pacific Ocean will cause isolated rain showers in the west and center of the country. Temperatures are expected to be extremely high in some regions, with highs of 40-45\u00b0C in Guerrero and Oaxaca, and lows of -10 to -5\u00b0C with frost in Chihuahua and Durango. A new cold front could bring temperatures down in several areas, and in combination with the subtropical jet stream and a dry line over northern Mexico, it will cause strong winds and isolated rain showers in some regions. It is recommended to stay informed through official SMN channels and take preventive measures according to the region.

National Weather Service meteorologist Sammy Hadi stated, 'Unfortunately for all the cold lovers out there, we do have a ridge of high pressure that's now set up across the Gulf of Mexico and South Florida.' This ridge is blocking cold air from the Midwest, resulting in above-average temperatures and morning fog. Hadi added, 'We're going to see above-average temperatures and morning fog continue for the foreseeable future.' Temperatures are expected to rise, with inland areas potentially reaching the upper 80s and close to 90 by midweek next week.

V\u00e1zquez Roma\u00f1a noted that while the winters are expected to be warmer, 2025 will be an easier year to face in terms of heatwaves, with an estimated six heatwaves in 2024 compared to a lower number in 2025. The SMN highlights that April will be a crucial month, with expected high temperatures, but below those of 2024. However, the temperature anomaly could exceed 5 degrees Celsius above normal. The high temperatures could lead to increased air pollution, particularly in urban areas, and the SMN is working with the INECC to monitor and mitigate the environmental impacts.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 08:56 PM\nSource:[imparcialoaxaca.mx](https://imparcialoaxaca.mx/nacional/cual-sera-el-mes-mas-caluroso-del-2025-esto-dice-el-smn/)\n\n**SMN Forecasts 3-4 Heatwaves for 2025 Dry Season**\nThe National Meteorological Service (SMN) expects 3 to 4 heatwaves to occur during the dry season, which typically runs from March to June. According to Fabi\u00e1n V\u00e1zquez Roma\u00f1a, SMN's general coordinator, the heatwaves are a result of climate change, which has led to warmer winters. 'We expect to see between three and four heatwaves in this dry period... In particular, for the CAMe region, in the last ten years we have seen an increase in the number of heatwaves, many of which have been more prolonged. However, it is unlikely that a similar scenario to last year will be repeated,' V\u00e1zquez Roma\u00f1a explained. April is expected to be the hottest month, with temperatures potentially 5 degrees Celsius above normal. However, these temperatures are not expected to reach the extreme levels seen in 2024. The National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC) warns of increased pollution in the Mexico City metropolitan area due to volatile organic compounds, which are products of everyday use that evaporate easily. INECC is monitoring these compounds to develop strategies to mitigate the trend.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[reporteindigo.com](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/cual-sera-el-mes-mas-caluroso-del-2025-esto-dio-a-conocer-el-servicio-meteorologico-nacional/)\n\n**Yes, really, it's going to be called the Gulf of America**\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) recently used the term 'Gulf of America' in a forecast, which is a result of President Donald Trump's executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico. The change is not yet official policy, but the U.S. Department of Interior is expected to add the term to the database of geographic names soon. Many meteorologists are opposed to the change, with some arguing that it will cause confusion and others questioning the logic behind it. The NWS Employees Association declined to comment on the change, and some private forecasters have already begun using the term 'Gulf' instead.

DeSantis' order stated, 'Whereas, an area of low pressure moving across the Gulf of America, interacting with Arctic air, will bring widespread impactful winter weather to North Florida beginning Tuesday, January 21, 2025...,' Trump's own executive order, 'Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness,' was signed just prior to DeSantis' order, rebranding the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America.'

The reference appeared in an executive order issued by Governor Ron DeSantis on January 20, 2025, declaring a state of emergency due to an unusual winter storm affecting the northern part of the state. According to The Independent, the decision to adopt the new name in an official document occurred even before Trump took formal measures to change the designation at the federal level. The executive order EO 25-13 establishes emergency measures due to a winter system that will bring snow, freezing rain, and temperatures below zero to the Panhandle of Florida from January 21. However, what caught attention was its first clause, in which DeSantis wrote: 'CONSIDERANDO that a low-pressure area moving through the Gulf of America, interacting with Arctic air, will bring a generalized and impactful winter climate to northern Florida from Tuesday, January 21, 2025.' The official document details that snow accumulations of 2.5 to 10 centimeters are expected, with some areas reaching up to 12.5 centimeters in case of intense snowfall. Additionally, a layer of ice of up to 6.3 millimeters is forecast, which could affect roads, bridges, and power grids. The governor ordered the activation of the Florida National Guard, the suspension of state regulations, and the allocation of emergency funds to mitigate the impacts. The name Gulf of Mexico has a long history. According to The Independent, the first documented mention dates back to 1672, when French explorers mapped the region as 'Golphe de Mexique.' In turn, the term comes from the Aztec civilization, whose empire, known as mexica, extended to the coasts of the current gulf. Later, Spanish colonizers called it 'Gulf of New Spain,' before the current name became consolidated. The reference in DeSantis' order came just hours after Trump mentioned his intention to officially change the name in the United States. During his speech, the president stated that the 'Gulf of America' had a 'beautiful sound' and justified his proposal highlighting the economic importance of the region for US trade and maritime industry. The New York Times notes that Trump has yet to issue an executive order to make the change official, but the inclusion of the term in state documents could pressure other government entities to follow suit. The name change is not a unilateral decision. According to experts consulted by The Independent, the designation of seas and oceans is regulated by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), an intergovernmental organization of which both the United States and Mexico are members. Although the US government can modify its internal use in maps and official documents, other countries and international entities are not obligated to adopt the new terminology. To date, the Mexican government has not issued an official response, but the issue could generate diplomatic tensions. The inclusion of the term 'Gulf of America' in DeSantis' order has also sparked criticism within the United States. According to The New York Times, the former first lady and former presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, reacted with an audible laugh when Trump made the announcement in the Capitol. Other analysts consider that the premature use of the term by DeSantis could be a political strategy to strengthen his relationship with the president and his supporters. However, without a federal order, the Gulf of America remains only a reference in a state document, but its inclusion in DeSantis' executive order has already opened the discussion on the scope and implications of the measure. Beyond the controversy, the governor's executive order includes urgent measures to face the impact of the winter storm. Meteorological forecasts indicate the possibility of up to 12.5 centimeters of snow in some areas of the Panhandle, as well as accumulations of ice up to 6.3 millimeters.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 04:06 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/estados-unidos/2025/01/21/para-florida-el-golfo-de-mexico-ya-es-el-golfo-de-america/)\n\n**In line with Trump, Florida governor calls Gulf of Mexico 'Gulf of America'**\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis referred to the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America' in a new executive order, aligning with President Donald Trump's plan to rename the body of water.

However, many people are skeptical about the possibility of changing the internationally recognized name of the Gulf of Mexico, which has been used since 1672.
