Singh said that Trump is 'starting a war' and Canada needs to be 'ready to fight back' to protect Canadian jobs. Trudeau will step aside as prime minister after the Liberal Party picks its new leader on March 9, but Singh said that the government should recall Parliament earlier to pass targeted supports. A Liberal government source said that there is no plan to recall Parliament before March 24. Singh said that the government will be voting against them when they return to Parliament at the end of March and there will be an election in the spring.

Singh said Trump is 'starting a war' and Canada needs to be 'ready to fight back' to protect Canadian jobs. Trudeau has said the government will support workers and businesses if tariffs are imposed, but a Liberal government source said there is no plan to recall Parliament before March 24. Singh said the government should recall Parliament immediately to put in targeted supports for workers. Trudeau will step aside as prime minister after the Liberal Party picks its new leader on March 9. The government has mechanisms to protect workers and businesses, but the exact relief package and its implementation are still unclear. Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said the government is looking at ways to use existing programs to support workers and industries affected by the tariffs. Public Safety Minister David McGuinty said Canada is actively sharing video footage with the U.S. to show its efforts to address border issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 07:24 PM\nSource:[CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/singh-trudeau-tariff-relief-1.7446109)\n\n**Canada Responds to Trump's Tariff Plan with Threat of Strong Countermeasure**\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced that Canada will respond strongly if the US imposes a 25% tariff on Canadian products. Trudeau stated, 'If necessary, we are all ready to give a strong and national response.' Trudeau emphasized that the Canadian government is committed to taking a firm stance on this issue. He noted that economic impacts could be felt across Canada if the US tariff plan is implemented, and that he has been in contact with provincial leaders to discuss the issue. Trudeau also stated, 'If necessary, we are all ready to give a strong and national response.' This move is reminiscent of Canada's response to similar tariffs imposed by Trump in 2018, when they implemented billions of dollars in additional tariffs. Trudeau's comments suggest that Canada may take a similar stance this time around.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 07:07 AM\nSource:[D\u00fcnya](https://www.dunya.com/dunya/donald-trumpin-gumruk-planina-kanadadan-sert-tepki-haberi-762481)\n\n**Trudeau Government Accused of Partisan Nominations to the Judiciary**\nThe Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, has been accused of partisan nominations to the judiciary, despite claims of depoliticization. Between January 2024 and January 2025, Justice Minister Arif Virani appointed 20 judges to the Quebec Superior Court, at least four of whom had previously donated to or supported the Liberal Party of Canada (PLC). This is not a new practice, as 76.3% of judges appointed since the Liberals' 2015 election and who have contributed to a political party have given to the PLC. The Journal found that several other judges had similar ties through Elections Canada data across the country. 'The minister has no knowledge of the candidates' and candidates' donation history when recommending their nomination,' said Virani's assistant in an email to the Journal. However, Professor Patrick Taillon of Laval University argues that the nomination process is 'inevitably' political. 'The problem is not that it's political. The problem is that we pretend it's not. We pretend it only exists in the United States, but no, it also exists in Canada,' he said. Taillon believes that the Trudeau government, like its predecessors, engages in 'court-packing,' an effort to fill vacant judge positions with lawyers known to be from the same ideological family. The Canadian Judicial Council stated that 'participation or absence of participation in political activities should have no impact on whether a person is qualified or not to be a judge.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 05:08 AM\nSource:[Le Journal de Montreal](https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2025/01/30/encore-des-nominations-partisanes-par-les-liberaux-dans-le-systeme-de-justice-quebecois)\n\n**If Mark Carney becomes Canada\u2019s next PM, it will be Trudeau 2.0**\nIf Mark Carney becomes Canada's next Prime Minister, it will be a repeat of Justin Trudeau's leadership, according to the article. Carney, a former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor, has no political experience and has been criticized for his support of environmental policies that could hurt Canada's economy. The article argues that Carney's appointment is a result of Liberal insiders and grassroots supporters handing it to him, rather than facing the electorate. In contrast, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has been leading in the polls for nearly three years and has resonated with Canadians through his conservative principles and efforts to tackle issues like unaffordable housing and high fuel costs. The article concludes that switching Trudeau for Carney will not stop the bleeding and will result in Justin Trudeau 2.0 with the same ineffective leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 06:40 PM\nSource:[telegraph.co.uk](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/29/mark-carney-trudeau-2-point-0-liberal-canada-election/)\n\n**Michael Higgins: A Senate stuffed with Liberal bagmen is Trudeau's gift to Poilievre**\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau plans to fill 10 vacant Senate positions before leaving office on March 9, stacking the upper chamber with Liberal appointees. This move will leave a legacy of partisanship and patronage for the Conservatives, making it difficult for them to govern. Trudeau's actions contradict his 2014 promise to end partisanship and patronage in the Senate, which he described as 'broken' and in need of 'fixing'. Trudeau said at the time that partisanship amplifies the Prime Minister's power and prioritizes party interests over national interests.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 11:04 AM\nSource:[National Post](https://nationalpost.com/opinion/michael-higgins-a-senate-stuffed-with-liberal-bagmen-is-trudeaus-gift-to-poilievre)\n\n**Report: Canada Mulls Massive \u2018Pandemic-Style\u2019 Bailout to Prepare for Trump Tariffs**\nThe Canadian government, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, is allegedly planning a 'pandemic-style' bailout program to protect industries from potential tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. According to the Globe and Mail, the government is planning massive spending to keep Canadian businesses afloat, but this would require parliamentary approval, which is currently suspended until March 24.

Trudeau will remain in office until a new leader is chosen. The move has raised questions about the future of the Liberal Party and the country's critical issues. Trudeau's tenure has been marked by highs and lows, including controversies like the SNC-Lavalin scandal and the WE Charity debacle. Polls have shown declining public confidence in Trudeau's leadership, and analysts speculate that his resignation may be an attempt to rejuvenate the party's image ahead of the next federal election. Supporters argue that his decision demonstrates accountability and a willingness to prioritize the party's future over personal ambition, while critics contend that his resignation comes too late and may alienate Trudeau loyalists. The prorogation of Parliament during the leadership race may slow down legislative progress, but it also presents an opportunity for the country to pause and reconsider its trajectory. The new leader will need to quickly consolidate support within the party and in the House of Commons to avoid triggering an early federal election. For Canada, Trudeau's resignation marks the end of an era and opens the door for a critical re-evaluation of national priorities, including the housing crisis, climate change, Indigenous reconciliation, and strained relations with global powers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[thegatewayonline.ca](https://thegatewayonline.ca/2025/01/trudeaus-resignation-presents-both-problems-and-opportunities/)\n\n**Justin Trudeau's Mixed Record on LGBTQ+ Issues**\nJustin Trudeau's decade-long mandate has seen significant advancements for the LGBTQ+ community in Canada, including the ban on conversion therapies, the end of the blood donation ban for gay men, and the protection of gender identity and expression under the Canadian Human Rights Act. However, challenges persist, and some have expressed disappointment and frustration. 'The sunny roads', Trudeau promised during his election as Prime Minister in 2015. Since then, the MP for Papineau has made numerous appearances at LGBTQ+ events, particularly during Pride marches in many cities. Patrick Desmarais, president of the Emergence Foundation, highlights Trudeau's commitment to the LGBTQ+ community, saying, 'He has been an exemplary ally, contributing to building a more just and equitable society through his concrete actions and inspiring words.' Despite these advancements, the criminalization of HIV remains a persistent issue, with the government announcing in 2022 that it would not pursue legislative reforms. Trudeau had previously promised concrete measures to address this issue, stating, 'The current penal code is too harsh and stigmatizing, discouraging people living with HIV and AIDS from seeking treatment and testing.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 08:14 PM\nSource:[fugues.com](https://www.fugues.com/2025/01/28/les-bons-et-moins-bons-coups-de-justin-trudeau-sur-les-dossiers-lgbtq/)\n\n**Trudeau Steps Down: What Happens Next**\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced his resignation, effective immediately, along with the prorogation of parliament until March 24, 2025. Trudeau cited the need for a 'reset' to address pressing domestic and international challenges. The Liberal Party now has 90 days to elect a new leader, with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney emerging as frontrunners. Trudeau expressed confidence that his successor would continue to champion Canadian values. However, opposition parties have warned of a vote of non-confidence, potentially leading to a federal election as early as spring 2025.

He has been in office for over 9 years, the longest tenure of any G7 leader. Trudeau stated that he decided to resign because he did not want to cause internal conflicts within the party, saying, 'If we need to deal with internal issues, I won't be the best choice for the election.' He will remain as Prime Minister and leader of the Liberal Party until a new leader is chosen. The Canadian general election is scheduled to take place by October 2025.

Trudeau stated, 'Last night, during dinner, I told my children the decision I share with you today. I intend to resign as party leader and prime minister after the party chooses its next leader through a competitive national process.' The Liberal Party is in minority in the Lower House and has been governing since the 2021 general elections with the support of the New Democratic Party (NPD). The opposition has to wait until the Lower House resumes sessions on January 27, when the parliamentary recess ends. Trudeau could opt to extend the recess, delaying the start of sessions, to try to reach an agreement with the NPD or give more time to the Liberal Party to select a new leader. The Liberal Party has been facing polls showing a decline in Trudeau's image among the public due to the high cost of living, lack of affordable housing, and deterioration of public services. The polls also indicate that the Conservative Party would win the next general elections with more than 20 points of advantage over the Liberals, who risk becoming the fourth party in Parliament.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 11:42 PM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2025/1/6/trudeau-renuncia-como-primer-ministro-canadiense-trump-se-adjudica-logro-517118.html)\n\n**Justin Trudeau Announces Resignation as Canadian Prime Minister**\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation on Monday, January 6, 2025.

He was first elected as Prime Minister in 2015 at the age of 43, after leading the Liberal Party to a landslide victory. Trudeau's government implemented progressive policies, including equal representation of men and women in the cabinet and a welcoming approach to refugees. However, the party has faced challenges in recent years, including rising costs and a housing market boom, which have led to a decline in voter support.
