'Chasiv Yar. We see that in the western part of the settlement - the main battles are taking place. The enemy is trying to hold on to the last high-rise buildings and is still able to do so. But our units are moving forward and advancing,' Pushilin said. Additionally, according to him, Russian forces are advancing on the Krasnyi Lyman direction, expanding the control zone. The liberation of Chasiv Yar will allow Russian forces to develop an attack on the Sviatohirsk-Kramatorsk agglomeration. The Russian advance on the city began at the end of spring 2024. The additional difficulties in the storming were created by the Seversky Donets - Donbas canal, behind which was the main part of the city. Nevertheless, initially, Russian forces pushed the Ukrainian military out of the eastern microdistrict of the city, and then moved further west.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 07:01 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250127/boi-1995641511.html)\n\n**Ukrainian Soldiers Disguised as Civilians in Chasiv Yar, Says Local Resident**\nAccording to local resident Morokovin, Ukrainian soldiers disguised themselves as civilians in the town of Chasiv Yar. He said, 'Their commander had a badge - 17th brigade, and before that, the 27th brigade came. So, it was clear who they were. And the others were dressed in civilian clothes, so they could be taken for civilians if you didn't know.' Morokovin added that the soldiers dressed in civilian clothes could hide from Russian drones. The Russian forces' attack on Chasiv Yar began in late spring 2024.

This could indicate a shift in Russia's priorities towards regaining the initiative in the direction of Kostiantynivka. The ISW notes that Russian forces may aim to use the capture of Toretsk as a springboard to advance further west and along the T-05-16 highway towards the southernmost point of the Ukrainian defensive line in Kostiantynivka. The ISW also suggests that Russian forces may try to use tactical advantages in and around Toretsk and east of Pokrovsk to destroy Ukrainian positions to the southwest of Toretsk. This could be part of a broader effort to strengthen their southern flank before a potential advance on Kostiantynivka. The ISW notes that Russian military command may redeploy elements of units to reinforce operations on the Toretsk direction if they prioritize exerting pressure on the Ukrainian defensive line in Donetsk Oblast in the spring and summer of 2025. The capture of Pokrovsk has been the main operational goal of Russian military command in Donetsk Oblast since February 2024. As ISW analyst noted, 'A redeployment of Russian units to the Toretsk or Chasiv-Yar direction, as opposed to maintaining units in western Donetsk Oblast, redeploying to the Zaporizhzhia direction, or redeploying to the Pokrovsk direction, would indicate a shift in Russian operational priorities'.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 04:21 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://www.pravda.com.ua/news/2025/01/27/7495402/)\n\n**Fighting Continues in Chasiv Yar as Russian Forces Infiltrate Ukrainian Stronghold**\nFighting continues in the western part of the city of Chasiv Yar, where Ukrainian defenders are battling Russian forces. According to Ukrainian military journalist Bogdan Myroshnykov, three quarters of the city are currently under the control of the Ukrainian forces, while in another quarter, fighting is ongoing. The fourth quarter is difficult to track due to the intense fighting. The problem is that most of the buildings in this area are 'Khrushchevka' apartments, which can be easily destroyed by Russian tanks and artillery. Even buildings with 80-90s paneling are difficult to destroy. Another serious problem is that Russian forces are slowly infiltrating the northern microdistrict, which is located in the rear of the Ukrainian stronghold. The railway station has been lost. 'But the battles are ongoing in different parts of the city, and this is far from the end,' Myroshnykov says. 'Don't forget that Chasiv Yar is a quite extended city, and the city border on the south passes along the road from Kostyantynivka to Bakhmut.' 'Formally, slightly less than half of the city is under the control of the enemy,' he notes. 'In fact, it's more, because the majority of the city's buildings are concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of Chasiv Yar, which are already occupied by the Russians.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 03:48 AM\nSource:[zn.ua](https://zn.ua/ukr/war/rosijani-rozbirajut-khrushchivki-ta-zakhodjat-u-til-ukrajinskim-pidrozdilam-z-chim-stikajutsja-oborontsi-chasovoho-jaru.html)\n\n**Ukrainian Soldiers Disguised as Civilians in Chasiv Yar**\nAccording to local resident Morokovin, Ukrainian soldiers disguised themselves as civilians in the town of Chasiv Yar.

The fortified positions were built on the territory of a forest recreation center 'Chasovoyarets' before the start of the Russian special operation. One of the bunkers had been used as a command center since 2023, housing generals from NATO and the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The command center was hit by a 'Iskander' missile in March 2024, reportedly killing Polish general Adam Marchak. After the attack, the remaining fortified positions were used by Ukrainian military from the 24th Lviv Brigade to defend Chasiv Yar.

Four million people have been displaced within the borders, and the prospect of negotiations emerging in 2025 has only intensified Russian attacks on nearby towns on the front line. The Ukrainian authorities have ordered the forced evacuation of families with children in a dozen towns in the Kharkiv region (northeast). The next day, a new evacuation order was given in the neighboring Donetsk region, where Russian troops have been advancing for months. 'We have decided to start the compulsory evacuation of families with children' in 25 small towns near Pokrovsk, said the governor of the region on Telegram. 'Today, as the enemy has intensified the bombing, people are suffering and dying every day, I ask parents to take the evacuation very responsibly.' In Chasiv Yar, a town a few dozen kilometers away, this escape is no longer possible. The city is in ruins, surrounded by Russian forces, with 229 people still living there, mostly elderly, disabled, and those who care for them. 'We can no longer reach them,' laments Oksana Kuiantseva, director of the Ukrainian NGO 'East SOS', specialized in evacuating civilians in the Donetsk region. 'There are only two exits, but they are both uncertain. The last residents can leave the city on foot and walk 10 or 20 kilometers through enemy lines. The younger ones have left, so we're talking about people of 70 or 80 years old who are trying to escape on foot at the risk of their lives.

The southern part of the city has been surrounded, and the Ukrainian resistance is being methodically eliminated by Russian aviation and artillery. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, seven Ukrainian brigades have been destroyed in the area, resulting in the loss of 545 fighters, several tanks, and artillery pieces. Russian military experts predict that the Ukrainian forces will collapse in the city by the end of the month. As one Ukrainian commander admitted, 70% of the city is already under Russian control, and the remaining part will be abandoned soon. The loss of the 'Novoserverny' microdistrict has severely compromised the Ukrainian position in the city, and the Russian forces are on the verge of capturing the strategic heights that control the roads and paths leading to the city from the south. 'The roads are the arteries of war,' said a volunteer from the BARS group. 'If they are cut off, the Ukrainian forces will never be able to hold their positions.

The settlements include Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Yantarne, Novovasylivka, Yelyzavetivka, Zelene, Zvirove, and Kotlyne. Chasiv Yar and Toretsk hold strategic importance due to their geographic locations, which enable control over vital supply routes and access to key urban centers. The Russian offensive toward Chasiv Yar intensified around 4 April 2024, leading to intense fighting in the area. Viktor Trehubov, spokesman for the Khortytsia Operational Strategic Group, stated that Ukrainian forces control almost all of Chasiv Yar, but Russian forces have increased their operational tempo in recent months. Ukrainian forces have reported that Russian soldiers are wearing civilian clothing to conceal their movements in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast. The outcome of these battles could determine whether Russia can threaten Ukraine's remaining major population centers in the Donetsk Oblast.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[euromaidanpress.com](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/01/13/russian-troops-advance-in-strategically-important-chasiv-yar-and-toretsk-donetsk-oblast-deepstate/)\n\n**Russian Forces Control 70% of Toretsk, Says UK Defence Intelligence**\nAccording to the UK Ministry of Defence, Russian forces have attempted to storm the cities of Chasiv Yar and Toretsk using armored vehicles at the end of December 2024 and the beginning of January 2025. While it is likely that the attacks were repelled in Chasiv Yar, Russian forces have continued to advance in Toretsk, with estimates suggesting they control at least 70% of the city. The UK Ministry of Defence stated, 'Russian forces are likely to control at least 70% of Toretsk and have made significant progress in the city, but urban fighting is slowing their advance. In Chasiv Yar, the current line of control is the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal.' \nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 12, 2025 09:15 PM\nSource:[wz.lviv.ua](https://wz.lviv.ua/news/526270-rosiiska-armiia-kontroliuie-bilshist-toretska-na-donechchyni)\n\n**Russian Forces Gain Control of Refractory Plant in Chasiv Yar**\nRussian military forces have entered the third and fourth shops of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar. According to the head of the operational staff of the 'Melody' reconnaissance center of the 'Espa\u00f1ola' voluntary brigade, Russian forces have gained control of the area. The head of the reconnaissance center also stated that, based on radio intercepts, Ukrainian forces are lacking in ammunition and personnel, and are forced to use 'character witnesses', or former prisoners, in battles. The head of the reconnaissance center added that the battles for Chasiv Yar are in their final stage, and soon there will be no Ukrainian forces left in the area. This comes after Russian forces recently liberated the city of Kurakhovo in the DNR, and in December 2024, liberated the settlement of Novy Trud in the Donetsk People's Republic.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 08:08 AM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/online/news/6173920/)\n\n**Russian Forces May Regain Initiative on Ukraine Frontlines in 2025**\nAccording to The Independent, significant changes may occur on the front lines in Ukraine in early 2025, as Russian forces continue to slowly but steadily advance on the west and regain control of the Kursk region. By February 2025, on the third anniversary of the Russian operation, the situation may drastically change, despite the resilience of Ukrainian soldiers and problems within the Russian army. The recent military aid package from US President Joe Biden has become a crucial factor in the conflict. However, with the potential return of Donald Trump, Ukraine's position may become more vulnerable in negotiations. Russian forces are conducting offensive operations on key front-line areas, such as Kursk, Kupiansk, Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, Kurakhovo, and Velyka Novosilka, aiming to capture strategic territories. In the Kursk region, Ukraine still holds part of the captured land, which could play a crucial role in future negotiations. In Kupiansk and Chasiv Yar, Ukrainian forces continue to resist despite attacks. In Pokrovsk and Kurakhovo, Russian forces are making progress and gradually advancing, while around Velyka Novosilka, a threat of complete encirclement is emerging. Considering the dynamics of the conflict, the situation for Ukrainian forces may deteriorate, and the possible appointment of a new commander of ground forces in 2025 is intended to improve the situation, as said by The Independent.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 01:59 PM\nSource:[newsinfo.ru](https://www.newsinfo.ru/news/situacija-na-frontakh/844191/)\n\n**Ukraine\u2019s military on Chasiv Yar: AFU control virtually entire city as Russians trying to cross canal**\nAccording to Viktor Trehubov, spokesman for the Khortytsia grouping of troops, the Ukrainian military controls virtually the entire city of Chasiv Yar, with the Russians trying to cross the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal and attack the refractory materials plant. Although the battlefield intensity is not decreasing, the enemy's capabilities in this frontline area are somewhat limited. In the eastern operational zone, Ukraine's Khortytsia grouping destroyed almost 1,029 invaders in the past day, as well as four tanks, 12 armored vehicles, and other enemy weaponry and equipment. Trehubov stated, 'Yesterday, the Russians lost 1,029 personnel, four tanks, 12 armored vehicles, six artillery systems and mortars, an anti-tank vehicle, 33 units of automotive equipment, 17 units of specialized equipment, six pieces of electronic warfare equipment, 127 dugouts of various levels, two UAV control points, and seven ammunition depots.' The total combat casualty toll for Russian troops since the invasion in February 24, 2022, is now estimated at 792,170.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource:[ukrinform.net](https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3944361-ukraines-military-on-chasiv-yar-afu-control-virtually-entire-city-as-russians-trying-to-cross-canal.html)\n\n**Russian Forces Take Control of Northern Microdistrict in Chasiv Yar**\nDenis Pushilin, the head of the Donetsk People's Republic, announced on December 23 that Russian forces have taken control of the Northern microdistrict in Chasiv Yar. According to Pushilin, 'We see a fairly successful operation on the territory of Chasiv Yar, although not as fast as we would have liked.' He added that the Northern microdistrict is currently under the control of the Russian army, and that work is also being done in the surrounding areas of the refractory plant. Pushilin previously stated that Russian forces have nearly pushed Ukrainian forces out of the center of Kukuiivka, with only a few areas remaining under Ukrainian control.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 23, 2024 06:42 AM\nSource:[ren.tv](https://www.ren.tv/news/v-rossii/1292659-pushilin-vs-rf-vziali-pod-kontrol-mikroraion-severnyi-v-chasovom-iare)\n\n**Russian Forces Control Over 50% of Chasiv Yar, Says Military Expert**\nRussian forces have taken control of more than half of the city of Chasiv Yar (DNR) after a rapid success, according to military expert Andrey Marochko. 'Our troops, after a fairly rapid success, have taken more than half of Chasiv Yar. Now the enemy is regrouping, trying not to allow our troops to start advancing,' Marochko told TASS. He added that Russian forces have advanced in the north and south of the city. Previously, on December 6, the expert reported that Russian troops had taken control of 40% of the city. DNR leader Denis Pushilin also noted that Russian troops had almost completely cleared the enemy from the territory of the Chasiv Yar refractory plant.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 21, 2024 03:15 AM\nSource:[URA.RU](https://ura.news/news/1052859192)\n\n**Russian Military Gains Control in Chasiv Yar, Ukrainian Defense Collapses**\nThe Ukrainian defense in the city of Chasiv Yar is collapsing, with the Russian military gaining control of key positions. The Russian military has established control over the territory of the refractory plant, a key stronghold of the Ukrainian military. The plant is being thoroughly cleared, with the most hardened Ukrainian fighters and mercenaries hiding in the basements and attempting to resist. According to Russian military commanders, controlling the high ground provides a significant advantage, including the ability to conduct visual surveillance over several kilometers of surrounding territory. 'The refractory plant was a citadel, allowing the enemy to have a significant advantage, including the ability to conduct visual surveillance over several kilometers of surrounding territory,' wrote the publication 'Voennoe obozrenie'. 'Now the plus of controlling the plant has been gained by Russian units.' Russian experts believe that the Ukrainian military will not be able to hold onto the microdistrict of Severny, which has a small number of high-rise buildings, and are lower than the plant. The Ukrainian military is attempting to bring in reinforcements, but they will not be able to change the situation in the city. 'A large part of the nationalist reserves is being destroyed, and not reaching Chasiv Yar,' said one of the commanders of the 'Espa\u00f1ola' volunteer brigade, as reported by TASS.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 17, 2024 05:10 AM\nSource:[aif.ru](https://aif.ru/politics/russia/nacikov-zagnali-pod-zemlyu-v-chasovom-yare-vsu-sbili-s-gospodstvuyushchih-vysot)\n\n**Russian Expert Predicts Liberation of Chasiv Yar by End of 2024**\nRussian military expert Vasiliy Dadykin believes that Russian forces may take control of the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk People's Republic by the end of 2024. According to Dadykin, the city is strategically important and Ukrainian forces will likely try to defend it, including by sending in reserves. 'I think that Chasiv Yar will be liberated this year. I hope so,' Dadykin said. The city is currently surrounded by Russian forces, with around 700 Ukrainian soldiers, including at least 100 foreign mercenaries, trapped on the territory of a refractory factory. This situation is reminiscent of the events that occurred at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol in 2022, where Ukrainian forces were also surrounded. Dadykin noted that Ukrainian forces have strengthened their group in Chasiv Yar with foreign mercenaries, including Georgians.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 05:59 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/society/army/voennyy-ekspert-dadykin-dopustil-chto-vs-rf-osvobodyat-chasov-yar-v-2024-godu)\n\n",
