Trump stated, 'We are on time with the tariffs and it seems like that is moving along very rapidly.' He also claimed, 'We have been treated very badly and it is not just Canada and Mexico. We have been taken advantage of.' Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has threatened to retaliate with dollar-for-dollar tariffs if the U.S. imposes the tariffs.

According to a source, Trump did not mockingly refer to Trudeau as the governor of the 51st US state, as he had done on social media before the game. The Canadian team won the tournament final 3-2 in overtime on February 21. Trump has previously expressed the opinion that many Canadians support the idea of Canada becoming the 51st US state, which he believes would bring economic stability and protection from external threats, including Russia and China. However, Trudeau has stated that Canada will never become the 51st US state. 'He did not make the comment with a mocking tone, as he had done before the game,' said the source. 'It was a more serious conversation,' added the source. 'The two leaders discussed a range of topics, including the Four Nations Tournament and other issues of mutual interest.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 07:11 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/23223777)\n\n**Javier Milei Prepares for Opening Speech of Congress Sessions**\nPresident Javier Milei is preparing to deliver his opening speech for the ordinary sessions of Congress on March 1st.

This statement, recorded in an official White House press release, occurred during a discussion about the conflict in Ukraine and global security challenges. Trudeau and Trump spoke by phone on Saturday, with the Republican president expressing his conviction that the war in Ukraine would not have started if he were in power, a view that Trudeau supported. According to the White House, 'The Prime Minister Trudeau echoed the President Trump's desire to see the end of the war and recognized that he is the only world leader who can promote a just and lasting peace.' Beyond the issue of Ukraine, the conversation also addressed the issue of fentanyl trafficking, a key topic for Trump's agenda. Trudeau reported that Canada has reduced the flow of fentanyl to the US by 90% and announced that his government will continue to collaborate with Washington on border security. The dialogue between the two leaders takes place in a context of commercial and political tensions, exacerbated by previous Trump statements about the possibility of imposing tariffs on Canada or even considering its annexation as the 51st state of the US. Despite these differences, Trudeau seemed to seek common ground with the Republican in a moment when the US political landscape could change dramatically in the coming months.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[eldiariony.com](https://eldiariony.com/2025/02/22/justin-trudeau-dijo-que-trump-es-el-unico-lider-que-puede-impulsar-la-paz-justa-y-duradera/)\n\n**Trudeau Mocks Trump After Canada's Hockey Win**\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau mocked US President Donald Trump after Canada's hockey team won the final match of the 'Four Nations' tournament.

Trump also sarcastically referred to Trudeau as the 'Governor of Canada' and invited him to join the US team, saying, 'If Governor Trudeau wants to join us, he'll be welcomed with open arms.
