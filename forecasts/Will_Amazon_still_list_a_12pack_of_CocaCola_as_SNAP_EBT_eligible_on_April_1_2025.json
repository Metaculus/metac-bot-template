According to Arne Koslowski, a Coca-Cola manager, the new size aims to fill the gap between the half-liter and family-sized bottles, targeting smaller households and singles. This move will bring the total number of packaging variants offered by Coca-Cola in Germany to 318.

According to the company, this new size is designed to target consumers in smaller households and fills a gap in their product range. The number of single and small households has been increasing for years, and the trend towards smaller packaging sizes for refreshing drinks is also continuing. Arne Koslowski, Vice President Commercial Development at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners Deutschland (CCEP DE), explains, 'We see a trend towards smaller packaging sizes for carbonated refreshing drinks.' The new packaging is the first addition to the large PET disposable bottles over 0.5 liters in 17 years. The 0.85-liter bottle will be available for the brands Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Sprite, and Mezzo Mix. The new bottle will be filled at the company's production sites in Dorsten/North Rhine-Westphalia, Genshagen/Brandenburg, and Knetzgau/Bavaria. According to Coca-Cola, the unbinding recommended price for the new 0.85-liter bottle will be significantly lower than that of the 1-liter disposable bottle.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:19 PM\nSource:[SOL.DE - Saarland Online](https://www.sol.de/deutschland-und-welt/neue-flaschengroesse-coca-cola-ueberrascht-mit-ungewoehnlichem-format,577031.html)\n\n**Coca-Cola Introduces New 0.85-Liter Flasche in Germany**\nCoca-Cola will introduce a new 0.85-liter Pet-flasche in Germany, available starting in April.

According to the company, this is the first new Pet-Einwegpfandflasche with more than 0.5 liters of content in 17 years.

The group's goal is to 'remind them who has the power,' as Schwarz said. The boycotts include a 'Amazon Blackout' from March 7 to 14, which includes avoiding Amazon-owned entities such as Whole Foods Market and Twitch. Additionally, civil rights activists in Minnesota are boycotting Target due to its decision to phase out DEI initiatives, and the Latino Freeze Movement is urging the Latino community to be 'selective' in where they shop and support businesses that align with their values. The movement has named over a dozen companies to avoid, including Coca-Cola and Amazon.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 09:56 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/more-economic-blackouts-planned-next-095637121.html)\n\n**I Tried the Spindrift Soda, and It's Not What I Was Expecting**\nThe author, a huge fan of soda, was disappointed with Spindrift's new line of soda, which features real fruit and no added sugar. The author tried all five flavors, including Strawberry Shortcake, Concord Freeze, Orange Cream Float, Shirley Temple, and Ginger Ale, but found them to be unimpressive and lacking in flavor. The author notes that the 'sodas' have a tangy, kombucha-like taste and are not what most people think of as soda. The author recommends choosing Spindrift sparkling water instead, which has a similar flavor profile but without the disappointment. The Spindrift soda line is currently only available on the Spindrift website, Amazon, and select retailers, with a 12-pack of one single flavor costing $26.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 12:08 AM\nSource:[Taste of Home](https://www.tasteofhome.com/article/spindrift-soda-review/)\n\n**Coca-Cola Introduces New 0.85-Liter Bottle Size**\nCoca-Cola will introduce a new 0.85-liter bottle size for its popular brands, including Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta, Sprite, and Mezzo Mix, starting in April. This move aims to fill the gap between half-liter and family-sized bottles. According to Arne Koslowski, sales manager, 'We see a trend towards smaller packaging sizes for carbonated beverages.' The company is responding to changing drinking habits, where smaller households may not finish a large bottle of soda quickly, leading to a loss of fizz and flavor. As of now, Coca-Cola offers 318 different packaging options in Germany, including PET single-use and multi-use, glass bottles, and cans. The new bottle size will be produced at the company's facilities in Dorsten, Genshagen, and Knetzgau, where machines and equipment have been upgraded to accommodate the new size. Coca-Cola invested 1.5 million euros in this upgrade.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 07:06 PM\nSource:[Bild](https://www.bild.de/leben-wissen/verbrauchertipps/neue-flaschengroesse-bei-coca-cola-ab-april-67c880caf0c49c5db2140930)\n\n**Amazon Sellers Should Check the Status of Their 3P Service Providers**\nAmazon is requiring third-party service providers to register on the Solution Provider Portal (SPP) by the end of August. If they haven't registered by April 10, 2025, their access to Seller Central accounts will be suspended. According to Amazon documentation, sellers must list third-party providers as 'authorized partners' by April 10, 2025, to avoid losing access to their accounts. Some service providers are warning sellers to ensure their providers are compliant, as failure to do so may result in a 'nightmare' on April 10.
