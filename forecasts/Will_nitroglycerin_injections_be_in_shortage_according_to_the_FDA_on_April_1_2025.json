The vaccine was approved by the FDA and will be shipped by the Serum Institute of India (SII) starting February 19, 2025. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, Founder of ImmunityBio, said, 'With the increasing threat of supply shortages of essential medicines, the biopharmaceutical industry must innovate and secure new means of ensuring uninterrupted access to vital therapeutics.' The rBCG vaccine has demonstrated potent immunogenicity and improved safety compared to earlier BCG strains and formulations. ImmunityBio's ANKTIVA, a cytokine interleukin-15, plays a crucial role in the immune system and integrates with rBCG vaccinations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[precisionvaccinations.com](https://www.vax-before-travel.com/bcg-vaccine-shortage-ends-united-states-2025-02-19)\n\n**ImmunityBio (IBRX): FDA Authorizes ImmunityBio to Provide Recombinant BCG (rBCG) to Urologists to Address TICE\u00ae BCG Shortage**\nThe U.S. FDA has authorized an expanded access program for ImmunityBio to provide a recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine to urologists to address the shortage of TICE BCG in the U.S. The shortage has hindered the treatment of bladder cancer patients, with 57% of urologists surveyed unable to treat patients in the last 12 months due to lack of access to TICE BCG. The rBCG vaccine, developed by the Serum Institute of India, has shown potent immunogenicity and improved safety in European bladder cancer clinical trials.

Although not as widespread as in January, the problem persists. The Ministry of Health attributes the situation to the 'one-time' approach of beneficiaries in submitting prescriptions for 2024 and 2025. However, people wonder if the region's budget, which has reduced spending (e.g., by eliminating the subsidy for transportation for students), is connected to the shortage. The Ministry of Health responded that the number of people receiving subsidized medications has increased from 153,333 in 2023 to 167,580 in 2024, and 170,000 in 2025. The total cost of dispensing medications has also increased, from 4.37 billion rubles in 2024 to the same amount in 2025, despite a 2.5% increase in the number of beneficiaries and an 11% increase in medication prices. The Ministry has promised to deliver medications to patients' homes, including those with chronic illnesses, the elderly, and those living in remote areas. However, four medications are currently unavailable: clopicxol and methylprednisolone tablets, Humalog insulin, and Ionsoteryl infusion solution. Patients are advised to consult their doctors to find alternative treatments. The problem of medication shortages has been reported in many regions, with some even conducting investigations. In Kuzbass, the prosecutor's office has received complaints from citizens and has taken measures to ensure that patients receive necessary medications and are reimbursed for any costs incurred in purchasing medications themselves.

Clark explained that the biannual purchase of medicines has already been made, and the first deliveries will begin on March 5, with a visible impact between March 15 and 23. Clark emphasized that the supply of essential medicines, such as cancer treatments, diabetes, and hypertension medications, will begin to normalize during this period. Clark attributed the shortage to the change in government, which forced an emergency purchase and a consolidated purchase in record time. Clark stated that in the coming years, efforts will be made to avoid these gaps between medication purchase contracts to ensure a continuous supply. Clark emphasized that the Ministry of Health is working intensively to ensure that patients receive their treatments as soon as possible. Clark stated that 95% of the medicine keys have already been awarded, and their distribution will begin in March, allowing for an improvement in the supply of medicines in hospitals and clinics across the country.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 01:07 AM\nSource:[diariodelyaqui.mx](https://diariodelyaqui.mx/nacional/abasto-de-medicamentos-mejorara-a-partir-del-15-de-marzo-eduardo-clark/102020)\n\n**CMCH faces growth hormone injection shortage; patients affected | Coimbatore News - The Times of India**\nCoimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) and Tirupur government hospital are facing a shortage of growth hormone injections, affecting over 50 patients. The injections are prescribed to children with genetic growth hormone defects and Turner syndrome. CMCH dean Dr A Nirmala said, 'Earlier, National Health Mission (NHM) had supplied these injections. But now there is a supply shortage in the market. Hence, we are in the process of looking out for new vendors who could supply these injections.' Dr V Shobi Anandi, paediatric endocrinologist at a private hospital, warned that a short break in dosages could create a significant impact on growth, and that the injections are administered daily for a period of minimum two years and beyond. A parent of a Tirupur patient petitioned the collector, saying that her daughter's growth could be impacted by 2 or 3 cm if the injections are stopped.

Sheinbaum assured that, starting from March, all medications will be guaranteed. According to her, a significant purchase was made for the next two years to resupply the shortage caused by the end of certain contracts with pharmaceutical companies in late 2024. The president mentioned that all medications will be free and not only cover basic diseases, but also more complex ones, including medical interventions. Sheinbaum emphasized that 'all insumos (medications and supplies) will be free and accessible to everyone' in the public healthcare system.

The company's financial data shows that its 2024 performance is impressive, with a predicted net profit of 3565-5124 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 132-233%. The main reason for the growth is the arrival of industry support funds in 2023 and the reduction in goodwill impairment losses. Easun Pharmaceutical's products include self-produced medications such as miglustat tablets (Otanping), multiple panthenol tablets (Vidynilin), montmorillonite powder (Beiyiping), and acetylsalicylic acid enteric-coated tablets (Weipufen), as well as products developed in collaboration with third parties, such as gua lucum skin injection (Xintong), cabergoline injection (Xinuosu), and sodium nifedipine injection (Yimeifen), covering multiple treatment areas including diabetes, gastrointestinal diseases, gynecological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, postpartum hemorrhage, and poisoning treatment.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 02:27 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202502183321996456.html)\n\n**Roszdravnadzor Recommends Alternative Therapy for Patients Taking 'Atento'**\nThe Roszdravnadzor (Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare) in the Sverdlovsk region recommends that patients taking the medication 'Atento' find an alternative therapy with the help of a doctor.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that enabling the FDA to more readily authorize the importation of critical generic drugs from well-regulated foreign markets could help prevent and resolve shortages. The study found that for two-thirds of generic sterile injectable drugs in shortage between 2021 and 2024, at least one manufacturer developed a version approved for distribution in at least one of six well-regulated peer countries, but not in the United States. According to the study, 125 sterile injectables appeared on the FDA shortage list between 2021 and 2024, 81 were produced by three or fewer U.S. manufacturers, and 53 had at least one approved version available in other well-regulated markets. The FDA already has protocols in place for risk-based assessment of importation candidates and the quality and safety of the relevant manufacturing facilities. However, the agency pursues importation only after exhausting every other option for boosting supplies, and the study authors argue that this approach should be reconsidered to alleviate the risks of critical medicine shortages.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[thinkglobalhealth.org](https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/importing-generic-drugs-could-ease-us-shortages)\n\n**6 drugs now in shortage**\nAccording to the FDA and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, six new drug shortages have been reported.

However, the less expensive versions of the medication, known as tirz\u00e9patide composite, may be restricted in 2025. This could lead to higher costs and reduced access for patients. The FDA has stated that the tirz\u00e9patide composite versions will no longer be allowed without an official shortage. 'People are worried. They say, 'This has changed my life, but I don't have $1,000 to pay out of pocket and my insurance won't cover it,'' said Ted Kyle, a healthcare professional with decades of experience in policy, marketing, and obesity care. Eli Lilly has not immediately responded to Business Insider's request for comment. Most tirz\u00e9patide composite versions will not be authorized without an official shortage. The FDA's announcement on December 19 aimed to officially remove tirz\u00e9patide from the list of products in shortage, meaning pharmacies will no longer be able to manufacture what is essentially a copy of the branded version. These copies use the same active ingredient \u2013 in this case, tirz\u00e9patide \u2013 but are not FDA-approved, although manufacturers are required to follow other regulatory standards. State-licensed pharmacies will continue to prepare composite versions, operating according to FDA guidelines to allow patients to access life-changing medications during this period where manufacturers cannot. 'The medications they advertise are not yet available in sufficient quantities to meet demand. In the meantime, state-licensed pharmacies will continue to compound copies, operating according to FDA directives to enable patients to access medications that change lives during this period where manufacturers cannot,' wrote Scott Brunner, CEO of the industrial group Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding, in a LinkedIn statement. The FDA had already decided to end the shortage in October, but delayed its decision after a pharmaceutical compounding industry organization filed a lawsuit, alleging it had not given sufficient notice. An update on this case is expected in early January 2025. In the current state of affairs, the FDA's decision will give tirz\u00e9patide composite manufacturers up to 90 days before its application to 'avoid any unnecessary disruption of patient treatment,' according to the announcement. Companies are racing to adapt. The FDA's decision also raises questions for the booming telehealth sector that connects patients to weight loss medications, as companies like Henry Meds and Hims offer GLP-1 composites \u2013 some have removed tirz\u00e9patide composite from their websites. Related stories For now, companies can still offer cheaper weight loss medications, as semaglutide, better known as Wegovy and Ozempic, is still considered in shortage. In some cases, telehealth companies decide to partner with pharmaceutical companies. Earlier in December, telehealth company Ro announced a partnership with Eli Lilly to offer a half-price version of Zepbound, Lilly's branded tirzepatide product. The least expensive option is sold in vials to avoid supply chain problems with pre-filled syringes and to compete with compounded medications. Other branded GLP-1 medications are on the horizon. Other FDA news may continue to modify the trajectory of GLP-1 medications in the months to come. The FDA also announced on December 24 the approval of the first generic version of a daily GLP-1 injection for type 2 diabetes. It could open the door to similar generic medications, including those for weight loss. And other GLP-1 branded medications are in preparation as biotech startups and pharmaceutical companies rush to find the next successful medication. For now, access to weight loss medications is out of reach for many people who could benefit from them. 'This is going to be a continued tension for years to come,' said Kyle. 'Maybe the capitalization will disappear, but the problem won't disappear because the prices don't match the scope of the needs.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 24, 2024 10:20 PM\nSource:[citizenside.fr](https://www.citizenside.fr/fda-penurie-tirzepatide-medicament-amaigrissant-zepbound-terminee/)\n\n**The shortage of popular weight loss drug tirzepatide is over, FDA says.

Dr. Melanie Jay, a professor at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, says that patients should reach out to their doctor to discuss alternative options, which may include switching to brand name versions of these drugs or considering other types of medication.

Companies like Hospira, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, and Fresenius Kabi are affected, and some shortages are expected to resolve by the end of 2024 or in early 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2024 05:55 PM\nSource:[Hospital Review](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/pharmacy/7-drugs-now-in-shortage-2.html)\n\n**FDA Says Shortage of GLP-1 Tirzepatide Is Over**\nThe US FDA has re-issued a decision that the shortage of tirzepatide, a medication for diabetes and weight loss, is over. Tirzepatide includes the blockbuster injected GLP-1 medications Mounjaro and Zepbound. The FDA initially announced that the shortage was over in October, but was forced to re-evaluate after a lawsuit by the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA). The FDA has now effectively put an end to compounding pharmacies producing their own versions of Zepbound/Mounjaro, with a 60-day or 90-day deadline depending on the type of pharmacy. Eli Lilly, the maker of Zepbound and Mounjaro, had pushed back against the OFA's assertion that shortages were still in place, calling compounded versions 'untested, unapproved knockoffs'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[pulmonologyadvisor.com](https://www.pulmonologyadvisor.com/news/fda-says-shortage-of-glp-1-tirzepatide-is-over/)\n\n",
