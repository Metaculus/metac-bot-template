As the US typically borrows to pay prior obligations, reaching the debt limit also limits the ability of the Treasury to fulfill debt obligations, risking default. When the debt limit is reached the Treasury will typically undertake [extraordinary measures](https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#what_are_extraordinary_measures) to avoid default as long as possible.\n\nThe debt ceiling was last suspended in June 2023, but the suspension [expired in January 2025](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/business/debt-ceiling-limit-congress/index.html). On January 17, outgoing Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen [notified Congress](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2798) that the Treasury had begun taking extraordinary measures to avoid default, including implementing a \"debt issuance suspension period\" on certain funds the government typically invests. This suspension period was specified to persist through March 14, 2025.\n\n[According to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation](https://www.pgpf.org/article/the-debt-ceiling-will-be-reinstated-on-january-1-heres-whats-at-stake/):\n\n> The extraordinary measures and cash balance typically can last up to a few months. Most recently, extraordinary measures enabled the government to continue meeting its obligations from January 2023 until lawmakers suspended the debt ceiling in June 2023 as part of the\u00a0[Fiscal Responsibility Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/3746).\n> \u00a0\n> If the available options are exhausted prior to legislation being enacted to adjust the debt ceiling, the United States would default on its debt.\n\nThe brinkmanship involved in the 2023 debt ceiling suspension was a contributing factor to the US' credit rating being [downgraded](https://www.pgpf.org/article/moodys-lowers-us-credit-rating-to-negative-citing-large-federal-deficits/) by two credit agencies, Fitch and Moody's, later in 2023.\n\nReaching an agreement to raise or suspend the debt ceiling [could be difficult](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-ponders-raise-debt-ceiling-dozens-members-ve-always-held-rcna188824) for President Trump and Congress due to the Republicans' thin majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nFor additional resources, see a [tracker of the historical debt limit and debt subject to limit](https://www.ryanbeckauthor.com/forecasting/DebtLimit.html) and the Congressional Research Service report [*Debt Limit Policy Questions: How Long Do Extraordinary Measures Last?*](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12147)",

This has raised concerns about its implications on financial markets, interest rates, and economic stability. The rapid accumulation of debt has been driven by historically high levels of deficit spending, with a $13 trillion increase since 2020, averaging $2.6 trillion annually over the past five years. The federal deficit for 2024 is $1.8 trillion, equivalent to 6.4% of GDP, and interest payments on the debt have increased to over $1 trillion annually. The situation is alarming, with 70% of the maturing debt, or $6.5 trillion, due between January and June 2025, putting significant pressure on bond markets. The government will be forced to issue a large amount of new bonds to meet these maturities, increasing the supply of Treasury bonds and potentially driving up yields. The market has already shown signs of tension, with real yields increasing steadily since 2022. The 10-year Treasury yield has risen 115 basis points since the start of rate cuts, reflecting investors' growing concern about the government's increasing debt. As The Kobeissi Letter noted on February 4, 'the problem of US debt is not new, but the magnitude of the refinancing challenge in 2025 makes it a topic that investors cannot ignore.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[bitfinanzas.com](https://bitfinanzas.com/la-deuda-de-ee-uu-de-92-billones-de-dolares-vencera-en-2025/)\n\n**US Treasury Releases First Debt Financing Plan Under Deese, Maintains Yellen's Policy Language**\nUS Treasury Secretary Brian Deese has released the country's first debt financing plan since taking office, despite his previous criticism of Janet Yellen's debt strategy. The plan maintains the same debt structure and pace as Yellen's, which has eased concerns in the US debt market. As of the release, yields on various US debt terms have fallen, with the 10-year Treasury yield dropping nearly 8 basis points to 4.43%, a new low since December last year. This decline in yields means bond prices have risen. The US dollar has weakened, and COMEX gold has continued to rise 1%, pushing its historical high to $2900 per ounce. The US Treasury has announced that it will auction off $1.25 trillion in debt next week to pay off $1.06 trillion in maturing debt, with specific terms including: $580 billion in 3-year notes due on February 15, 2028; $420 billion in 10-year notes due on February 15, 2035; and $250 billion in 30-year notes due on February 15, 2055. The most notable phrase in the Treasury's statement is the continued mention of 'expecting to continue to maintain nominal coupon and floating rate note auction sizes in the coming quarters.' This phrase has been present since the US increased its debt auction size in early 2024, but was previously criticized by Deese and some Republicans as a way to artificially lower long-term borrowing rates before the election. The Treasury's Borrowing Advisory Committee has encouraged the Treasury to consider canceling or modifying the forward guidance on debt auction sizes, with some members advocating for its complete removal and others suggesting a more toned-down language. However, at least for now, Deese has decided to continue using Yellen's policy language. The focus behind this phrase is the speculation that the US will continue to increase its debt issuance. Given the US government's long-term fiscal deficit, traders widely expect Deese to decide to issue more long-term US debt at some point, with speculation pointing to a time frame between August this year and next year. The Treasury has also stated that it will use short-term Treasury bills with a maturity of up to one year to meet any seasonal or unexpected borrowing needs over the next three months. Since the US debt ceiling has been restarted since the beginning of this year, the Treasury has taken extraordinary measures to avoid violating the ceiling. The department has also stated: 'Before the debt ceiling is suspended or raised, debt ceiling-related restrictions will cause the volatility of bond issuance to be greater than normal levels and significantly use cash management bonds.' For Deese, another uncertainty in measuring debt issuance demand is when the Federal Reserve will end its quantitative tightening. Currently, the Fed sells $250 billion in US debt to the market each month, so ending quantitative tightening will reduce the Treasury's debt issuance demand. The advisory committee now believes that the Fed's quantitative tightening will end in the summer, with a risk that the end date will be later.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 05:18 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202502063311382396.html)\n\n**U.S. Treasury to Issue First Benchmark 6-Week Treasury Bill Amid**\nThe U.S. Treasury Department plans to issue its first benchmark 6-week Treasury bill, marking a transition from regular 6-week cash management bills. The announcement for the auction will be made shortly, with the new benchmark bills maintaining a consistent settlement and maturity cycle. However, the Treasury has highlighted that until the debt ceiling is suspended or raised, there will be significant volatility in the issuance of benchmark Treasury bills. This reflects the constraints imposed by the debt limit. The Treasury had previously announced its intention to transform the regular 6-week cash management bills into a benchmark product, integrating it into the regular issuance schedule, as part of ongoing discussions since 2020.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 03:58 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2682394/us-treasury-to-issue-first-benchmark-6week-treasury-bill-amid-debt-limit-concerns)\n\n**US Treasury to Maintain Auction Sizes, Gradually Increase TIPS Auctions**\nThe US Department of the Treasury announced that it will maintain the sizes of its coupon and floating-rate note auctions in the next quarters, but will continue to gradually increase the size of its Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) auctions. The Treasury said it will increase the reopening of 10-year TIPS in March by $1 billion, to $18 billion, and will increase the new issuance auction of 5-year TIPS in April to $25 billion. The department also plans to sell $125 billion in its quarterly refunding next week, raising $18.8 billion in new cash and refunding $106.2 billion in securities, including $58 billion in 3-year notes, $42 billion in 10-year notes, and $25 billion in 30-year notes. The Treasury also noted that there will be 'a greater variability than normal in the issuance of reference notes and a significant use' of cash management notes until the US debt ceiling is increased or suspended. The Treasury expects to resume cash management note repurchases around the April 2025 fiscal date, in addition to planned liquidity support repurchases.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 03:17 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/tesouro-dos-eua-mantera-tamanho-da-maioria-de-seus-leiloes-nos-proximos-trimestres,814d6f40d6252365af43450254881f1eug5uy0d2.html)\n\n**'They will pay a price': Senator vows to 'make life difficult for complicit Republicans'**\nSen.

Murphy stated that Democrats will not move forward with nominees or legislation in the Senate until Republicans get serious about the crisis, and will not help them raise the debt ceiling to pass their tax cut for billionaires and millionaires. He emphasized that 'it only takes one senator to stop expedited confirmation of some cabinet nominees' and that Democrats will not grant expedited confirmation to anyone until the crisis passes.

The dollar index weakened over the month but is now firming on the latest tariff news. Equities, bonds, and Forex were volatile during the month, with a steep drop in US equity markets driven by a sell-off in tech stocks in response to the emergence of DeepSeek. However, several positive earnings surprises and upbeat forward guidance helped the major indexes recover some of their earlier losses. A new risk is emerging: US tariffs, which are set to take effect on or after 12:01 a.m. ET on February 4 2025. The tariffs are expected to generate approximately $150 billion in annual revenue, equivalent to a 10-11% increase in the corporate tax rate. The effective tariff rate is projected to rise by 6%. Strategas notes that Mexico's tariffs were largely priced in, while Canada still has room to adjust. The yuan's recent appreciation suggests it has yet to fully price in the 10% tariff increase, and we anticipate further supply chain shifts as a result. One potential upside of tariffs is that higher revenues could reduce Treasury issuance in 2025. Our asset allocation preferences are based on 5 indicators, including 4 macro and fundamental indicators (leading) and 1 market dynamics (coincident). The weight of the evidence suggests to maintain an overweight allocation to equities. Global economic growth is still positive when entering 2025, with diverging dynamics in key economic areas. Inflation is no longer surprising to the downside and might face renewed upward pressures in DM. However, most central banks are still pursuing a path of monetary policy easing, although the size of future rate cuts may be smaller than expected in regions where fiscal policy is supporting growth and inflation.. Broad financial conditions remain generally accommodative. Fiscal stimulus in the US and China will act as support to broad financial conditions in 2025. A debt ceiling crisis in the US could lead to a temporary liquidity injection if the US Treasury uses its cash balance to cover spendings and bond redemptions. However, it's important to consider the impact of the 'Liquidity Bazooka' tied to the debt ceiling not being raised before August. This liquidity boost -- estimated at over $300 billion in the next six weeks -- is more than twice the annualised revenue from the newly imposed tariffs and could provide a cushion for financial markets as the tariffs take effect..\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 08:32 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/markets-eye-shortterm-volatility-but-longterm-bull-case-remains-intact-200656980)\n\n**US Treasury to Borrow $1.665 Trillion Over Next Six Months**\nThe US Treasury plans to borrow $1.665 trillion over the next six months, according to a statement made by the department on February 3. This is a significant increase from the previous estimate of $1.655 trillion. The Treasury expects to borrow $815 billion from January to March, which is $9 billion less than the previous estimate due to a higher cash balance at the start of the quarter. From April to June, the Treasury expects to borrow $123 billion. The new head of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, has criticized his predecessor, Janet Yellen, for relying too heavily on short-term debt to finance the national debt and manage growing budget deficits. Bessent has suggested that the government should issue longer-term debt and maintain a smaller cash reserve. This change could inject volatility into the bond market. The Treasury will provide a detailed plan for its bond sales and debt repayment in its February 5 report. Bessent has also expressed support for abolishing the debt ceiling, a move that has been backed by President Donald Trump. However, the debt ceiling is expected to be reached in June or July, at which point the government will face the risk of defaulting on its debt unless Congress and the president agree to raise the limit.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 10:14 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN \u00c9POCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/tesoro-ee-uu-planea-pedir-prestados-usd-1665-billones-proximos-6-meses-1332317.html)\n\n**$9 trillion of US debt will mature in 2025; Should investors be worried?**\nThe US national debt has reached $36.2 trillion, with $9.2 trillion set to mature in 2025, accounting for 25.4% of the country's total debt. This has raised concerns over financial markets, interest rates, and economic stability. The rapid accumulation of debt has been fueled by historic levels of deficit spending, with the federal deficit for 2024 standing at $1.8 trillion, or 6.4% of GDP. Interest payments on the debt have ballooned to over $1 trillion per year. The government will be forced to issue massive amounts of new bonds to meet this, increasing Treasury supply and potentially driving yields even higher. The bond market has already shown signs of stress, with real yields steadily climbing since 2022.

The Treasury's new chief, Bessent, will face challenges in refinancing maturing short-term debt in an elevated interest-rate climate. Domestic demand has been anemic, and foreign buyers have accounted for a large share of Treasury purchases. The benchmark 10-year yield is about 4.56 percent, and the debt ceiling is a growing concern. Bessent has expressed support for abolishing the debt ceiling, and President Donald Trump has also endorsed efforts to eliminate the limit. 'This gives Congress and the new president time to, once again, get out of this self-inflicted kerfuffle, likely until the summer months,' said Lawrence Gillum, the chief fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.

The Treasury Department has suspended the issuance of debt through March 14, 2025, due to the $36.1 trillion debt ceiling being hit. This suspension could provide relief from supply/demand concerns that have pushed Treasury yields higher, according to Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed-income strategist at LPL Financial. 'This suspension period could provide some well-needed (albeit temporary) relief from supply/demand concerns that have helped push Treasury yields higher recently,' Gillum said. Lower bond supply could be a win-win for investors who own both stocks and bonds, but lingering debt ceiling issues could raise concerns. Eric Wallerstein, chief markets strategist at Yardeni Research, noted that lower bond supply would 'technically' be positive for asset prices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 09:15 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

According to a letter from former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, these measures were put in place on January 21, 2025, as the US has reached its maximum allowed level of government debt. The Treasury Department is forced to implement a set of tools that reduce internal spending and redirect payments to service the national debt, including interest payments. The first of these tools is the reduction of investments in the Civil Service Retirement Fund and the Postal Service Health Benefits Fund. Further measures to reduce spending will be implemented by the Treasury Department in a step-by-step manner and may remain in effect until March 14, 2025, until the threat of default is avoided. The current level of US government debt is estimated at $36.197 trillion, according to the US Treasury Department's data as of January 16. The US temporarily suspended the debt ceiling in June 2023, when former President Joe Biden signed a deal with Congress, freeing himself from the need to raise the borrowing limit until January 2, 2025. The new debt ceiling is equivalent to the amount of unpaid debt at the end of the previous day. According to Treasury Department data, this figure was over $36.218 trillion as of December 31. In December, before taking office, former President Donald Trump demanded that his Republican colleagues repeal the debt ceiling before his return to the White House, but this was not done. As a result, the executive and legislative branches of the US government will have to return to this issue in January. The growing national debt is further complicated for Washington by the growing costs of paying interest on it. According to Treasury Department calculations, the US government paid over $1 trillion in interest on its national debt in 2024, a first in its history. The volume of spending on these purposes will continue to grow, further depriving the government of funds for economic development and pushing it deeper into debt.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 04:42 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250121/defolt-1994881972.html)\n\n**US Approaches Debt Ceiling, Treasury Department Takes Extraordinary Measures**\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned Congress on January 17 that the federal government is approaching its debt ceiling. To avoid default, the Treasury Department will take extraordinary measures starting from January 21. Yellen urged Congress to act quickly to raise or suspend the debt ceiling to maintain the US's creditworthiness and economic stability. The Treasury Department plans to implement a 'pause in issuing new debt' from January 21 to March 14, during which time it will halt new funding for the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Health Benefits Fund, ensuring the government can continue to operate within its existing funding framework. However, if the debt ceiling issue is not resolved in the short term, the US may face the risk of default. Previously, Congress passed a resolution in 2023 to temporarily suspend the debt ceiling, but it expired on January 2, 2025. New Treasury Secretary Scott Bessenet, nominated by Trump, said that if supported, he would work with the new administration to explore the possibility of eliminating the debt ceiling. Failure to address the debt ceiling issue in a timely manner could lead to government default, causing severe impacts on the US and global economies.

The agency notes that the US is facing major budgetary policy challenges, including the debt ceiling, budget allocations, and tax cuts. These challenges are occurring in a context of already significant budget deficits and growing public debt. The report also highlights the chronic dysfunction of the federal budget process and the Republican majority in the House of Representatives, making it unlikely that these problems will be resolved quickly. Fitch Ratings notes that the temporary measure suspending the debt ceiling, which expired at the beginning of the year, will be replaced by a new ceiling of $36.1 billion, which is expected to take effect between January 14 and 23. The report also notes that the budget bill passed in December will provide funding to the government until March 14, and that the tax cuts implemented in 2017 will expire at the end of 2025. According to Fitch Ratings, it is likely that the debt ceiling will be raised or suspended again, but discussions on this issue are unlikely to occur before early 2025 due to persistent disagreements in Congress over budget policies. The report also notes that the government shutdown was narrowly avoided before Christmas, and that this process was particularly contentious due to the intervention of President-elect Donald Trump. The report concludes that the budget deficits for 2025 and 2026 are expected to exceed 7.5% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 08:33 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/fr/%C3%A9conomie/fitch-pr%C3%A9dit-des-tensions-en-2025-les-finances-publiques-am%C3%A9ricaines-sous-pression/3444247)\n\n**US Debt Ceiling Could Be Reached as Early as Mid-January**\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the US could hit its debt ceiling as early as mid-January. The current debt ceiling was suspended until January 1, 2025, but a new limit will be set on January 2, corresponding to the amount of debt issued by the Department of the Treasury. Yellen stated, 'The Treasury expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and 23, at which point it will need to take extraordinary measures.' These measures would allow the Treasury to continue financing government activities and avoid late payments. However, the US is unlikely to immediately hit the limit on January 2, as the country's debt is expected to decrease by around $54 billion due to a bond redemption. The US has raised the debt ceiling over 100 times to allow the government to meet its spending commitments. However, conservatives are generally opposed to massive borrowing, which currently stands at over $36 trillion. If the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended before the Treasury's tools are exhausted, the government risks defaulting on its payments, which would have severe repercussions on the world's largest economy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 10:02 AM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/actualite-bourse/USA-la-nouvelle-limite-de-la-dette-pourrait-etre-atteinte-des-la-mi-janvier-48661774/)\n\n**US on Brink of Debt Ceiling Crisis: Yellen Warns of 'Extraordinary Measures'**\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has stated that the US may reach its debt ceiling as early as mid-January.

The current suspension of the debt ceiling ends on January 1st, 2025, and a new limit will be set on January 2nd, 2025, based on the current debt level. If the US reaches this new limit, further action may be contentious, as the issue of raising the debt ceiling has been a source of political tension for years. If the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended before the Treasury Department's options are exhausted, the US may face insolvency, with far-reaching consequences for the world's largest economy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 07:51 AM\nSource:[kurier.at](https://kurier.at/politik/ausland/usa-2025-neue-schuldenobergrenze/402992773)\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Warns of Debt Ceiling Crisis**\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that the US may reach its debt ceiling as early as January 14, 2025, urging Congress to 'take action to protect America's full faith and credit.' The current debt ceiling has been temporarily suspended until January 1, 2025, but this means that a new debt limit will be set on January 2, 2025, which will match the amount of debt issued by the Treasury Department. Yellen stated in a letter to Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and other lawmakers, 'The Treasury Department currently expects to reach the new debt limit between January 14 and January 23, at which point the Treasury Department will be forced to take extraordinary measures.' These measures will allow the Treasury Department to continue providing funds for government activities and prevent a debt default. The US Congress has raised the debt ceiling over 100 times to allow the government to fulfill its spending commitments. However, conservative lawmakers have generally opposed increasing the US's massive borrowing, and many Republicans have never voted to raise the debt limit. The US's total debt currently stands at $36.2 trillion. If the debt ceiling is not raised or suspended before the Treasury Department's tools are exhausted, the government will face a risk of debt default, which will have a profound impact on the world's largest economy.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 04:00 AM\nSource:[ETtoday\u65b0\u805e\u96f2](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20241228/2882181.htm)\n\n**US Debt Ceiling Debate Escalates Despite Compromise**\nThe US Congress and the Senate have reached a compromise to avoid a government shutdown, but the agreement does not mask the dysfunction among Republicans and the growing influence of billionaire Elon Musk in the circle of future US President Donald Trump. The temporary funding solution, which will last until mid-March, has prevented a shutdown that would have caused logistical chaos, including canceled flights and disrupted government services. However, the compromise has come at the cost of Democats having to give up funding for various social and health programs. Trump had also suffered a setback, as he was denied an extension of the debt ceiling beyond the current period. The Congress had initially suspended the debt limit until early 2025, but the national debt has already exceeded $35 trillion. As a result, the Treasury Department will have to resort to extraordinary measures to keep the government running, which will be exhausted by mid-2025. Without a higher debt ceiling, Trump will also be unable to pass the promised tax cuts, which are not funded. Republicans had promised to pass a long-term budget bill after the new Congress is sworn in, which would raise the debt limit and include significant cuts to social programs. However, not only Democrats, but also fiscally conservative Republicans are opposed to a higher debt ceiling, demonstrating that Trump will face resistance from within his own party. Trump had built immense pressure on recalcitrant Republicans to comply, threatening to support primary challengers and mobilize his supporters against them. Despite the Republican majorities in both chambers, it is far from certain that they will be able to fulfill their promise to Trump.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 23, 2024 09:10 AM\nSource:[boersen-zeitung.de](https://www.boersen-zeitung.de/konjunktur-politik/us-schuldenkrise-dauert-trotz-uebergangsfinanzierung-an)\n\n**Why Trump Wants to Eliminate the 'Debt Ceiling' Before Returning to the White House**\nDonald Trump wants to eliminate the 'debt ceiling' before returning to the White House. The current debt ceiling was suspended until January 1, 2025. If lawmakers fail to agree on raising or suspending it before that date, the Treasury Department may take 'extraordinary measures' for several months to avoid debt payment problems. Reducing government spending is a challenge, as a significant portion of the budget goes towards mandatory benefits like Social Security checks. Trump's tax plan may be easier to pass in Congress if the debt ceiling is lifted or suspended, as it would reduce government revenue and require spending cuts to avoid increasing the debt.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 11:31 AM\nSource:[Univision](https://www.univision.com/noticias/politica/por-que-trump-pide-se-elimine-el-techo-deuda-debt-limit)\n\n**US House of Representatives Rejects Bill to Extend Government Funding and Raise Debt Ceiling**\nThe US House of Representatives did not pass a bill to temporarily extend government funding and raise the debt ceiling.

The bill aimed to extend government funding until March 14, 2025, and suspend the debt ceiling until January 30, 2027. According to The Washington Post, the US may face a government shutdown today, December 20, due to disagreements in Congress. 'The House of Representatives did not support the bill,' said no one, but the outcome is clear: the bill was rejected.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 04:40 AM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/money/economy/v-kongresse-ssha-ne-podderzhali-zakonoproekt-o-finansirovanii-pravitelstva)\n\n**Trump Suggests Abolishing US Debt Ceiling**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has suggested that the US Congress should abolish the debt ceiling, a day after opposing a deal to fund the federal government before a shutdown. Trump said, 'The most intelligent thing the Congress could do is to abolish the debt ceiling.' He added that he would support efforts to abolish it completely. Trump also stated that the debt ceiling 'means nothing, except psychologically.' Senator Elizabeth Warren supported Trump's proposal, saying, 'I agree with President-elect Trump that Congress should end the debt limit and never again govern by hostage-taking.' The debt ceiling has been in place for nearly a century, serving as the maximum amount that lawmakers can borrow to meet existing obligations, such as Social Security, Medicare, and interest payments. However, raising the debt ceiling does not authorize new spending. In May 2023, President Joe Biden and then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) raised the debt ceiling and suspended it until January 1, 2025. Trump has previously suggested that the US should default on its debt if Democrats do not agree to spending cuts. He told a CNN town hall in New Hampshire in May 2023, 'We're going to probably not default because the Democrats will absolutely cave.' Trump also criticized the bipartisan spending bill, which included a 1,500-page agreement to keep the government funded until March 14 and provided $100 billion for disaster relief and $10 billion for agricultural aid. Trump rejected the bill due to add-ons that included a congressional pay raise, measures against hidden hotel tariffs, and what he called 'pro-government censoring provisions.' The House has until 12:01 a.m. on Saturday to avoid a shutdown. Trump has suggested that he would prefer to have a debate on the debt ceiling before taking office next month. He wrote on Truth Social on December 18, 'Raising the debt ceiling is not great, but we would prefer to do it in Biden's guard. If Democrats don't want to cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes someone think they would do it in June during our administration?' Trump stated that his party wants to support farmers, pay disaster relief, and ensure that the US can succeed in 2025. 'The only way to do it is with a temporary funding bill without Democratic handouts combined with an increase in the debt ceiling. Anything else is a betrayal of our country,' he wrote. Elon Musk agreed, complaining about the funding measure on X on December 18. 'Any member of the House of Representatives or Senate who votes for this scandalous spending bill deserves to be expelled in 2 years!' Musk wrote. 'Or there's a massive change or the US is going to bankruptcy, so there must be a massive change!' Several lawmakers, including Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), criticized Musk's participation, with Sanders calling him 'President Elon Musk' and saying that billionaires do not run the US government. 'Democrats and Republicans spent months negotiating a bipartisan agreement to fund our government. The richest man in the world, President Elon Musk, doesn't like it. Will the Republicans kiss the ring?' Sanders wrote on X. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has signaled that he and his Republican colleagues will return to the negotiating table. Any framework would require bipartisan support in both chambers, as the GOP has a narrow majority in the House and Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) criticized the decision and accused Republicans of breaking a bipartisan agreement they had negotiated. 'House Republicans have been ordered to shut down the government and harm ordinary Americans across the country,' Jeffries said. 'A deal is a deal. It was bipartisan, and there was nothing more to say.' In recent years, Congress has relied on continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills to fund the government. According to the Treasury Department's Debt-to-the-Penny Dashboard, the national debt stands at $36.2 trillion.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 08:07 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN \u00c9POCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/trump-ee-uu-deberia-abolir-techo-deuda-1324599.html)\n\n**US Government at Risk of Shutdown This Week, But Analysts Expect Brief Disruption**\nThe US government is at risk of a shutdown this week, with only two days left before the funding deadline. However, according to Goldman Sachs analysts, the shutdown is unlikely to last long. The uncertainty remains high due to President-elect Donald Trump's opposition to the proposed spending bill and his unexpected demand for a higher debt ceiling. The Congressional leaders presented a proposal on December 17 to extend funding until March 14, 2025, which also includes $100 billion for disaster relief and agricultural support. However, the Republicans are not strongly supporting this measure, and Trump's objections are complicating the negotiations. Despite this, analysts note that Trump supports key elements of the bill, which gives hope for a compromise before the deadline. If an agreement is not reached, the Republicans may insist on a short-term 'clean' extension of funding to avoid a shutdown. However, this would delay the resolution of issues such as disaster relief until 2025, which Goldman Sachs believes would not be acceptable to either side. The debt ceiling is also a point of contention. Although the debt ceiling suspension expires on January 2, 2025, the Treasury is likely to continue borrowing until the third quarter of 2025. Analysts consider this to reduce the need for immediate action, but Trump's attention to this issue suggests it may return to the agenda in early 2025. Goldman Sachs estimates that each week of government shutdown would reduce quarterly GDP growth by 0.15%, with an equivalent bounce-back after the government resumes work. While a short-term shutdown is possible, analysts consider a prolonged impasse unlikely.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 07:57 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/economy/article-2604857)\n\n",
