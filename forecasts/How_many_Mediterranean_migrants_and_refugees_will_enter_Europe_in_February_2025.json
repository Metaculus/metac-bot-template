In the Jikharra area, 19 bodies were found in a mass grave, believed to be related to smuggling activities. The directorate stated, 'In the presence of the Public Prosecution Office in Jalu, the directorate was able to recover 19 bodies resulting from smuggling and illegal migration activities in Jikharra area, belonging to a known smuggling network.' Separately, the Libyan Red Crescent recovered 10 bodies after their boat sank off Dila port in Zawiya. The bodies were referred to a forensic doctor for necessary tests.

According to the Interior Ministry, 58% of the migrants were from West Africa, 12% from North Africa, and 9% from East and Central Africa. The ministry cited 'growing migratory pressure in an unstable regional environment' as the reason for the increase. Morocco and Spain have strengthened cooperation against undocumented migration since 2022. Moroccan authorities rescued 18,645 would-be migrants from unseaworthy boats in 2024, a 10.8% increase from 2023.

Morocco has increased cooperation with Spain to combat migration through the Mediterranean and Atlantic routes. The country's Interior Ministry reported that Moroccan authorities saved 18,645 migrants from unsafe vessels in 2024, a 10.8% increase from the previous year. However, tragedy struck last month when up to 50 migrants are believed to have drowned while attempting the perilous journey across the Atlantic to Spain's Canary Islands.

Between New Year's and the previous weekend, the UNHCR documented 12,137 people who arrived in Europe via the Mediterranean. Eight people died or went missing, and 2,824 people were counted as dead or missing at sea in 2024. The EU's border protection agency Frontex has been criticized for not using its funds to rescue people in distress. Instead, it informs the rescue centers in EU member states and in Libya and Tunisia when it detects boats with asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants. However, it does not inform non-state rescue boats, which can lead to people being intercepted and forcibly returned to Libya or Tunisia, where they are exposed to severe human rights violations. The EU has also made agreements with third countries, such as Turkey and Morocco, to return people to their countries of origin. The EU's reform of the Common European Asylum System, which will only grant a regular asylum procedure to those who do not come through a safe third country, is also criticized. 'Alarm Phone' calls for justice and remembers the victims of the EU's migration policies. 'We are committed to remembering those who have died or gone missing in their pursuit of freedom of movement, and to expressing our demands for justice,' the initiative says. Gedenkfeiern (memorial services) will take place in around 60 cities worldwide on Thursday. 'It is a principle that the EU gives money, and they 'take the people back' or prevent them from crossing the border,' says Human Rights Watch. The EU's policy has been criticized by many, including the former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who was stopped by the Supreme Court, and the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who is holding on to her Albanian model despite court decisions. CDU leader Friedrich Merz is also calling for border closures and a 'strengthening' of the right to asylum in Germany, effectively abolishing it.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[jungewelt.de](https://www.jungewelt.de/artikel/493396.commemoraction-erinnerung-an-namenlose.html)\n\n**African Migration to Europe and the Middle East Decreases, but Pressure Remains**\nThe number of African migrants attempting to cross into Europe and the Middle East has decreased significantly over the past year, according to recent data. In 2024, 146,000 African migrants were intercepted attempting to cross into Europe and the Middle East, a 52% decrease from the 282,000 cases recorded in 2023. This decline is attributed to increased efforts by the EU to prevent migration in North Africa (Libya, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt) and West Africa (Senegal and Mauritania). For example, Moroccan authorities report that they have prevented over 45,000 border crossings into Europe, arrested 177 human trafficking groups, and rescued over 10,800 people at sea in 2024. The number of African migrants attempting to cross into Yemen, a primary entry point into the Middle East, has decreased by 54% to 44,000, due to a combination of factors including the ongoing conflict in Yemen and a propaganda campaign against irregular migration through the Bab-el-Mandab Strait, led by the government of Djibouti. The number of African migrants who have died attempting to cross into Europe has decreased by 15% to 4,465, with 75% of these deaths occurring while attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. According to the UN, the number of African migrants (excluding refugees and asylum seekers) living in another African country has increased by 25% over the past 10 years, from 12 million in 2015 to 15 million in 2024. However, this number is likely underestimated, as much of internal migration in Africa is labor migration. A recent survey by the Afrobarometer found that nearly 50% of Africans are considering emigrating, a significant increase from 2016-2018. Given the projected 70% increase in Africa's population to 2.4 billion by 2050, it is likely that migration pressure on Europe and the Middle East will continue.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 11:03 AM\nSource:[bb.lv](https://bb.lv/statja/v-mire/2025/02/07/banka-po-cernomu-polovina-zitelei-afriki-gotova-bezat-v-es)\n\n**Quarterly Mixed Migration Update: Europe Quarter 4 - 2024 - Cyprus**\nThe Quarterly Mixed Migration Update (QMMU) for Europe in Quarter 4 of 2024 highlights several key trends and developments. Notably, the total number of registered arrivals in Europe decreased to 199,200 in 2024, down from 270,700 in 2023, with the Central Mediterranean route experiencing a significant decline. However, the Eastern Mediterranean route to Greece saw a 27% increase, and the Western Africa / Atlantic route to the Canary Islands experienced a 16% rise. The update also reports on Cyprus granting entry to dozens of migrants trapped in the buffer zone, Greece and Cyprus facing condemnation from the European Court of Human Rights for pushbacks, and Italy's Albania migrant centre facing legal challenges. Furthermore, the update notes worsening humanitarian conditions in the Canary Islands, with calls for more central government support and the redistribution of underage migrants. Additionally, Spain has announced an ambitious regularisation programme for undocumented migrants, while Croatia has been accused of incinerating migrant belongings in 'burn piles'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/cyprus/quarterly-mixed-migration-update-europe-quarter-4-2024)\n\n**Continua la crisi umanitaria nel Mediterraneo centrale, OIM: 'A gennaio pi\u00f9 di duemila migranti intercettati e riportati in Libia'**\nThe Mediterranean central region continues to be the scene of one of the most severe humanitarian crises in recent years. According to the International Organization for Migration (OIM), at least 36 people died while attempting to cross the sea to reach Europe between January 1st and February 1st, 2025. Additionally, at least one person is missing. In the same period, over 2,000 people were intercepted at sea and brought back to Libya, 'only' 592 between January 26th and February 1st, 2025. The OIM report highlights the stories of people fleeing wars, persecutions, famines, and political instability, seeking a better life. The Mediterranean central route remains one of the most dangerous in the world, with overcrowded and often unsuitable boats challenging the open sea, leaving thousands of migrants, including women and children, often very young, at the mercy of the waves. The OIM report also notes that in the first month of the year, 2,398 people were intercepted at sea and brought back to Libya by local authorities. Among them, 1,984 men, 301 women, and 113 children. For many of them, returning to Libya means the nightmare of arbitrary detention, torture, and exploitation. Humanitarian organizations have been denouncing for years that Libyan detention centers are places of systematic violence, where migrants and refugees are victims of abuse, slavery, and human trafficking. The support of the European Union to the Libyan authorities, through funding and cooperation in border control, and that of Italy, through the so-called Memorandum of Understanding, raises serious questions about the responsibility of European institutions in these ongoing human rights violations. The Memorandum of Understanding between Italy and Libya, signed on February 2nd, 2017, is an agreement aimed at blocking migrant departures to Italy through the strengthening of cooperation with Libyan authorities, of which also Marco Minniti, then Minister of the Interior, was a great supporter. Financed with hundreds of millions of euros by Italy and the European Union, the Memorandum has provided the supply of patrol boats and logistical support to the so-called Libyan Coast Guard, composed mainly of militias with direct links to human trafficking. The agreement has led to the systematic interception and capture of migrants at sea, with their subsequent transfer to Libyan detention centers, real lagers where, according to numerous reports by the United Nations and international NGOs, crimes against humanity are perpetrated: torture, rape, slavery, and murder. Despite repeated denunciations and concrete evidence of the involvement of Libyan militia leaders in human trafficking, including the well-known Libyan general accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity, Osama Njeem Almasri, or Abdul Rahman al-Milad, known as 'Bija', present at an official meeting at the Viminale in 2017, the Memorandum has been renewed several times, with the support of various Italian governments. The operations of repulsion conducted in collaboration with Libya have been denounced to the International Criminal Court for violation of international norms on human rights, while the same International Criminal Court has confirmed that the crimes committed in Libyan detention centers are configured as war crimes and crimes against humanity. Despite numerous denunciations and reports from humanitarian organizations, the international community's response seems inadequate. Access to humanitarian aid for asylum seekers is limited, funds for migrant protection are insufficient, and safe corridors seem almost non-existent. The United Nations and NGOs have been asking for years for urgent interventions to address the root causes of forced migration, such as conflicts, inequalities, climate change, and persecutions. Parallelly, they call for the creation of legal pathways for refugees and migrants, in order to reduce human trafficking and the number of victims along migration routes.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 10:09 AM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/politica/continua-la-crisi-umanitaria-nel-mediterraneo-centrale-oim-a-gennaio-piu-di-duemila-migranti-intercettati-e-riportati-in-libia/)\n\n**At Least 36 Migrants Dead, 1 Missing in Central Mediterranean in 2025**\nAccording to the International Organization for Migration (OIM), at least 36 people have lost their lives in the central Mediterranean route from the beginning of the year to February 1st.

So far this year, 2,398 migrants have been intercepted and returned to Libya, while 36 have died on the Central Mediterranean route. In 2024, 21,762 migrants were rescued and returned to Libya, with 674 deaths and 1,015 missing on the route.

This is the most likely scenario, according to a note released today. A second scenario (with a probability of occurrence of 25-35%) estimates 32,000 (+/- 5,000) requests, while a third (10-15%) predicts 20,000 (+/- 2,000). The actual number of requests will depend on how many people emigrate from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria and then migrate to central and western Europe. The evolution of migration movements from North Africa to Italy via the Mediterranean is also crucial, as highlighted in the statement. Last year, 27,740 asylum requests were submitted in Switzerland, a decrease of 2,483 compared to 30,223 in 2023 (-8% approximately). Of these, 6,521 were secondary requests (e.g. births, family reunifications or multiple asylum requests). Approximately 3,300 secondary requests were submitted by people from Afghanistan who had already been residing in the Confederation for some time and submitted another request.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/it/attualita/svizzera/asilo-previste-meno-richieste-nel-2025-2542454.html)\n\n**Irregular Entries in Europe Decrease by 38% in 2024, But New Routes Emerge**\nAccording to Frontex, the number of irregular entries in Europe has decreased by 38% in 2024 compared to 2023, reaching its lowest level since 2021. In 2024, 239,000 people, including 10% of women and 16% of minors, attempted to enter Europe irregularly, down from 380,000 in 2023. The decline is mainly seen on the 'Mediterranean Central' and 'Balkans' routes, which are the most used migration routes. However, despite the efforts of the European Union and transit countries to combat smugglers and block irregular entries, migrants are adapting and exploring new routes, making their journeys even more perilous. The number of attempts to enter Europe via the Canary Islands has increased by 18%, with nearly 47,000 refugees arriving in Spain and overwhelming the archipelago's reception capacities. The number of attempts via the eastern Mediterranean (Greece, Cyprus) has also increased by 14% in 2024. The number of attempts via the eastern borders has increased by 192%, with 17,000 people crossing the borders of Poland, Lithuania, or Finland via Russia and Belarus. These two countries are accused of 'instrumentalizing migrants' by providing them with equipment to cross the EU's borders. The European Commission has granted Poland the right to temporarily derogate from the asylum law to address this issue.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 16, 2025 01:05 PM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2025/01/16/avec-38-de-baisse-le-nombre-d-entrees-irregulieres-en-europe-enregistre-son-niveau-le-plus-bas-depuis-2021_6501301_3210.html)\n\n**Mediterranean claimed more than 2,200 migrant lives in 2024.

The deaths come after a year of increasing crackdowns on civilian rescue boats and an attempt by Italy's far-right government to pass asylum-seekers off to Albania. Michael Gordon, a research fellow at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, said that the 'criminalization' of search-and-rescue operations has led to fewer assets assisting migrants in distress, resulting in more deaths. Regina De Dominicis, UNICEF's regional director for Europe and Central Asia, stated that 'hundreds of children' have died in the Mediterranean, who are fleeing violent conflict and poverty. The EU has focused on origin countries for migrant control, delivering millions of euros in aid to Tunisia and Egypt, but human rights groups have stated that returning migrants found at sea to Libya exposes them to torture and abuse.

'The fact that we have fewer arrivals does not mean that we have fewer risks,' Nicola Dell'Arciprete, country co-ordinator of UNICEF's migration and refugee response in Italy, said. Dell'Arciprete added that minimizing migrant deaths requires more investment in reception centres, contingency plans for high-arrival periods, more safe and legal pathways for immigration and strengthened search-and-rescue operations. 'Until we strengthen the search-and-rescue operations, until we create safe and legal pathways for children to travel to Europe, we are going to see more people dying,' Dell'Arciprete said.

Given these considerations, I distribute initial probabilities as follows: Lower migration (0-10,000) is less likely during this specific period, mid-range migration (10,001-15,000) is relatively more probable, and higher migration (15,001-20,000 or more) is possible but less frequent.",
