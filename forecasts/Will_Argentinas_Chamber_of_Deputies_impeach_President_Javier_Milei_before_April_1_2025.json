He will highlight his administration's achievements, including the reduction of inflation and a zero fiscal deficit. Milei is also expected to outline his plans for the second year of his term, which coincides with the midterm elections. The president hopes to reverse the current minority in both chambers. Milei's speech is anticipated to include the possible modification of the Penal Code with a more 'punitive' approach, as well as the elimination of femicide as an aggravating factor. The session will be broadcast nationally, and it is expected that Vice President Victoria Villarruel and President of the Chamber of Deputies Mart\u00edn Menem will attend. The event will also feature special guests, including members of the Supreme Court of Justice.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 09:49 AM\nSource:[El Litoral](https://www.ellitoral.com/politica/milei-asamblea-legislativa-gestion-villarruel-senado-menem-corte-anuncios-codigo-penal-femicidio_0_beHPu2w3Qw.html)\n\n**Milei Announces Opening of Congress Sessions for Saturday Night**\nPresident Javier Milei has announced that the opening of the ordinary sessions of the Congress will take place on Saturday, March 1st at 9 PM. This move is seen as an attempt to secure a large audience through a prime-time television broadcast. Milei's speech is currently being written and is expected to reflect his first year in office. Unlike last year's opening, where the focus was on the 'inherited legacy', this year Milei plans to present a balance of his own management and introduce new legislative proposals for 2025. Santiago Caputo, Milei's advisor, is coordinating the details of the speech, generating expectations in the political circle. The event also poses a challenge for the Executive's relations with the Judiciary, as Milei is pushing for the presence of the full Supreme Court during the ceremony. However, this move has raised concerns, especially in the context of the controversy surrounding the nominations of judges Ariel Lijo and Manuel Garc\u00eda Mansilla. Despite the setback in the Chamber of Deputies, where the officialism failed to gather the necessary votes for their designation, the Milei government has stated its intention to continue and nominate these figures by decree. This move has generated reservations and uncertainties, with warnings from the Palace of Tribunals about the risks associated with such decisions. The judges, who would still maintain their positions in the Judiciary, would face the uncertainty of resigning to accept new designations, a situation that presents significant personal and professional implications. The opening of sessions will not only be a platform for Javier Milei to reaffirm his leadership, but also a reflection of the current challenging political scenario in Argentina, forcing the president to rethink his strategy in a game of politics where the standard rules are suspended.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[noticiasnet.com.ar](https://www.noticiasnet.com.ar/noticias/2025/02/26/173207-milei-confirmo-la-apertura-de-las-sesiones-ordinarias-en-el-congreso-para-el-sabado-a-la-noche)\n\n**Milei to Deliver Speech on 'Cultural Battle' at Congress Opening**\nArgentine President Javier Milei is set to deliver a speech at the opening of Congress on Saturday, which will focus on 'deepening the cultural battle'. Milei will be accompanied by Senate President Victoria Villarruel and House of Deputies President Mart\u00edn Menem. The speech is expected to last around 35 minutes and will emphasize the importance of the 'battle cultural' and the need for a 'reconstruction of the country'. Milei will also highlight the results of his economic management, including low inflation and fiscal adjustment. The government has invited Ariel Lijo and Manuel Garc\u00eda Mansilla, two lawyers recently appointed to the Supreme Court, to attend the speech. This move has increased tension in the opposition, who have criticized the appointments by decree. The speech comes at a time of fragmentation among opposition blocs, which the government is seeking to exploit. Milei's speech will also address the recent requests for impeachment proceedings against him related to the Libragate scandal. Additionally, the opposition is still demanding that the government revisit the 2025 Budget. In his previous speech, Milei spoke for 43 minutes and accused lawmakers of being part of a 'caste' that has enriched themselves at the expense of the poor. He also announced a megaproject to eliminate the privileges of politicians and their friends, but most of these initiatives have not been successful in Congress.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 12:49 AM\nSource:[mdzol.com](https://www.mdzol.com/politica/2025/2/25/con-lijo-garcia-mansilla-de-invitados-milei-llega-al-congreso-con-un-discurso-para-profundizar-la-batalla-cultural-1190637.html)\n\n**Convocan sesi\u00f3n especial para investigar a Milei por la cripto Libra**\nA special session has been called in the Chamber of Deputies to investigate President Javier Milei over the Libra cryptocurrency scandal. The request, presented by the Democracia para Siempre block, has the support of other opposition parties. The investigation will include the interrogation of key government officials, including President Milei, his sister and Secretary General of the Presidency, Karina Milei, and the Minister of Justice, Mariano C\u00faneo Libarona. According to the block, it is the responsibility of the Legislative Power to oversee government actions, especially when they are involved in major controversies. The session is scheduled for March 11 at 12:00 and will include all recent projects related to the scandal, except for those that call for Milei's impeachment, which they consider too drastic at this stage of the investigation. Various political sectors have supported the initiative, including legislators from Encuentro Federal. However, the main challenge for the opposition is that the projects lack a report, which means that they will require a special majority of two-thirds to be approved in a special session. To overcome this obstacle, the opposition blocks are considering requesting the emplacement of the relevant committees to report on the initiatives before the debate in the plenary.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 08:10 PM\nSource:[launion.digital](https://www.launion.digital/politica/convocan-sesion-especial-investigar-milei-cripto-libra-n206397)\n\n**Argentina's 2025 Legislative Elections: A Crucial Test for President Milei's Government**\nThe 2025 Argentine legislative elections will determine the stability and future of President Javier Milei's government. The elections will also reconfigure the traditional political forces in the country. The results will have a significant impact on the country's alignment with the new global right-wing and the path it will take in the face of the new world order. President Milei has already begun 2025 by withdrawing Argentina from the WHO, praising Trump's policies, threatening to leave the Paris Agreement, declaring war on 'woke ideology', meeting with Musk, and promoting a fraudulent cryptocurrency that has led to lawsuits and impeachment requests. The elections will be a key test for the government's ability to implement its promised structural reforms, such as the privatization of public companies like Correo Argentino and Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas. The opposition, on the other hand, aims to consolidate a majority to block these decrees and reverse some already challenged in court, such as the labor reform or the privatization of clubs. The outcome of the elections will have significant implications for the future aspirations of the candidates, with a good result potentially strengthening the government's ability to implement reforms and expand its territorial influence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 02:06 PM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20250225/10421406/elecciones-argentinas-2025-definiran-estabilidad-futuro-gobierno-milei.html)\n\n**Opposition Explores Alternatives to Investigate Libra Scandal in Chamber of Deputies**\nThe opposition in Argentina is exploring alternative ways to investigate the Libra cryptocurrency scandal involving President Javier Milei in the Chamber of Deputies, after the impeachment process was blocked in the Senate. Union por la Patria (UxP) presented a project for a parliamentary investigation, but it was more of a statement of intent than a real possibility. The president of the UxP block, Germ\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez, left the door open for a frank dialogue with opposition forces that support a parliamentary investigation. The opposition is seeking a simple majority to approve any of the projects, but the officialism has assigned as many twists as necessary to avoid them being treated. The opposition is now in talks to request a session in the second week of March to emplace the commissions and treat the projects. 'We will insist on getting explanations from the President, who is being treated as a scammer in many world newspapers. It's an uncomfortable moment, but we will keep pushing,' said Oscar Agost Carre\u00f1o, a deputy from Encuentro Federal.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 08:49 AM\nSource:[lacapitalmdp.com](https://www.lacapitalmdp.com/la-oposicion-explora-caminos-en-diputados-para-mantener-viva-la-llama-del-escandalo-cripto/)\n\n**Opposition in Argentina Prepares New Attack on Government Over 'Libra Gate' Scandal**\nThe opposition in Argentina is not giving up on the 'Libra gate' scandal and is preparing another attack against the government. The opposition parliamentary group failed to form a investigative commission in the Senate to determine responsibilities in the dissemination of the Libra cryptocurrency by President Javier Milei, who has opened several judicial fronts. To maintain presence, the commission of Communications and Information, led by Pablo Carro of Union for the Homeland, will meet in the Chamber of Deputies to debate the control of cryptocurrencies and the prevention of scams. The opposition is trying not to let time dilute the media focus on the scandal, which was sparked by a presidential tweet on February 14. According to El Cronista, the guests at the meeting will include Carlos Maslat\u00f3n, a lawyer and self-proclaimed 'bitcoiner', and representatives of the Fintech Chamber, among others. The opposition is also pursuing a request for impeachment against President Milei, but this process is cumbersome and has little chance of advancing, so they are trying to keep the issue visible and, if possible, weaken the libertarian force in Congress. 'Criptogate. Estafa or sucio business?', asked Pablo Carro in social media, one of the opponents who has the leadership of a commission, which allows him to organize meetings and create channels for 'catharsis', although this does not necessarily lead to the treatment of subsequent projects.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 05:42 PM\nSource:[cronista.com](https://www.cronista.com/economia-politica/la-oposicion-no-suelta-el-libra-gate-y-prepara-otra-embestida-contra-el-gobierno/)\n\n**Milei Faces Impeachment as Opposition Prepares Parliamentary Offensive**\nPresident Javier Milei will inaugurate the 143rd period of ordinary sessions of Congress on March 1, amidst the 'cryptogate' scandal. The opposition is preparing a parliamentary offensive with interrogations of officials, revocation of delegated powers, and a request for impeachment, driven by Uni\u00f3n por la Patria. Despite the failure to form an investigative commission in the Senate during extraordinary sessions, the opposition is confident that they can achieve the necessary two-thirds majority to impeach the President. Germ\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez's bloc may repeat the strategy used when Milei presented the budget, sending a small delegation to Parliament to listen to the President's address. The opposition will try to pass a resolution to establish a commission of inquiry and define a plan of action to investigate the President. However, the officialdom is unaware of the designation of Marcela Pagano as president of the commission. The impeachment request is accompanied by other parliamentary initiatives aimed at putting pressure on Milei, such as the project of law that proposes to revoke the delegated powers to the Executive Power through the Law Bases, driven by the deputy Cecilia Moreau. Additionally, Uni\u00f3n por la Patria will try to reject the Decree 70/2023, which remains in force due to the lack of consensus in the Lower Chamber.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 03:01 AM\nSource:[pagina12.com.ar](https://www.pagina12.com.ar/806189-una-apertura-atravezada-por-el-criptogate)\n\n**Milei Faces Consequences for $LIBRA Cryptocurrency Scandal**\nPresident Javier Milei returned to Argentina after being praised by US President Donald Trump, but faces consequences for the $LIBRA cryptocurrency scandal. The scandal has been escalating, and a committee in the Chamber of Deputies will meet to discuss the issue and hear from experts. Milei's sister Karina has been trying to downplay the scandal, but has faced protests and criticism from citizens. The President's office has been trying to distract from the issue, but the committee's investigation may lead to a deeper look into the scandal. Meanwhile, the judiciary is also investigating the case, with multiple lawsuits and denunciations filed against Milei. 'It's illogical that a circumstance like this becomes a political issue,' said Chief of Staff Guillermo Francos, who has been trying to downplay the scandal. However, the committee's investigation may lead to a deeper look into the scandal and potentially even a impeachment process. 'We're going to be able to vote on the creation of the investigative committee and also our proposal for impeachment,' said UxP deputy Julia Strada.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[treslineas.com.ar](https://www.treslineas.com.ar/vuelta-casa-lidiar-consecuencias-criptogate-n-1746904.html)\n\n**Argentine President Javier Milei Impeached in Cryptocurrency Scandal**\nArgentine President Javier Milei has been formally charged by prosecutor Eduardo Taiano in the case known as 'criptogate', which investigates his alleged involvement in the scandal surrounding the cryptocurrency $LIBRA. The investigation also targets several of Milei's advisors and business associates related to the cryptocurrency, whose meteoric rise and subsequent collapse caused massive financial losses. The charges against Milei include abuse of authority, influence peddling, fraud, and bribery. The case began when Milei publicly promoted $LIBRA on social media, causing a sudden surge in its value, only to plummet hours later, devastating over 40,000 investors. Suspicions suggest that government insiders may have engaged in insider trading, benefiting a small group of electronic wallets that withdrew nearly $100 million before the collapse. Those implicated in the case include Hayden Mark Davis and Julian Peh, international promoters of $LIBRA, as well as Mauricio Gaspar Novelli and Manuel Terrones Godoy, organizers of the Tech Forum 2024 event, where the link with the president allegedly emerged. Sergio Daniel Morales, an advisor to the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Valores (CNV) director, has been accused of potential conflicts of interest. Juan Grabois, one of the accusers, urged the investigation to proceed quickly, stating, 'For national dignity, Justice must act quickly.' The prosecutor has requested information from the Banco Central, CNV, and other financial institutions to track suspicious transactions and determine if there was a coordinated scheme of fraud orchestrated by Milei's inner circle.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[lariberaweb.com](https://www.lariberaweb.com/milei-quedo-imputado-por-el-caso-libra/)\n\n**Argentina: Opposition Proposes Impeachment of President Javier Milei**\nMembers of the opposition party 'Union for the Nation' in Argentina have proposed a motion to the Argentine Congress to impeach President Javier Milei due to his promotion of a cryptocurrency scheme on social media. According to a document published by the party's bloc in the Chamber of Deputies on X, the motion aims to initiate constitutional impeachment proceedings against Milei, citing 'events that constitute grounds for political responsibility for his unsatisfactory performance of his duties.' The lawmakers accused Milei of performing his duties in an unsatisfactory manner and of abusing his powers. They also did not rule out the possibility of considering the president's actions as criminal offenses that require a court investigation. The lawmakers pointed out that, as an economist by education, and given his connections with the people who organized the project, Milei should have known that this was a scam. Before the motion can be considered by the parliamentary chamber, it must be approved by a parliamentary committee. To force the president to leave his position, the 'Union for the Nation' will need the support of the moderate opposition, which currently opposes the accountability process. Milei had published information on February 14 about a project aimed at helping small businesses in Argentina attract investment using cryptocurrencies. After a wave of criticism on social media, the president deleted the post, saying he was not aware of the project's details. However, a statement from the presidential office published on February 15 said that Milei had met with people related to the project at least twice to discuss it. After the president's initial post, the value of the cryptocurrency used in the project rose to $5 and then dropped to less than $1. A small group of cryptocurrency holders were able to make millions of dollars from the surge. After the report was published, the opposition began to accuse the president of committing crimes, including negligence, money laundering, and engaging in activities that do not align with the duties of a public official.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 03:13 AM\nSource:[mangish.net](https://mangish.net/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%AE%D8%A7/)\n\n**Argentina's Opposition Seeks to Impeach President Milei Over Cryptocurrency Scandal**\nOpposition parties in Argentina have presented separate bills to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Javier Milei for his involvement in the launch of the cryptocurrency Libra, which caused significant financial losses for thousands of people. The impeachment process is a constitutional mechanism that allows the National Congress to investigate the political responsibilities of high-ranking officials for possible crimes committed in office. The process involves the formation of a 31-member commission, the declaration of admissibility of the charges, and a vote in the Chamber of Deputies. If the charges are approved, the case will be sent to the Senate, where the president will be tried and potentially removed from office. This is the first time in recent history that impeachment proceedings have been initiated against a president in Argentina.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 11:23 PM\nSource:[Diario El Ciudadano](https://elciudadanoweb.com/criptogate-como-es-el-procedimiento-de-juicio-politico-que-impulsa-la-oposicion-dura-contra-milei/)\n\n**Adorni: The $Libra case 'does not harm the Government'**\nManuel Adorni, the presidential spokesperson, stated that the case of the cryptocurrency $Libra 'does not harm the Government' and warned that those from the opposition 'will not be able to take advantage' because 'there is no crime' for the Government. Adorni emphasized that the Government sees no wrongdoing in President Javier Milei's promotion of $Libra and highlighted that these operations are 'classic' in Argentine politics. He also criticized the kirchnerismo, whose parliamentary bloc in the Chamber of Deputies announced yesterday that it will push for a impeachment trial, calling them 'a group of delinquents' and 'sinverg\u00fcenzas'. Adorni stated that the opposition does not understand what happened in the 2023 elections, as 'the people do not want them anymore, they detest them'. He also accused the kirchnerismo of being part of 'the helicopter club', seeking an early exit for Milei from the Presidency. Adorni confidently stated that 'that will not happen' and advised them to 'keep playing with the impeachment trial and the helicopter, because the President's honesty is unshakeable'. He emphasized that the image of Milei before the public opinion has not changed 'at all', and that this is because 'people look at the low inflation rate, the growing economy, the stable dollar, and a Government without corruption'. When asked about the possibility of a successful impeachment trial, Adorni replied that 'that will not happen' and recommended that they 'keep playing with the impeachment trial and the helicopter, because the President's honesty is unshakeable'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[diariolaopinion.com.ar](https://www.diariolaopinion.com.ar/nacionales/adorni-afirmo-que-el-caso-libra-no-dania-al-gobierno-para-nosotros-no-hay-delito.htm)\n\n**Argentine President Javier Milei Faces Impeachment Over Massive Cryptocurrency Scam**\nArgentine President Javier Milei is facing a potential impeachment due to a massive cryptocurrency scam, known as $LIBRA, which he promoted on his social media platforms. The scam, which was launched in April 2024, promised investors a 50% return on investment for development in Argentina, but instead, it resulted in losses of over $4 billion for approximately 74,698 traders. The investigation, led by the US Department of Justice and the FBI, accuses Milei and other individuals of generating illicit gains of between $80 and $100 million through the scam. The President's sister, Karina Milei, is also implicated in the scandal, as she allegedly facilitated the access of two traders to the President's inner circle. Milei has denied any wrongdoing, stating that he only 'diffused' the information and did not promote the scam. However, experts have pointed out that the President's public promotion of the cryptocurrency, including including the contract address in his social media post, suggests a direct involvement. The Argentine Chamber of Deputies has initiated a process for a political trial against the President, and the Peronist coalition has filed a request for a impeachment trial.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 04:30 AM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/mundo/america/2025/02/17/javier-milei-al-borde-del-impeachment-por-presunta-criptoestafa-masiva-782000)\n\n**Argentina's President Milei Faces Impeachment Proceedings and Investigations**\nArgentine President Javier Milei is facing multiple investigations and potential impeachment proceedings for alleged cryptocurrency fraud and other crimes. While Milei's team claims he was deceived and did not act quickly enough to remove the promotional message, lawmakers are pushing for a parliamentary inquiry and potential impeachment. The process will begin in the Chamber of Deputies and end in the Senate, requiring the support of two-thirds of both chambers to proceed. Some lawmakers, such as Esteban Paul\u00f3n and M\u00f3nica Fein, have expressed concern over the gravity of the situation and called for the designation of authorities to investigate. The Coalici\u00f3n C\u00edvica (CC) has requested the creation of an investigative commission, citing potential violations of the Law of Public Ethics and the Law of Financial Entities. Meanwhile, Uni\u00f3n por la Patria is pushing for a parliamentary impeachment, arguing that Milei's involvement in the alleged crime is of 'enormous gravity' and constitutes an 'unprecedented scandal'. The Frente de Izquierda is demanding that Milei provide explanations on national television, with Nicol\u00e1s del Ca\u00f1o saying 'Will he face the music or hide like Minister Caputo?' The scandal erupted when Milei promoted the cryptocurrency $Libra on social media, which saw its value skyrocket from $0.0001 to $24.80 in just 20 minutes. The case has sparked intense debate, with some accusing the government of trying to victimize itself and others calling for Milei's resignation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 04:38 PM\nSource:[telesurtv.net](https://www.telesurtv.net/milei-podria-enfrentar-juicio-politico-comision-investigadora-o-interpelacion/)\n\n**Argentina's Congress to Consider Impeachment Motion Against President Javier Milei**\nThe Union for the Fatherland bloc in Argentina's Congress has announced plans to file a motion for impeachment against President Javier Milei, following a scandal over his promotion of a cryptocurrency on social media. The bloc claims that Milei's participation in a cryptocurrency scam is 'of enormous gravity' and 'a scandal without precedents.' However, the motion for impeachment faces a major obstacle: the Commission for Political Trial is currently without authorities due to an internal dispute within the Liberty Advances party. The Commission's president, Marcela Pagano, was voted out in April last year, and the current president of the Chamber, Mart\u00edn Menem, has refused to recognize the new authorities. As a result, the motion for impeachment will have to pass through the Permanent Commission for Political Trial, which is currently without a president. The opposition parties, including the Coalition Civic and the Radical Disidents, have instead proposed the creation of an investigative commission to look into the matter. The outcome of the motion for impeachment is uncertain, and it is likely to face significant opposition in the Senate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 04:07 PM\nSource:[El Cronista](https://www.cronista.com/economia-politica/que-posibilidades-tiene-de-avanzar-el-juicio-politico-a-javier-milei-en-diputados/)\n\n**Argentina's President Javier Milei Faces Impeachment over Cryptocurrency Scandal**\nFour political leaders filed a criminal complaint against Argentine President Javier Milei on Sunday, accusing him of 'illicit association', 'fraud', and 'failure to perform public duties'.

The complaint states that Milei was a 'necessary and fundamental' participant in the alleged scheme, which involved figures close to his circle, including Mart\u00edn Menem, the president of the Chamber of Deputies. Additionally, lawmakers from Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez's party and the Socialist Bloc have filed a motion to impeach Milei, but it is unlikely to succeed as it requires a special majority in Congress, which is unlikely to be achieved given the opposition from the Coalici\u00f3n C\u00edvica and the PRO party of Mauricio Macri.

The opposition is seeking to impeach him, with the Union for the Homeland party stating that 'Milei's participation in a crypto-related crime is of enormous gravity'. The Comisi\u00f3n de Juicio Pol\u00edtico de Diputados, with 31 members, will evaluate the admissibility of the process. The impeachment process requires a two-thirds majority in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Milei's government has been marked by conflicts with various sectors, and his viability in the face of an impeachment process depends on the composition of the Congress and the fragility of the alliances that support the officialism. 'Our block of national deputies decided to advance in the presentation of a request for impeachment against the President of the Nation,' explained the statement from the Union for the Homeland party. 'There is already a debate among the different blocks in Congress about whether there should be an investigative commission or if the impeachment is appropriate,' said Mart\u00edn Losteau, president of the UCR. Maximiliano Ferraro, a deputy from the Coalici\u00f3n C\u00edvica ARI, stated that Milei would have violated the Law of Public Ethics and the Law of Financial Entities, 'particularly in relation to advertising for the capture of resources (art. 19). The impeachment process is a constitutional mechanism by which the National Congress can remove the highest authorities of the country, including the President, the Vice President, the Chief of Staff, the National Ministers, and the judges of the Supreme Court. Its development depends on a complex political entanglement, in which legislative majorities are determinant.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Perfil.com](https://noticias.perfil.com/noticias/politica/como-es-el-proceso-para-un-juicio-politico-en-argentina.phtml)\n\n**PRO and UCR Sector Unite to Protect President Milei from Impeachment**\nThe PRO and the official sector of the UCR, led by Rodrigo De Loredo, are trying to protect President Javier Milei from a potential impeachment. The opposition's swift action to investigate the crypto scandal in the Chamber of Deputies did not resonate with the PRO and the UCR sector. The common thread among the lawmakers closest to the government was to demolish the initiative to impeach Milei, which was pushed by the Uni\u00f3n por la Patria block. 'Those who ruined Argentina are asking for impeachment. 20 years of taking everything and now they're acting like moralists and republicans. They have no shame,' wrote Cristian Ritondo, president of the macrista bloc in the Chamber of Deputies. Patricia Bullrich, the Minister of Security, also claimed that there is no crime to justify a judicial and political attack on the head of state. Ritondo was not alone in his stance, as he was joined by his friend Diego Santilli, a close ally of the President and one of the two macrista leaders in Buenos Aires who are pushing for an electoral agreement with La Libertad Avanza in the province governed by Axel Kicillof. 'Thieves think everyone is like them. I'm sorry to say, but they're wrong. They'll be left with their desire to overthrow the President,' wrote Santilli. Guillermo Montenegro, the mayor of General Pueyrred\u00f3n, also weighed in, drawing from his experience as a former federal judge. 'Now the irresponsible people who ruined the country are experts on Germ\u00e1n Bidart Campos and Elon Musk. To those who don't know the law, I say: nothing that happened constitutes a crime. They'll probably start asking for reports and calling officials just to get involved in the issue. Let them do what they want,' he replied. The radicals closest to the government, within the space led by De Loredo, are maintaining a strict silence and waiting for the official sector to take the lead. They have lowered the price for Mart\u00edn Menem, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, and believe that the opposition needs to come to an agreement before they take any action. They also think that there will be no movement in the Chamber of Deputies until March 1st.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 06:45 AM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/politica/el-pro-y-el-oficialismo-quieren-proteger-a-milei.phtml)\n\n**Support for President Milei from PRO Leaders Amidst Opposition Calls for Impeachment**\nThe mayor of General Pueyrred\u00f3n, Guillermo Montenegro, stated that President Javier Milei did not commit any crime, while the deputy Carolina P\u00edparo described the situation as 'small and miserable' for the opposition to request a political trial. Montenegro said, 'Now the irresponsible ones who ruined the country are studying Bidart Campos and Elon Musk. I tell the unknowns of the law: nothing that happened constitutes a crime.' P\u00edparo also commented, 'The president clarified the situation. But it's surprising that many take advantage of this or any situation to harm, that it delights them the idea that a government is going badly, as if that wouldn't affect us all. It's very small and miserable that desire.' The opposition bloc in the Chamber of Deputies will present a request for a political trial against Milei for promoting the cryptocurrency $LIBRA and denounced a possible 'scam' by the national president. 'Milei's participation in a crypto scam is of enormous gravity. It's an unprecedented scandal,' they considered. Meanwhile, the Frente de Izquierda (FIT) will promote a resolution project to demand Milei's presence in the Chamber of Deputies to provide 'verbal reports' about the 'scandalous promotion of a massive scam from his social media last Friday,' according to the document. On the other hand, the national deputy Diego Santilli defended Milei and criticized the kirchnerismo, saying, 'The thieves think everyone is of their same condition. I'm sorry to say they're wrong.' The national deputy of the PRO, Cristian Ritondo, also defended Milei, saying, 'Those who ruined Argentina are asking for a political trial. 20 years taking everything and now they're making themselves moralists and republicans. They have no shame.' The minister of Security, Patricia Bullrich, defended Milei, saying that 'the President is not the State' and has 'freedom of expression.' She also criticized the opposition, saying that 'what happened last night was an atomic bomb to try to bring down the President.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[eldia.com](https://www.eldia.com/nota/2025-2-16-2-29-56-respaldo-al-presidente-de-dirigentes-del-pro-politica-y-economia)\n\n**Peronist Block in Chamber of Deputies Joins Call for Impeachment Trial Against President Milei**\nThe Peronist block in the Chamber of Deputies has joined the call for a impeachment trial against President Javier Milei. The initiative, announced for Monday, follows a similar decision by the Left Front. The scandal surrounding President Milei continues to unfold, with socialist deputy Esteban Paul\u00f3n announcing plans to present an impeachment request against the President for promoting the $LIBRA token. The Peronist block in the Chamber of Deputies has now joined the initiative, stating: 'The President's participation in a cryptocurrency scam is of enormous gravity. It's a scandal without precedent.' They also announced: 'Our block of national deputies has decided to move forward with the presentation of an impeachment request against the President of the Nation.' The Left Front (FIT) is also pushing a resolution project to demand Milei's presence in the Chamber of Deputies to provide 'verbal explanations' about the 'scandalous promotion of a million-dollar scam through his social media last Friday.' They also demand that authorities 'make available all necessary resources to ensure that this interrogation is broadcast nationally, so that the entire population can hear the explanations.' The impeachment request mentions that the President 'presented the $LIBRA cryptocurrency as a tool to finance small businesses in Argentina on February 14' and 'shortly after its promotion, the value of this digital currency plummeted.' 'This event sparked suspicions of market manipulation and the use of privileged information, as the initial announcement allowed for a significant increase in its value before its collapse, generating estimated gains of several million dollars for those involved, with the support of the Argentine President,' the FIT's request argues.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 07:40 PM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/politica/2025/2/15/el-bloque-peronista-en-diputados-se-suma-al-pedido-de-juicio-politico-contra-milei-1188317.html)\n\n**Peronist Block in Argentine Chamber of Deputies Joins Call for Impeachment Trial Against President Milei**\nThe Peronist block in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies has joined the call for a impeachment trial against President Javier Milei.

Milei's international agenda has already led to his first major activity of the year, receiving and supporting the newly elected President of Venezuela, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, who is challenging Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Milei will continue to prioritize geopolitics, traveling to Washington D.C. on January 17 to attend Donald Trump's inauguration, where he will meet with Trump's team and business leaders. He will then head to Davos, Switzerland on January 21 to deliver a speech at the World Economic Forum, building on his strong message from last year's event, where he stated, 'Occidente est\u00e1 en peligro' ('The West is in danger'). This year, Milei's team expects another strong speech, saying, 'el mensaje del a\u00f1o pasado hizo mucho ruido y luego el mundo gir\u00f3' ('the message last year made a lot of noise and then the world turned'). The President will also focus on the economy, aiming to maintain the country's financial and commercial surpluses, and a stable dollar, with the goal of eventually lifting the currency controls. This is expected to boost the ruling party's performance in the upcoming legislative elections, allowing them to strengthen their blocks in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 10:45 PM\nSource:[ciudadano.news](https://ciudadano.news/politica/inicio-ano-agenda-externa-prioritaria-presidente-proyeccion-economia-n93382)\n\n**Milei Meets with Expelled Radical Deputies**\nJavier Milei, the President of Argentina, met with 13 radical deputies, including Luis Picat, Mariano Campero, and Mart\u00edn Arjol, who were expelled from the UCR party for collaborating with Milei's veto on laws related to mobility and university financing. The meeting, which lasted over two hours, took place at the Casa Rosada and was attended by other officials, including the Minister of Security, Patricia Bullrich, and the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Mart\u00edn Menem. Milei confirmed that the government will send a new 'clean slate' project to prevent people with confirmed convictions from running in elections, following the failure of a previous project. According to Rodrigo de Loredo, the head of the UCR block in the Chamber of Deputies, Milei 'reiterated the will to send the project, despite what happened last month in parliament.' De Loredo denied that a possible electoral agreement for the 2025 legislative elections or the reform of the electoral system, including the elimination of the PASO primaries, was discussed during the meeting.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 26, 2024 10:03 PM\nSource:[elocho.tv](https://www.elocho.tv/locales/milei-recibio-a-los-diputados-radicales-expulsados-97773.html)\n\n",
