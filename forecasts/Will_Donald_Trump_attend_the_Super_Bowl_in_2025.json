The President, a self-proclaimed fan of the Kansas City Chiefs, will attend the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Chiefs on February 9th in New Orleans. According to the Secret Service, 'extensive planning and coordination have been carried out to ensure the safety of all attendees, players, and staff.' The security measures have been enhanced this year due to Trump's attendance, as stated in a press release. Trump has expressed his support for the Chiefs in the past, saying, 'Congratulations. What a great team, coach, quarterback, and almost everything else, including those fantastic fans. Congratulations to the Buffalo Bills for a tremendous season. They're going to win a lot in the future!!!' When asked about the likely winner of the Super Bowl, Trump replied, 'I don't want to say, but there's a certain quarterback who seems like a good winner,' which is believed to be a reference to Patrick Mahomes. The increased security is also due to the recent attack in New Orleans on January 1st, where a man ran over dozens of people, killing 14.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 04:46 PM\nSource:[FanSided](https://fansided.com/es/donald-trump-primer-presidente-estados-unidos-asistir-super-bowl)\n\n**Donald Trump to Become First US President to Attend Super Bowl**\nUS President Donald Trump will attend Super Bowl 2025 in New Orleans on February 10 between the 'Kansas City Chiefs' and 'Philadelphia Eagles', according to CNN.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has assured that her agency has protected the event for over 20 years and is working 'around the clock' to ensure security at the Superdome in New Orleans. Noem also stated that her agency has not received any 'credible threats' to the game and has deployed 'resources in advance' to the city.

Baier asked Trump about his policies, including tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China, and the handling of fentanyl and illegal immigration. This tradition, which dates back to 2004, was previously skipped by Trump in 2018 and by Biden in 2023 and 2024. Trump was also interviewed by Sean Hannity two days after his return to the Oval Office, where he discussed topics such as Biden's pardons and the aftermath of assassination attempts against him. Trump said, 'We can get our country back.

The Caesars Superdome will open at 1:30 p.m. and attendees are advised to bring minimal items, with clear bags being the only allowed type. 2,000 law enforcement officers and 350 National Guard troops will be on patrol. Gov. Jeff Landry defended the decision to allow concealed carry in security enhancement zones, citing statistics that show areas with concealed carry are safer. Firearms are prohibited in the Superdome, and bringing drones could result in a fine of up to $7,500.

The 25% tariff on various products, including avocados, could increase the price of guacamole or even make it scarce. According to the National Agricultural Council (CNA), the new tariffs will affect Mexican exports worth over $475 billion, representing 80% of the country's shipments to the US. Products like avocados, tomatoes, chilies, and berries, which account for over 50% of Mexico's exports, may see a significant price increase for US consumers. The meat sector will also be affected, as Mexico exports around $1.5 billion worth of beef and pork to the US. Meanwhile, Mexican avocado producers are looking to diversify their markets, with the Association of Avocado Producers and Exporters of Jalisco (Apeajal) planning to strengthen exports to Asia and South America. Despite the uncertainty, avocado producers in Michoac\u00e1n and Jalisco, the only states authorized to export to the US, expect to send 110,000 tons to meet the demand for the Super Bowl 2025, similar to the amount sent in 2024. However, the entry into force of the tariffs could alter the distribution and price of the product in the US market. 'It is a challenge for us, but we are working to improve our processes, implement sustainable practices, and increase the cultivated area to ensure the supply at a global level,' said an avocado producer. 'We are not going to let this affect us, we will find a way to continue exporting and providing the best quality avocados to our customers.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 01:17 PM\nSource:[MVS Noticias](https://mvsnoticias.com/mundo/2025/2/3/sin-guacamole-para-el-super-bowl-2025-asi-afectaran-los-aranceles-de-trump-al-aguacate-en-eu-676823.html)\n\n**President Trump to Sit for Super Bowl Interview With Fox News Anchor Bret Baier**\nPresident Donald Trump will sit down for a pre-recorded interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier ahead of Super Bowl LIX.

However, the article's thesis is strained and based on a flawed analysis. Economists from the Wells Fargo Agri-Food Institute found that the price of a Super Bowl party menu for 10 people has only increased by 0.1% from last year, with broccoli and celery being cheaper options. The AP failed to mention the mass culling of poultry due to bird flu concerns, which has likely contributed to the increase in chicken wing prices. The article's attempt to blame the Trump administration's tariff policy for the high food prices is 'totally ridiculous' and a 'creative new angle to pin former President Joe Biden's failures on Donald Trump's nascent term'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 03:21 AM\nSource:[Redstate](https://redstate.com/beccalower/2025/02/01/leave-it-to-the-ap-to-find-a-way-to-blame-the-high-cost-of-americans-super-bowl-parties-on-trump-n2185096)\n\n**Super Bowl 2025: Chiefs vs Eagles, Kendrick Lamar to Perform at Halftime**\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, will face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl 2025.

The game is expected to be closely watched, not only for the football, but also for potential protests against the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency. The romance between Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, a tight end for the Chiefs, is also expected to draw attention. The Chiefs are currently favored to win, with a 1.5-point lead over the Eagles.

The Secretary of Fomento Agroalimentario and Desarrollo Rural (Sefader) of Oaxaca, V\u00edctor L\u00f3pez Leyva, said that Oaxaca and Michoac\u00e1n could benefit from the sale of avocados and Persian limes in February for the preparation of guacamole in the Super Bowl LIX. However, the subsecretary of Agronegocios, Fernando Robles, commented that, according to the regulations, agricultural products are exempt from tariffs and dumping, including tomatoes and avocados. 'We cannot promise the NFL fans that there will be guacamole for the Super Bowl LIX due to the diplomatic tensions between the two countries,' said L\u00f3pez Leyva. 'The increase in tariffs announced by Trump could change the situation,' he added. 'We are in a delicate situation, and we do not know what will happen,' said Robles. 'The tradition of enjoying guacamole during the Super Bowl is in danger,' said L\u00f3pez Leyva. 'It's a tradition that has been going on for over 13 years, and it's a shame that it could come to an end,' he added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[MVS Noticias](https://mvsnoticias.com/deportes/2025/1/25/donald-trump-sus-aranceles-el-fin-del-guacamole-en-el-super-bowl-675655.html)\n\n**Trump to visit L.A. and an NFL playoffs preview: Morning Rundown**\nPresident Donald Trump's executive order targeting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives has left federal workers feeling angry and fearful.

According to MyTopSportsbooks, a website specializing in sports betting analysis, the predictions for the show go beyond music and include aspects such as surprise elements. Fans are speculating about what surprises Lamar might bring to his performance, given his previous appearance at the Super Bowl in 2022. Some of the most popular bets include whether Lamar will mention any political or social topics, such as the recent inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States. Lamar has been known for his socially conscious lyrics, and his song 'The Heart Part 4' even referred to Trump as a 'fool.' The halftime show has come a long way since its transformation in 1991, when New Kids on the Block and Gloria Estefan marked the beginning of a new era by incorporating pop culture elements. Michael Jackson's memorable performance in 1993 set a new standard for future shows. Lamar's return to the Super Bowl stage in 2025 is generating even more expectations about how he might surpass or reinvent his previous performance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 09:52 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/las-apuestas-mas-curiosas-sobre-el-halftime-show-del-super-bowl-2025-que-ya-empiezan-a-sonar-en-eeuu-nid20012025/)\n\n**Southwest Floridians embrace D.C. inauguration despite changes**\nThousands of people, including many from Southwest Florida, have gathered in Washington, D.C. for Donald Trump's inauguration.
