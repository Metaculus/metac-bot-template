Scotland's last win in this fixture was in 2017 under Vern Cotter, while all their defeats since have been during Gregor Townsend's reign. Ireland, who kicked off their title defence with a bonus-point victory over England, are buoyed by their impressive recent record of 13 wins from their last 14 Six Nations fixtures. According to BBC, Scotland will be looking to lay down a marker in their search for a first Six Nations title. 'The Irish are seemingly unaffected by the absence of their head coach Andy Farrell, who is on British and Irish Lions duty,' said the BBC.

The first match is between Italy and Wales in Rome, where Italy is expected to be the favorite. However, Wales is determined to prove themselves and make a comeback. The second match is between England and France in London, where France is looking to bounce back from their loss to Ireland last week. England is expected to put up a good fight, but France has the stars in their lineup. The third match is between Scotland and Ireland in Edinburgh, where Scotland is looking to take advantage of Ireland's absence of their head coach Andy Farrell, who is on a British & Irish Lions mission. Scotland is expected to win with a narrow margin, according to the Edinburgh Evening News. 'It will be a tough match for Italy, they will have to work hard to win, and Wales will do everything to save their dignity. Remember, most people predicted Italy's win in Rome last year, but look what happened (17:29 in favor of Wales). Although they are the favorites now, it's hard to imagine Italy running away with a big score in this match. The hosts should win, but will it be a comfortable victory, only time will tell. And you can be sure that Wales will want to prove to many people that they were wrong.' 'France had a thrashing of the Welsh in Paris, but the trip to Twickenham is a different level, even against England, who is expected to not 'shine' on this tournament. The French will be without the disqualified Romain Ntamack. Although they have many options to compensate for this loss, it adds another name to their list of absent stars who would have otherwise been in the starting lineup.' 'It will be a thrilling match. England had some good moments in Dublin, and they earned a bonus point, but their game in the first and second half was like day and night. And it won't be unfair to say that, based on the second 40 minutes, they got lucky to finish the match with a relatively small defeat. Steve Borthwick will have to make some important changes. The match should be exciting.' 'Scotland will not get an easy win, they will have to work hard, and Wales will do everything to save their dignity.
