Trump suggested that the previous Biden administration's move to provide USD 21 million to India to 'improve voter turnout' was an attempt to 'get somebody else elected'. BJP leader Amit Malviya said that Trump's statement 'confirmed' that there was an attempt to influence the election in India. Malviya shared a clip of Rahul Gandhi speaking in London in 2023, where he can be heard saying, 'It's not just an Indian battle...In March 2023, ahead of the 2024 Lok Sabha election, Rahul Gandhi was in London, urging foreign powers -- from the US to Europe -- to intervene in India's internal affairs.' Gandhi's comments were seen as an attempt to undermine India's strategic and geopolitical interests, acting as a tool for foreign agencies. The Congress party demanded that the government should bring out a white paper detailing USAID's support to both governmental and non-governmental institutions in India.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 12:25 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/tool-for-foreign-agencies-bjp-jabs-rahul-gandhi-after-trumps-poll-meddling-claim-2682951-2025-02-20)\n\n**Trump Urges Congress to Pass New Federal Budget to Avoid Shutdown**\nUS President Donald Trump has called on Congress to pass a new federal budget to avoid a government shutdown in mid-March. Trump inherited the budget issue from the previous administration of Joe Biden, which had agreed to a temporary budget until March 14, 2025. If new funding decisions are not made by then, government operations may come to a halt. Trump wrote on social media platform Truth Social, 'The government will shut down if Congress doesn't pass a new budget.' The longest government shutdown in US history, lasting 35 days, occurred in 2018-2019 due to disagreements over funding for a border wall with Mexico. A federal budget is a financial document that outlines the financial plans of all government agencies, services, and programs.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:31 PM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/world/2180557-donald-tramp-prizval-kongress-prinjat-novyi-bjudzhet/)\n\n**Trump Offers to Help Mexico Combat Drug Cartels, Amid Trade Tensions**\nUS President Donald Trump has stated that Mexico is being run by drug cartels, a claim he made again on February 18, 2025, while also offering to collaborate with Mexico to combat them. 'It's sad to say, but if they wanted help with that, we would give it to them,' Trump said in a press conference in Miami, Florida. However, Mexico is already working with the US to combat drug cartels, with the US using spy planes and drones to monitor the cartels in Mexican territory. The US has been conducting these covert flights since the Joe Biden administration, according to CNN reports. Meanwhile, the PAN party in Mexico is pushing for a meeting between Mexican and US senators to discuss the issue of drug cartels and trade. The party's leader, Ricardo Anaya, has stated that the conflict over trade is urgent and requires immediate action. Trump has announced a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian exports, which could lead to a deep recession in Mexico's economy. The PAN party is also criticizing the use of the Mexican Congress as a recruitment center for the ruling party, Morena. The party's leader, Ricardo Anaya, has accused Morena of using the Congress as a 'module of affiliation' and has called for an investigation into the matter. Additionally, there is controversy within Morena over the affiliation of former PANista Miguel \u00c1ngel Yunes M\u00e1rquez, who was recently affiliated with the party. The governor of Veracruz, Roc\u00edo Nahle, has spoken out against Yunes' affiliation, stating that it does not represent the values of the party.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[Exc\u00e9lsior](https://www.excelsior.com.mx/opinion/francisco-garfias/la-zanahoria-y-el-garrote/1700627)\n\n**House Speaker Mike Johnson invites Trump to address joint session of Congress in March**\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has invited President Trump to address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025, marking his first chance to address both chambers since returning to office.

Trump explained when signing the executive order, 'The World Health Organization has cheated us, and everyone cheats the United States. This will not happen again.' The US Department of the Interior said on Friday that it had officially changed the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, and the Denali Peak in Alaska to Mount McKinley. Trump ordered the change of the two names as part of a series of executive actions after hours of taking office on Monday, as part of implementing his election promises.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 09:53 PM\nSource:[shahennews.com](https://www.shahennews.com/807605/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%AE%D9%81%D8%B6-%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3/)\n\n**Trump to Address Joint Session of Congress on March 4**\nUS President Donald Trump will address a joint session of Congress on March 4, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson.
