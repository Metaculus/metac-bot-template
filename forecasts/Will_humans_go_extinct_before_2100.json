Spoiler: It's Not Us**\nHomo erectus, a human ancestor that walked upright, survived for nearly 2 million years, making it the most successful human species of all time. It spread across the planet, learning to make hand axes and possibly using fire and building boats. However, it eventually went extinct in Java due to climate change, as it was unable to adapt to the changing ecosystem. This raises questions about our own ability to survive and adapt to the current climate crisis, as we are not far off the terminal age reached by other human species. As Dr. [no expert is quoted in the article], said, 'H. erectus simply didn't have the smarts to adapt to this new habitat and wasn't capable of updating its toolkit to meet the challenges posed by such drastic ecosystem alterations.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 04:51 PM\nSource:[IFLScience](https://www.iflscience.com/which-human-species-survived-for-the-longest-spoiler-its-not-us-77775)\n\n**The Blood that Killed the Neanderthals: How Genetic Incompatibility Contributed to Their Extinction**\nScientists have discovered that Neanderthals had a rare Rh-null antigen, which may have contributed to their extinction. When early modern humans left Africa, their red blood cells may have evolved quickly to adapt to new conditions, but this adaptation may have contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals. According to Stephan Mazure, the lead author and population geneticist, Neanderthals had a rare Rh-null antigen that was incompatible with early Homo sapiens and Denisovans. This incompatibility likely caused hemolytic disease in newborns during interbreeding, leading to severe anemia or death in Neanderthal offspring. Although modern medicine can treat Rh incompatibility, 100,000 years ago such conditions would have been fatal, which may have accelerated the extinction of Neanderthals. The study also found that modern human Rh variants originated from early Homo sapiens, who likely developed them shortly after migrating out of Africa. This adaptation may have occurred on the Iranian plateau, where environmental pressure and population growth led to rapid changes in red blood cell diversity. In contrast, Neanderthals and Denisovans showed limited diversity, likely due to isolation and inbreeding, which may have further contributed to their extinction.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 04:44 PM\nSource:[focus.ua](https://focus.ua/uk/technologies/690197-krov-shcho-vbila-neandertalciv-yak-genetichna-nesumisnist-vplinula-na-rozvitok-lyudstva)\n\n**Homo erectus: The First Masters of Survival in Arid Environments**\nA new study published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment reveals how Homo erectus, one of the earliest human ancestors, learned to survive in arid environments. Researchers from an international group of anthropologists focused on the Engare Sero site in Tanzania, where 1.2-1 million years ago, semi-arid conditions prevailed. The study found that Homo erectus used water sources, created innovative tools, and demonstrated adaptability to extreme conditions. 'Homo erectus was able to adapt to various ecosystems, not just in Africa, but also in Eurasia,' said the researchers. This discovery challenges the previous theory that only Homo sapiens could adapt to extreme conditions. The study highlights the importance of Homo erectus in human evolution, showing that the ability to adapt to the environment is key to survival. 'This data helps us better understand the evolutionary processes that made it possible for modern humans to appear,' the researchers noted. According to the study, Homo erectus appeared around 2 million years ago in Eastern Africa and went extinct around 100-400 thousand years ago. It was the first species to master upright walking and adapt to harsh conditions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 03:09 PM\nSource:[pravda.ru](https://www.pravda.ru/news/science/2166061-homo-erectus-adaptation/)\n\n**Neanderthal Blood Group May Have Contributed to Their Extinction**\nResearchers have discovered that Neanderthals had a rare blood group that was incompatible with modern humans and Denisovans, which may have contributed to their extinction. The study, published in Scientific Reports, found that Neanderthals had a unique Rh blood group that was not compatible with the Rh blood group of modern humans and Denisovans. This incompatibility could have led to a high risk of hemolytic disease in newborns, which could have been fatal. The researchers suggest that this may have contributed to the decline and eventual extinction of the Neanderthal population. 'Neanderthals had a very rare Rh blood group that was not compatible with the Rh blood group of modern humans or Denisovans,' said St\u00e9phane Mazi\u00e8res, the lead author of the study. 'If a Neanderthal woman had a child with a modern human or Denisovan man, the risk of hemolytic disease in the newborn would have been very high.' Mazi\u00e8res added that this could have been a contributing factor to the extinction of the Neanderthal population.

The study, published in Earth arXiv, found that severe drought caused by climate change may have led to a decline in the population of the dwarf elephant and the 'Hobbit' people that hunted them. The 'Hobbit' people, also known as the Flores people, were thought to have gone extinct around 12,000 years ago due to volcanic eruptions and competition with larger humans. However, recent research suggests that they actually went extinct around 38,000 years ago, with modern humans appearing around 4,000 years later. Michael Gagan, a researcher from the University of Wollongong, said that there is a lack of evidence for catastrophic volcanic activity. Gagan and his team collected rock samples from a cave where the 'Hobbit' people once lived, and analyzed the ratio of magnesium and calcium, as well as different oxygen isotopes, to gain insights into the historical seasonal rainfall patterns. The results showed that the average annual rainfall in the region decreased by 38% between 76,000 and 55,000 years ago, and was 51% drier than it is today around 56,000 years ago. Gagan said that the reduction in summer rainfall may have led to conflicts over scarce water resources, and that the two species may have become more vulnerable once they left their native habitat and encountered modern humans. Michela Leonardi from the University of Cambridge said that the findings are reasonable, as water supply is the main driver of human and animal changes. 'We know that life would be very difficult without water,' she said. Leonardi added that while the 'Hobbit' people showed remarkable adaptability, the climate change event happened too quickly for any life-saving mutations to occur.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 01:24 PM\nSource:[\u79d1\u5b66\u7f51](https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2025/1/538027.shtm)\n\n**More than 40% of the world's languages may disappear, warn scientists**\nScientists from the Australian National University (ANU) have found that the world is facing a significant threat of language extinction. According to their research, more than 40% of the approximately 7,000 existing languages are at risk of disappearing. The researchers predict that the number of languages that have already stopped being used could increase fivefold in the next 80 years, leading to a complete loss of more than 20% of all languages by 2100. Language extinction can occur suddenly, due to natural disasters, or gradually, due to social and economic changes. As some languages become more prestigious and in demand, they displace others, leading to the loss of minority languages. This trend causes significant damage to cultural heritage, as languages carry traditions, historical memory, and unique worldviews. The researchers warn that even actively used languages today may disappear in the coming decades, resulting in not only linguistic loss but also the loss of knowledge and cultural wealth accumulated over generations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https://news.day.az/unusual/1723257.html)\n\n**Giant Animals Lived Among Humans for Millennia in South America**\nA recent study, led by paleontologist F\u00e1bio Henrique Cortes Faria, has challenged the long-held belief that the megafauna of South America went extinct shortly after the end of the Pleistocene era, around 11,700 years ago. Through radiocarbon analysis of fossils from species such as Eremotherium laurillardi (a giant sloth), Notiomastodon platensis (a South American elephant), and Smilodon populator (a saber-toothed tiger), the team found that many of these animals survived for thousands of years longer than previously thought. Some species, like Palaeolama major and Xenorhinotherium bahiense, which are related to modern llamas, lived until around 3,500 years ago, during the Holocene era, long after the arrival of the first humans in the continent. Cortes Faria explained, 'Humans certainly had a role, but the extinction of the megafauna in South America seems to have been mainly driven by environmental changes.' The study suggests that the expansion of forests and the contraction of savannas, which reduced habitats for many species, was the main driver of extinction. However, the authors also acknowledge that humans likely contributed to the decline and extinction of the megafauna, particularly through hunting and habitat modification.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 11:11 AM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/kodami/i-bradipi-giganti-e-altri-animali-estinti-della-megafauna-hanno-vissuto-accanto-agli-esseri-umani-per-millenni/)\n\n**Study Reveals Alarming Decline in Handwriting Skills Among Generation Z**\nA recent study from the University of Stavanger in Norway has revealed alarming results showing that approximately 40% of Generation Z, born between the late 1990s and early 2000s, are losing their handwriting skills, a fundamental ability that has been a crucial part of human interaction for over 5,500 years. The study highlights the rapid changes in individual behavior, which is believed to be primarily caused by the extensive use of social media and the internet. According to a report by news9live, the technology has left a deep mark on daily life, particularly in the way we communicate with others. However, for Generation Z, who grew up in a completely digital environment, the boundaries between the real and virtual worlds have become blurred, leading to significant and profound changes in their communication methods. The study found that handwriting, which was once a key part of human interaction, is now facing the risk of extinction, as the internet, particularly social media platforms, has changed the concept of writing. The study notes that the changes are not limited to informal communication, but also extend to educational institutions, where the increasing reliance on technology in education has replaced traditional handwriting with digital notes and electronic content, reducing the opportunities for practicing handwriting and leading to its gradual decline. Research suggests that handwriting plays a crucial role in developing fine motor skills and stimulating memory in children. However, the nature of social media, which prioritizes speed and brevity, does not allow for the development of these skills. While rapid communication through text messages or emoticons may seem suitable in some situations, these habits do not compensate for traditional communication skills. The study warns that continuing this trend may have negative consequences for future generations, leading to a decline in social and communication skills, and weakening education's ability to develop creativity and expression. The study urges educational institutions and internet platforms to take immediate action to address this issue before it becomes irreversible.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 10:53 AM\nSource:[alsiasi.com](https://alsiasi.com/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D9%81%D9%82%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84-z-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A9/)\n\n**Early Humans May Have Coexisted with Giant Sloths for 10,000 Years**\nNew research suggests that early humans in America may have coexisted with giant sloths for at least 10,000 years, contrary to the previous theory that they rapidly hunted and wiped out these massive creatures. The findings, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, include evidence of human-made tools and fire pits found near the remains of giant sloths in Brazil's Santa Elina archaeological site, which dates back to around 27,000 years ago. This discovery challenges the long-held narrative that early humans arrived in America around 15,000 years ago and quickly hunted and wiped out the megafauna. 'We used to think that humans came and everything was rapidly wiped out,' says Daniel Odess, an archaeologist at the White Sands National Park in New Mexico. 'But now we're seeing that humans and these giant sloths coexisted for at least 10,000 years and didn't wipe them out.' The research also suggests that early humans may have used the giant sloths' bones as tools or decorations, and that they may have even cooked their meat. 'We're finding evidence of humans making these tools and using them to process the sloth bones,' says M\u00edrian Pacheco, a researcher at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. 'It's a very different story than we thought.' \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 06:44 AM\nSource:[arkeofili.com](https://arkeofili.com/dev-tembel-hayvan-binlerce-yil-insanlarla-birlikte-var-olmus/)\n\n**Population Collapse: Is (Western) Human Extinction Near?**\nItaly, a birthplace of Western civilization, is experiencing a decline in births, with a fertility rate of 1.2 children per woman. This is not unique to Italy, as many Western European countries are facing low fertility rates. According to Elon Musk, by 2100, Europe will have lost 117 million people. The decline in births is a worldwide phenomenon, with over three-quarters of countries expected to have low fertility rates by 2050 and 97% by 2100. This has negative consequences, including a shrinking workforce, economic instability, and a burden on pension systems. As Mark Steyn said, 'The future belongs to those who show up for it.' Westerners are showing up less than most other peoples, and this may lead to a mass extinction of Western culture. Remedies include the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence and robotics, but this is uncharted territory.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 03:55 PM\nSource:[thenewamerican.com](https://thenewamerican.com/us/culture/population-collapse-is-western-human-extinction-near/)\n\n**Dr. Samir Hamamah: 'We are in the midst of a demographic winter and if we don't act, humanity may disappear'**\nAccording to Dr. Samir Hamamah, a leading expert in reproductive medicine, the world is experiencing a 'demographic winter' and if left unchecked, humanity may face extinction.

His findings are alarming, as he predicts that one-third of all living species may become extinct by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. Urban's study shows that the current rate of climate change is putting immense pressure on species that cannot control their environment like humans do, making them vulnerable to extinction. According to Urban, if global temperatures rise by 5.4\u00b0C by the end of the century, it is likely that one-third of all species will become extinct. He also notes that some groups of species, such as amphibians, are more vulnerable to extinction than others.

According to biologists, Mark Urban, the analysis shows that human activities are increasing atmospheric and ocean temperatures, leading to extreme heat and weather events that disrupt ecosystems and threaten species' survival. The study found that species' ability to adapt and survive depends on their location and ability to adapt to environmental changes. The results suggest that if global temperatures rise by 5.4 degrees Celsius, one-third of species may become extinct. The study also found that certain groups of species, such as amphibians, are at a higher risk of extinction.

The study, led by biologist Mark Urban, analyzed data from 485 previous research studies and over five million projections, and found that species living in vulnerable regions, such as mountainous, island, and freshwater ecosystems, are among the most threatened. According to Urban, the study's conclusions 'reinforce with greater certainty' that extinctions will accelerate if global temperatures exceed 1.5\u00b0C, and that higher emission scenarios could have catastrophic consequences. The study not only highlights the magnitude of the problem, but also delves into its causes and projections. It found that species with limited dispersal capabilities or those living in restricted areas are at greater risk. 'This work synthesizes the advances made in the last decade in ecological modeling, allowing for a more realistic and detailed analysis of the threats,' explain the researchers. The study identifies certain critical points of biodiversity that face disproportionate risks, including South America, Australia, and New Zealand, which are particularly vulnerable. The study also warns that the impact of these losses will extend beyond individual species, affecting other species, including humans, and will have global repercussions, including chain extinctions that could destabilize entire ecosystems. 'The climate crisis is contributing increasingly to the proportion of global extinctions observed since 1970,' the report highlights. This phenomenon is not only a future problem; it is already happening and increasing 'at a worrying rate.' The study's conclusions underscore the need for drastic and urgent measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Urban and his colleagues emphasize that limiting global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C is essential to keep extinction threats below 2%. However, even under more optimistic scenarios, biodiversity losses would be significant. A 5% reduction in global extinction, projected in a moderate emission scenario, would still be devastating for ecosystems and the people who depend on them. 'The impact of these losses will extend beyond individual species, affecting other species, including humans,' warn the scientists. The study also highlights the importance of prioritizing the conservation of highly threatened species, such as amphibians, island ecosystem species, and those already classified as critically endangered. According to the report, efforts should focus on the 'most immediate extinction debts'; that is, species facing an imminent loss of viability. The study also emphasizes that extinction represents only the final stage of a long process of decline. Even before reaching this point, many species experience significant reductions in population and area, weakening their ecological role and often putting other species they interact with at risk. To address this crisis, the study underscores the need to create more advanced predictive models, including biological factors, such as species interactions and demography. Because, although models have improved in the last decade, they still have limitations, especially when it comes to rare or poorly known species, which are often the most vulnerable. The study's findings not only reinforce the gravity of the climate crisis, but also pose a fundamental choice for humanity: act now to mitigate the impacts or face a future with irreversible consequences for biodiversity and the ecosystems that sustain life on Earth. 'The greatest certainty about the predicted extinctions due to climate change obliges us to act,' as each degree of warming avoided can 'make the difference between survival and extinction for thousands of species,' conclude the researchers.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 10, 2024 11:30 AM\nSource:[informacion.es](https://www.informacion.es/medio-ambiente/2024/12/10/alerta-cientifica-tercio-especies-extinguirse-112487072.html)\n\n**Scientists Warn of Mass Extinction: One-Third of Species at Risk by 2100**\nScientists have warned of the danger: up to 2100, one-third of species may become extinct.

The study, which analyzed over 30 years of research on biodiversity and climate change, found that even if emissions are kept under 1.5\u00b0C, the risk of extinction is not significantly increased. However, if temperatures rise to 2.7\u00b0C, which is expected under current international emissions commitments, 1 in 20 species could be threatened with extinction.

However, rising temperatures to 2.7\u00b0C 'speeds up the process.' The study found that species in South America, Australia, and New Zealand face the greatest threats, with amphibians being the most threatened due to their dependence on weather patterns and sensitivity to changes in rainfall and drought.

The study found that species in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, particularly amphibians, are among the most threatened. The study's author, Mark Urban, warns that to avoid accelerating extinctions due to climate change, we must prevent global temperatures from rising above 1.5\u00b0C. Urban notes that the current global temperature increase (above 1.3\u00b0C) puts 1.6% of species at risk, which increases to 2.7% in a scenario where the global temperature increases by 2\u00b0C, and up to 30% in a worst-case scenario where the temperature increase is 5.4\u00b0C. The study highlights the importance of identifying priority species for conservation and protecting them until the global temperature trajectory can be reversed. 'Extinction is just the end of a species' existence. Even when extinction is avoided, the decline in abundance and reduction in distribution area can strongly affect many other species, including humans,' the study concludes.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 05, 2024 07:50 PM\nSource:[Publico](https://www.publico.pt/2024/12/05/azul/noticia/accao-climatica-20-especies-terra-estar-risco-2100-2114420)\n\n**A third of Earth's species could become extinct by 2100 if climate change isn't curbed**\nA new study finds that almost a third of Earth's species could be at risk of extinction by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise.
