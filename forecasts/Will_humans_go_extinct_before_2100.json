    "question": "Will humans go extinct before 2100?",
    "description": "While the general feeling of most people, especially now that the cold war is (mostly) over, is that the risk of human extinction is extremely small, experts have assigned a significantly higher probability to the event.\n\nIn 2008 an [informal poll at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at the University of Oxford](https://www.webcitation.org/6YxiCAV0p?url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/gcr-report.pdf) yielded a median probability of human extinction by 2100 of 19%. Yet, one might want to be cautious when using this result as a good estimate of the true probability of human extinction, as there may be a powerful selection effect at play. Only those who assign a high probability to human extinction are likely to attend the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in the first place, meaning that the survey was effectively sampling opinions from one extreme tail of the opinion distribution on the subject. Indeed, the conference report itself stated that the findings should be taken 'with a grain of salt'.",

According to the United Nations, the global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, but the growth rate is slowing down. The world's population is expected to peak at 10.4 billion by 2100, but then decline to 10.9 billion by 2100. The main factors contributing to the decline in population are the expansion of access to birth control, improvements in women's education, and a decrease in fertility rates. Some countries, such as Japan, Spain, and Italy, are expected to see a significant decline in population, while others, such as Africa south of the Sahara, are expected to see a tripling of their population. By 2100, the number of people over 65 is expected to exceed the number of people under 20. The global fertility rate is expected to decline from 4.6 births per woman in 2017 to 1.7 by 2100. The UN has warned of the potential economic and social impacts of a declining population, including pressure on social systems and the need for governments to be proactive in addressing the issue.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 10:49 PM\nSource:[waradana.com](https://waradana.com/article/197936-%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%89-%D8%AF%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%83)\n\n**Cities at Risk of Disappearing by 2100 Due to Climate Change**\nAccording to research from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, there is a 90% probability that the global sea level will rise by 0.5 to 1.9 meters by 2100 if carbon dioxide emissions continue to increase. This could lead to the disappearance of several cities, including those from Calais, Denmark to Venice, Italy. The NTU's predictions are based on various methods to model climate processes, including the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers. As the UN states, human interactions have been the main driver of climate change, primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which release greenhouse gases and trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to rising global temperatures. 'The consequences of climate change are no longer science fiction,' said the UN. 'We are seeing the devastating effects of climate change unfold before our eyes.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 08:25 PM\nSource:[heraldodemexico.com.mx](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/mundo/2025/1/28/estas-son-las-ciudades-que-podrian-desaparecer-para-2100-por-el-cambio-climatico-671900.html)\n\n**Human Extinction Countdown Reaches Record Low of 89 Seconds**\nThe countdown to human extinction has reached a new record low of 89 seconds, according to the 'end-of-the-world clock' released by a US-based organization.

He tweeted, 'Worth a try. Something needs to change or Europe and Asia (and most of Earth) will disappear!' Musk, who has 11 children with three women, is actively working to prevent human extinction. According to a report by 'The Lancet', by 2050, more than three-quarters of the world's countries and territories (155 out of 204) will no longer have a sufficient birth rate to ensure normal population replacement. By 2100, this problem is expected to occur in 198 countries and territories, with 54% of the world's births occurring in Africa south of the Sahara desert. To ensure population replacement, the total fertility rate needs to be approximately 2.1, but 'The Lancet' predicts a rate of 1.8 by 2050 and 1.6 by 2100. Only six countries (Chad, Niger, Samoa, Somalia, Tajikistan, and Tonga) are expected to have a rate above 2.1 by the end of the century, while 13 countries will have a rate below 1.0. Western Europe is expected to have a rate of 1.44 by 2050 and 1.37 by 2100.\nOriginal language: lv\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 02:39 PM\nSource:[jauns.lv](https://jauns.lv/raksts/arzemes/639032-ilons-masks-prognoze-divu-kontinentu-izmirsanu)\n\n**Elon Musk Predicts Extinction for Europe and Asia if Birth Rates Don't Increase**\nElon Musk has predicted that Europe and Asia will face extinction if humanity fails to increase birth rates.

According to the British publication Express, the research team found footprints that appear to have been made by four different individuals, of different shapes and sizes, on a surface of volcanic ash that has been preserved for 350,000 years. Despite some voices questioning the findings as 'vague conclusions', the research suggests that the footprints, known as Ciampate del Diavolo (Devil's Footprints), provide evidence of the species' physical characteristics.

According to a recent analysis of over a dozen studies, current climate policies are likely to result in a global warming of between 1.9 and 3.7\u00b0C by 2100, with the possibility of continued increase in the 22nd century. Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Stripe, notes that every year we continue to emit more carbon dioxide beyond 2100, global temperatures will continue to rise. Most studies reviewed by Hausfather conclude that, if we continue as we are, the most likely warming will be between 2.3 and 3\u00b0C by the end of the century. However, including uncertainties about future human emissions and how the climate system will respond to them, the range expands to between 1.9 and 3.7\u00b0C. There is also a small but concerning possibility of warming reaching 4.4\u00b0C if we do not make significant changes. The good news is that the probabilities of the worst-case scenarios \u2013 such as more than 4\u00b0C of warming before 2100 \u2013 are now much lower. This is due to two factors: on the one hand, some of these extreme scenarios were never entirely realistic, and on the other, progress in reducing emissions has contributed to limiting the growth of the use of fossil fuels like coal. However, we cannot rely on current trends being enough. If climate policies are strengthened and technological innovations continue to exceed expectations, future emissions could be reduced even further. However, there are risks associated with emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI). Hausfather warns that the rapid growth of AI could increase energy demand and emissions in the short term. However, he does not believe that the impact of AI will be sufficient to significantly alter the outcome by the end of the century, although it could make it more difficult to quickly reduce emissions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 11:50 AM\nSource:[eldiario.es](https://quo.eldiario.es/naturaleza/cambio-climatico/q2501096077/el-mundo-se-puede-calentar-hasta-37-grados-mas-para-2100)\n\n**Population Collapse: Is (Western) Human Extinction Near?**\nItaly, a birthplace of Western civilization, is experiencing a decline in births, with a fertility rate of 1.2 children per woman. This is not unique to Italy, as many Western European countries are facing low fertility rates. According to Elon Musk, by 2100, Europe will have lost 117 million people. The decline in births is a worldwide phenomenon, with over three-quarters of countries expected to have low fertility rates by 2050 and 97% by 2100. This has negative consequences, including a shrinking workforce, economic instability, and a burden on pension systems. As Mark Steyn said, 'The future belongs to those who show up for it.' Westerners are showing up less than most other peoples, and this may lead to a mass extinction of Western culture.

His findings are alarming, as he predicts that one-third of all living species may become extinct by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced. Urban's study shows that the current rate of climate change is putting immense pressure on species that cannot control their environment like humans do, making them vulnerable to extinction. According to Urban, if global temperatures rise by 5.4\u00b0C by the end of the century, it is likely that one-third of all species will become extinct. He also notes that some groups of species, such as amphibians, are more vulnerable to extinction than others.

According to biologists, Mark Urban, the analysis shows that human activities are increasing atmospheric and ocean temperatures, leading to extreme heat and weather events that disrupt ecosystems and threaten species' survival. The study found that species' ability to adapt and survive depends on their location and ability to adapt to environmental changes. The results suggest that if global temperatures rise by 5.4 degrees Celsius, one-third of species may become extinct. The study also found that certain groups of species, such as amphibians, are at a higher risk of extinction. Additionally, the study notes that the extinction of small species can have a ripple effect, putting larger species that depend on them at risk.

The study, led by biologist Mark Urban, analyzed data from 485 previous research studies and over five million projections, and found that species living in vulnerable regions, such as mountainous, island, and freshwater ecosystems, are among the most threatened. According to Urban, the study's conclusions 'reinforce with greater certainty' that extinctions will accelerate if global temperatures exceed 1.5\u00b0C, and that higher emission scenarios could have catastrophic consequences. The study not only highlights the magnitude of the problem, but also delves into its causes and projections. It found that species with limited dispersal capabilities or those living in restricted areas are at greater risk. 'This work synthesizes the advances made in the last decade in ecological modeling, allowing for a more realistic and detailed analysis of the threats,' explain the researchers. The study identifies certain critical points of biodiversity that face disproportionate risks, including South America, Australia, and New Zealand, which are particularly vulnerable. The study also warns that the impact of these losses will extend beyond individual species, affecting other species, including humans, and will have global repercussions, including chain extinctions that could destabilize entire ecosystems. 'The climate crisis is contributing increasingly to the proportion of global extinctions observed since 1970,' the report highlights. This phenomenon is not only a future problem; it is already happening and increasing 'at a worrying rate.' The study's conclusions underscore the need for drastic and urgent measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Urban and his colleagues emphasize that limiting global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C is essential to keep extinction threats below 2%. However, even under more optimistic scenarios, biodiversity losses would be significant. A 5% reduction in global extinction, projected in a moderate emission scenario, would still be devastating for ecosystems and the people who depend on them. 'The impact of these losses will extend beyond individual species, affecting other species, including humans,' warn the scientists. The study also highlights the importance of prioritizing the conservation of highly threatened species, such as amphibians, island ecosystem species, and those already classified as critically endangered. According to the report, efforts should focus on the 'most immediate extinction debts'; that is, species facing an imminent loss of viability. The study also emphasizes that extinction represents only the final stage of a long process of decline. Even before reaching this point, many species experience significant reductions in population and area, weakening their ecological role and often putting other species they interact with at risk. To address this crisis, the study underscores the need to create more advanced predictive models, including biological factors, such as species interactions and demography. Because, although models have improved in the last decade, they still have limitations, especially when it comes to rare or poorly known species, which are often the most vulnerable. The study's findings not only reinforce the gravity of the climate crisis, but also pose a fundamental choice for humanity: act now to mitigate the impacts or face a future with irreversible consequences for biodiversity and the ecosystems that sustain life on Earth. 'The greatest certainty about the predicted extinctions due to climate change obliges us to act,' as each degree of warming avoided can 'make the difference between survival and extinction for thousands of species,' conclude the researchers.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 10, 2024 11:30 AM\nSource:[informacion.es](https://www.informacion.es/medio-ambiente/2024/12/10/alerta-cientifica-tercio-especies-extinguirse-112487072.html)\n\n**Scientists Warn of Mass Extinction: One-Third of Species at Risk by 2100**\nScientists have warned of the danger: up to 2100, one-third of species may become extinct.

However, rising temperatures to 2.7\u00b0C 'speeds up the process.' The study found that species in South America, Australia, and New Zealand face the greatest threats, with amphibians being the most threatened due to their dependence on weather patterns and sensitivity to changes in rainfall and drought.

The research analyzed 450 studies over 30 years of biodiversity and climate change data, finding that exceeding the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels would sharply accelerate extinction rates. Species reliant on specific habitats, such as amphibians, are most vulnerable, with warming-induced changes in temperature and precipitation altering habitats and disrupting species interactions. If emissions align with the Paris Agreement, 1 in 50 species (approximately 180,000) could still be at risk by 2100, but under current international commitments, the risk increases to 1 in 20 species. The study emphasizes the importance of limiting emissions to reduce these risks and calls for targeted conservation efforts in the most vulnerable ecosystems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 06, 2024 05:52 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/science/a-third-of-earth-s-species-could-vanish-by-2100-unless-climate-change-is-stopped-article-12884646.html)\n\n**One in 20 species at risk of extinction by 2100 due to climate change**\nA study published in the journal Science estimates that 1.8% of species on Earth are at risk of extinction, even if the Paris Agreement is met, which aims to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. If we continue on our current emissions trajectory, one in 20 species will be at risk by 2100. The study found that species in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, particularly amphibians, are among the most threatened. The study's author, Mark Urban, warns that to avoid accelerating extinctions due to climate change, we must prevent global temperatures from rising above 1.5\u00b0C. Urban notes that the current global temperature increase (above 1.3\u00b0C) puts 1.6% of species at risk, which increases to 2.7% in a scenario where the global temperature increases by 2\u00b0C, and up to 30% in a worst-case scenario where the temperature increase is 5.4\u00b0C. The study highlights the importance of identifying priority species for conservation and protecting them until the global temperature trajectory can be reversed. 'Extinction is just the end of a species' existence. Even when extinction is avoided, the decline in abundance and reduction in distribution area can strongly affect many other species, including humans,' the study concludes.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 05, 2024 07:50 PM\nSource:[Publico](https://www.publico.pt/2024/12/05/azul/noticia/accao-climatica-20-especies-terra-estar-risco-2100-2114420)\n\n**A third of Earth's species could become extinct by 2100 if climate change isn't curbed**\nA new study finds that almost a third of Earth's species could be at risk of extinction by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. The study, published in the journal Science, analyzed over 30 years of biodiversity and climate change research and found that species in mountain, island, and freshwater ecosystems, as well as those in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, are most at risk. If global temperatures rise to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above the pre-industrial average temperature, exceeding the target of the Paris Agreement, extinctions would rapidly accelerate. Study author Mark Urban said, 'If we keep global warming to below 1.5 C, in accordance with the Paris Agreement, then the [extinction] risk from today to 1.5 C is not a large increase.' However, at a 2.7 C rise, the trajectory accelerates, and species in South America, Australia, and New Zealand face the greatest threats. Limiting greenhouse gas emissions can slow warming and halt these growing extinction risks, but understanding which species and ecosystems are most affected by climate change can also help target conservation efforts where they're needed most.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2024 07:05 PM\nSource:[livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/planet-earth/climate-change/a-third-of-earths-species-could-become-extinct-by-2100-if-climate-change-isnt-curbed)\n\n",
