In contrast, Israel is viewed as a 'threat' by an increasing number of countries. The report, titled 'Polar Multiplicity', was released on Monday, ahead of the 61st Munich Security Conference to be held on Friday. The survey, which covered various countries including Germany, the US, the UK, France, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Canada, India, China, and South Africa, showed that the views on Turkey, South Korea, Poland, and the UK have become more positive. In all countries surveyed except France, the percentage of people who view Turkey as an 'ally' is higher than those who view it as a 'threat'. The gap between those who view Turkey as an 'ally' and those who view it as a 'threat' is 28 points in the UK and Japan, 26 points in China, 25 points in India, 19 points in South Africa, 14 points in the US and Canada, 10 points in Brazil, 5 points in Italy, and 2 points in Germany. Turkey has become the second country, after South Korea, to record the highest number of positive opinions in this area, along with the UK, Brazil, and Poland. In contrast, the US and Israel are among the countries that have suffered the most in terms of their 'allies' image, with the percentage of people who view Israel as a 'threat' increasing rapidly compared to the previous survey. Israel is the only country viewed as a 'threat' by an increasing number of countries in the survey.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:25 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86%D8%AE-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%86%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B0-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7/3478417)\n\n**Trump gets high approval ratings for his first weeks, new CBS poll finds**\nA new CBS News/YouGov poll found that 53% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's overall job in office so far, with most respondents describing him as 'effective,' 'focused,' 'tough,' 'competent,' and 'energetic.'

They noted that the relationship between the two communities is often driven by events, such as the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, and that there is a need to improve the relationship. 'I think it\u2019s largely driven by events post-October 7,' Jedwab said. 'The issue arising from that is, you know, is there something that needs to be done to try to improve that relationship?'

The survey also found that among the minority of Israelis who did not support the plan, only 13% opposed it because they considered it immoral. Among Israeli Jews specifically, the number who oppose the ethnic cleansing of Gaza for moral reasons is just 3%. As the author notes, 'if that's not a sign of a morally sick society, I don't know what is.' The author argues that this lack of empathy is a natural consequence of the systematic indoctrination of Israelis to view Palestinians as less than human, which is necessary for the existence of the State of Israel. The author also cites a 2011 survey that found that 61% of Israeli men do not consider rape to be a violation if it is committed by a known person, and that only 7% believe that marital rape is real.

The survey also found that 86% of Arab citizens are in favor of helping civil volunteer efforts in the war between Israel and Hamas, while 70% declare themselves part of Israel and its problems. Professor Mouna Maroun, vice-president and dean of research at the University of Haifa, stated: 'I am an Arab Israeli (...) I am embarrassed. And the blame is on Hamas, (...) For the sake of humanity, I implore the Arab community to move forward and intelligently and responsibly understand the Jewish narrative, as we have asked them to understand our narrative for 75 years. For the first time, as a minority Arab, we are asked to be empathetic and understand the narrative of the majority... ' Maroun added: 'In the city of Haifa, there are neighborhoods and residential buildings inhabited by Arab Israelis and Jews. At the university, Jews and Arabs learn and grow together. This is the paradigm that Israel must replicate to overcome the tragedy of October 7.' The survey also found that the percentage of Arab citizens in Israel who identify with Israel is increasing, with 66% in favor of a Arab party joining the Israeli government coalition. Fahima Abbas, a researcher at the Adva Center, stated: 'Hospitals, where many people experience pain and illness, are also places of cooperation between Jewish and Arab doctors. It is our duty to remember and strengthen this cooperation in both normal and emergency situations.' The article concludes that Arab Israeli leaders who continue to act against the interests of their own people are causing harm to their constituents, making them appear as a 'fifth column', an internal enemy. The article also mentions that at least 23 Arab Israeli citizens were killed by Hamas terrorists during the October 7 attack or by missile attacks launched by the organization in the following days. Many Bedouin men and women were also kidnapped by Hamas.

The survey also found that women, soldiers, Arabs, and evacuees are at a higher risk of experiencing psychological trauma. Professor Yossi Levi-Belz, the head of the Center for the Study of Suicidality and Psychiatric Disorders at the Ruppin Academic Center, said, 'The organism and psyche are struggling to cope with what they have experienced, which is expressed in impatience, difficulties with concentration, strong stress, and an inability to truly enjoy something. Citizens feel like their life has stopped.' The survey also found that 55.1% of respondents reported physical symptoms such as pain in the stomach or back, 51.3% reported headaches, and 34.6% reported shortness of breath or rapid heartbeat. Many respondents also reported a decline in their work performance. The survey suggests that the Israeli population is still experiencing a high level of anxiety and depression, with 25.6% of respondents reporting anxiety, 22.6% reporting post-traumatic stress disorder, and 29% reporting depression. However, the survey also found that the level of depression and anxiety has decreased since the start of the war, and that the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder have also decreased. Professor Levi-Belz emphasized the need for accessible mental health treatment, saying, 'We must express this problem in words, tell about the complexity of functioning, deal with difficulties, and return to normal.

The majority of Israelis (73%) believe that the government's actions are insufficient to combat anti-Semitism and anti-Israeli sentiments worldwide. However, the survey also found areas where Israelis are more optimistic. The level of pessimism in society has decreased, with 61% of respondents expecting a deterioration in life in Israel in the coming months, down from 71% six months ago. This indicates a growing resilience and faith in the possibility of improving the situation. However, this optimism does not extend to personal safety, with only 29% of Israelis feeling secure, a figure unchanged since the previous survey in June 2024. The survey also highlighted the deep-seated divisions and tensions between Jews and Arabs in Israel, with only a third of respondents believing in the possibility of peaceful coexistence. Despite this, two-thirds of Israelis still believe that the country has the potential to become a united society, despite the ongoing discussions about national unity and cohesion. The survey also showed that ideological polarization is increasing, with 89% of Israelis agreeing that the war and its consequences have deepened ideological divisions, and nearly half of the respondents noting a shift to the right in the political and social discourse. However, there is a positive trend in relations with the diaspora, with more Israelis (43%) reporting a growing connection with Jews around the world, compared to 35% in June 2024. However, a significant portion of the population (38%) believes that relations are deteriorating. The survey also found that a majority of Israelis (56%) believe that Israel is successfully conducting its policy of deterrence since the start of the war on October 7. This reflects the collective determination of the country to protect its borders and maintain security in the face of growing threats. However, it is clear that the landscape of Israeli national security remains complex, and its ability to cope with challenges will require continued vigilance and strategic diplomacy. Despite the challenges facing Israel, the survey results also offer a reason for optimism. The resilience and unity of Israeli society are undeniable, even amidst ideological differences and external threats. There is a growing desire for change and growth, and a foundation for change is evident. The problems facing Israel are enormous, but they are not insurmountable. With continued efforts and a resolute commitment to dialogue, unity, and security both within and outside the country, the State of Israel can pave the way for a stronger and safer future for all its citizens. In this complex reality, the resilience of Israeli society offers hope that even the darkest times will give way to brighter days. The sun is already peeking through the clouds, and the society is feeling a sense of optimism that the future may be brighter than the recent past. This is an important moment to capture the positive momentum and precisely this is what we, as a society, must recognize.

The poll also showed that a majority of Israelis support the resignation of the Chief of Staff, Herzi Halevi, and the head of the 'Shin Bet' agency, Ronen Bar, due to harsh criticism of their performance, particularly after the October 7th attack. The Likud party, led by Netanyahu, has seen a decline in popularity, with 25 seats in the current poll, down from 26 in a previous poll. In contrast, former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who is running as an independent candidate, is expected to win 24 seats, making him the largest party. The poll also showed that Bennett is preferred by 38% of respondents to lead the government, compared to 35% who prefer Netanyahu. In other matchups, Netanyahu was preferred by 39% to Bennett, 29% to Gantz, and 40% to Ya'ir Lapid. 46% of respondents believe that Halevi and Bar should resign, while 28% oppose this, and 26% are unsure. 77% of respondents support the establishment of an independent committee to investigate the intelligence and security failures that led to the October 7th attack. 70% of respondents also support holding new elections as soon as the current war ends, considering the current political situation to be unsuitable for the government to continue. The poll also showed that 64% of Israelis believe that Netanyahu's government is 'not good', with 48% describing it as 'very bad', and 16% as 'not good'. In contrast, 30% believe that the government is 'good', with 9% considering it 'very good'. Regarding the impartiality of the investigations conducted by the Attorney General's office into Netanyahu's judicial files, 44% of respondents believe that the investigations are influenced by political considerations, while 33% believe they are professional. 23% are unsure.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 29, 2024 11:30 PM\nSource:[dostor.org](https://www.dostor.org/4908344)\n\n**INSS Survey: Israelis' Confidence in IDF and Military Operations**\nA recent survey conducted by the National Security Studies Center (INSS) found that the majority of Israelis (74.5% in the representative Israeli sample, 85% among the Jewish public, and 34% among the Arab public) have high confidence in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The survey also found that there is a slight increase in confidence in the Air Force (77% in the general sample, 87% among the Jewish public, and 37% among the Arab public) and the Intelligence Corps (61% in the general sample, 68% among the Jewish public, and 31% among the Arab public) compared to the previous survey in September 2024. However, there is a slight decrease in confidence in the Chief of Staff (46% in the representative Israeli sample, 52% among the Jewish public, and 22% among the Arab public) compared to the previous month. The survey also found that the majority of Israelis (65%) are confident that the IDF will win the war in Gaza, and 52% believe that the objectives of the war will be achieved to a large extent. Additionally, 68% of Israelis believe that the war will end with the release of all hostages, and 45% are concerned about the implications of the recent developments in Syria on Israel's national security. The survey also found that 59.5% of Israelis believe that the Israeli military operations in Syria have contributed significantly to the fall of the Assad regime. Furthermore, 45% of Israelis support the Israeli position that the IDF should maintain control over the disarmed area and Mount Druze until a new government is formed in Syria. The survey also found that 54% of Israelis oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state, and 30% support it under certain conditions. The survey was conducted by the INSS in December 2024 and had a sample size of 804 Jewish and 205 Arab respondents.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 24, 2024 02:12 PM\nSource:[natourcenters.com](https://natourcenters.com/%D9%85%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%AB-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A-inss-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8/)\n\n**Arab Israelis Show Increased Support for Two-State Solution and Inclusion in Israeli Government**\nA recent survey by the University of Tel Aviv reveals a surprising trend: 57.8% of Arab Israelis, including Muslims, Druze, and Christians, believe that the ongoing war has contributed to a 'sense of shared destiny' with the Jewish community. This result, part of a study by the Moshe Dayan Center, marks a significant change from the past. In June 2024, 51.6% of respondents expressed a similar opinion, while in November 2023, just after the October 7 attacks, 69.8% believed that the war had damaged solidarity between the two communities. The war in Gaza seems to have sparked a new reflection on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict solution. Almost half of Arab Israelis (49.7%) now consider the two-state solution, based on the 1967 borders, the most realistic option, a significant increase from 17.2% in 2023. Meanwhile, pessimism decreases: only 27.1% believes that there are no political solutions in sight, compared to 55.6% last year. 'Before the October 2023 events, the majority of Arab Israelis believed that there was no practical political solution,' the report states. 'Today, the two-state solution is seen as the most realistic alternative.' Crime is the top concern, with 66.5% of respondents identifying it as the most urgent challenge, surpassing other priorities such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (10.9%) or poverty (4.9%). 'The growing violence, fueled by decades of government neglect and the proliferation of organized crime groups, has left many Arab communities in a state of insecurity,' the study's authors warn. 65.8% of respondents declare feeling insecure in their daily lives. Feeling Israeli: Arab Israeli identity is consolidating, with 33.9% indicating citizenship as the dominant component of their identity, followed by religious affiliation (29.2%) and Arab identity (26.9%). Only 9% considers Palestinian identity the core of their affiliation. Inclusion of Arab parties in the Israeli government enjoys broad support: 71.8% of respondents are in favor of this option, and almost half (47.8%) supports Arab party participation regardless of coalition orientation. The change is attributed to the experience of the Ra'am party, which supported the Bennett-Lapid coalition in 2021, setting a precedent for Arab Israeli politics. No to Hamas: Over half of Arab Israelis (53.4%) see a normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia as a positive opportunity, even without a preliminary resolution of the conflict with Palestinians. Only a minority (6.7%) supports Hamas continuing to govern Gaza, while other options \u2013 including Palestinian Authority involvement or multinational entities \u2013 gather significant consensus.

According to the 'Walla' website, there was a significant increase in the percentage of those who describe the general situation in 'Israel' as bad or very bad, with around 48% saying they feel that way. On the other hand, there was an increase in the percentage of those who describe the situation in 'Israel' as good or very good, with 19% and 32% respectively. The Israeli army is the most trusted institution, with a 77% trust rate in the sample in October 2024. The Prime Minister comes second with a 38% trust rate. The police trust rate increased after the October 7, 2023 events, but decreased significantly last year from 55% to 37%. The Supreme Court trust rate remained largely unchanged. Only about a quarter of the Israeli public trusts the government, and 16% trust the Knesset. A majority of the Jewish public (around 56%) is optimistic about Israel's future, while the Arab public has the opposite view, with around 59% being pessimistic. In a similar division, around 77% of the Arab public believes that the future of democracy is at risk, while the percentage in the Jewish public is 54%. Between May and October, there was a decrease in the percentage of those who believe that strengthening the military power will ensure a safer future for 'Israel' on the short term, from 40% to 30%, while there was an increase in the percentage of those who believe that a political settlement will ensure their safety more, from 19% to 28%.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 17, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[alahednews.com.lb](https://www.alahednews.com.lb/article.php?id=77395&cid=114)\n\n",
