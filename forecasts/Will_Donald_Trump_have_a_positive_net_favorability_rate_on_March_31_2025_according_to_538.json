According to data collected by Morning Consult between January 21 and 27, 2025, approval and disapproval rates vary significantly from country to country. Narendra Modi of India leads the list with 75% approval, followed by Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico with 66%. However, 6% of respondents in India and 7% in Mexico expressed no clear opinion about their respective leaders. Modi's disapproval rate is 19%, while Sheinbaum faces 26% disapproval. In Argentina, Javier Milei has 65% approval, but 30% of respondents disapprove. In Europe, Karin Keller-Sutter of Switzerland has 56% support, with 24% of people without an opinion and 20% disapproving. In the US, Donald Trump remains a polarizing figure with 52% approval, 10% of respondents without an opinion, and 38% disapproving. In Australia, Anthony Albanese has 46% approval, but 42% of citizens disapprove. In the Netherlands, Dick Schoof maintains moderate approval, with disapproval close behind. Similar situations are seen in Poland, where Donald Tusk faces higher disapproval than approval. In Italy, Giorgia Meloni faces a complicated situation with higher disapproval than approval. In Sweden, Ulf Kristersson is in a similar situation, with high levels of disapproval, while in South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa also experiences majority disapproval. Other leaders, such as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, also face significant disapproval. In Spain, Pedro S\u00e1nchez is marked by high disapproval rates, despite having considerable support. In Scandinavian countries like Norway and the UK, disapproval rates remain notably high, reflecting widespread discontent.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[Diario La Rep\u00fablica](https://www.larepublica.co/globoeconomia/conozca-cuales-son-los-indicadores-de-aprobacion-de-24-lideres-mundiales-en-2025-4058077)\n\n**Trump's approval ratings: What the latest polls show**\nPresident Donald Trump's approval ratings have improved significantly since his second term began. According to FiveThirtyEight polling averages, Trump's net favorability rating has narrowed from 8.6 percentage points underwater on Election Day to 0.6 percentage points underwater. When evaluating his performance as president, Trump has a 49% approval rating and 44% disapproval rating nationally. This is a significant improvement from his ratings in February 2017, when he had a 44% approval rating and 48% disapproval rating. However, Trump's numbers still lag behind those of his two Democratic predecessors, President Joe Biden and President Barack Obama, at this point in their presidencies. Trump's favorability rating varies significantly by state, with him being most popular in deep-red states and least popular in solid blue states. Interestingly, Trump's favorability rating is underwater in six of the seven 'swing states' he won last November, suggesting that these voters may have been motivated more by opposition to Democrats than by strong support for Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 09:14 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3591228)\n\n**Americans are wary of Trump\u2019s Gaza plan. Plus, politics is hell**\nA recent YouGov survey found that 47% of Americans oppose the US taking ownership of the Gaza Strip, while 22% support the idea. Despite this, President Donald Trump's net favorability rating is -0.6 percentage points, but his net job approval rating is +5.6 points. Americans seem to like some of Trump's policies, such as mass deportations and limiting gender-affirming care for minors, but dislike him personally. A Gallup survey found that half of the 14 politicians or Trump-aligned figures asked about had net-negative favorability, including Trump himself. The survey also found that 73% of Americans oppose Trump using the government to investigate and prosecute his enemies. Americans are generally unhappy with politics and politicians, with 22% of registered voters feeling hopeful about the direction of the nation, 17% feeling scared, 14% feeling depressed, and 15% feeling angry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[dailykos.com](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2025/2/8/2302095/-Americans-are-wary-of-Trump-s-Gaza-plan-Plus-politics-is-hell?pm_campaign=front_page&pm_source=top_news_slot_1&pm_medium=web)\n\n**Trump's numbers are weak**\nDonald Trump's approval ratings are weak, with 49.8% approval and 42.8% disapproval, or a net +7.0, making him the second-least popular president in his first week in office. This is similar to his ratings in 2017, when he had 44.6% approval and 41.4% disapproval, or a net +3.2. In contrast, Joseph Biden had an initial net rating of +21.8, while Barack Obama had +46.9. Half of all Americans expect Trump to be a 'poor' or 'terrible' president. Americans also lack confidence in Trump's appointments, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Kash Patel as Federal Bureau of Investigation director, Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, and Pete Hegseth as secretary of defense. Additionally, Americans generally reject Trump's handling of immigration, with a majority opposing his proposals to deport undocumented immigrants, use active duty military to find undocumented immigrants, and separate families during deportation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 09:02 PM\nSource:[Inquirer](https://opinion.inquirer.net/180669/trumps-numbers-are-weak)\n\n**Public Anticipates Changes With Trump but Is Split Over Whether They Will Be Good or Bad**\nA Pew Research Center survey conducted from January 27 to February 2, 2025, among 5,086 adults found that 47% of Americans approve of Donald Trump's job performance, a higher rating than at any point during his first term. However, his post-inauguration approval rating is lower than that of most other presidents dating back to Ronald Reagan. The survey also found that 55% of Republicans say GOP congressional leaders do not have an obligation to support Trump's policies if they disagree with him. Republicans are upbeat about Trump's actions and agenda, but Democrats find little to like. The public is split on whether Trump will be a successful president, with 35% saying he will be successful and 31% saying it is too early to tell. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans are satisfied with the way things are going in the country, while just 12% of Democrats are satisfied. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[pewresearch.org](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/02/07/public-anticipates-changes-with-trump-but-is-split-over-whether-they-will-be-good-or-bad/)\n\n**Trumpilocks: A New Era for the US Economy?**\nMany investors are betting on Donald Trump, but some experts warn of a shift in the market sentiment. Benoit Anne, an expert at MFS Investment Management, says, 'This time is over.' He believes that the US economy is moving into a new macroeconomic regime, which he calls 'Trumpilocks.' The Federal Reserve may pause its monetary policy easing due to strong US growth and persistent inflation. Investment banks have reduced their expectations for further interest rate cuts in 2025. Vanyo Walter from RoboMarkets says, 'Two interest rate cuts of 0.5 points in 2025 are the highest of the feelings, if the underlying data remains the same.' However, most analysts believe that the US economy is not yet at its peak. The US economy is still growing well and behaving as if it is in the middle of the cycle. MFS experts warn of the risk of overheating. Projections from the Federal Reserve banks in Atlanta and New York indicate a 3% economic growth rate for the fourth quarter of 2024. This would be a positive sign for US stocks and growth titles. However, there are still uncertainties, especially in the first quarter. Apple, for example, is seen as skeptical by some analysts due to high valuation ratios and is trading at $225, the same price as when Trump took office. Carsten Mumm from Donner & Reuschel is more optimistic, believing that Trump's aggressive approach will boost the mood of many companies. He expects a rising production rate in the service sector and industry. The outcome of the upcoming earnings season will depend on the tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, and Amazon. The 'Magnificent 7' are expected to drive the market with a predicted profit growth of around 20%, while the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to contribute only a 3% growth rate.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 01:27 PM\nSource:[finanzen.net](https://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/zertifikate/benjamin-feingold-kolumne-trumpilocks-wird-trump-es-schon-richten-14217994)\n\n**Voters Rate Trump More Aggressive on Trade Policy**\nA recent Rasmussen Reports survey found that 48% of Likely U.S. Voters rate Donald Trump as doing a good or excellent job of handling trade issues, with 34% giving him excellent marks.

US President Donald Trump stated that there is 'no problem' regarding the retaliatory tariffs imposed by China on some US-imported goods. Trump also mentioned that he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at an appropriate time, but is not in a hurry. In Japan, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) board member Naoki Tamura suggested that the BoJ should raise interest rates by at least 1% until the end of the second half of the fiscal year, which starts in April. Analysts noted that inflation and wage growth in Japan are gaining strength and are now the main economic concerns. As a result, the Nikkei 225 index in Japan rose 0.6% to 39,054, while the Kospi index in South Korea increased 1.1% to 2,536. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.9% to 20,781, the Shanghai Composite index in China rose 1.2% to 3,266, and the Sensex index in India fell 0.4% to 77,977.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 07:07 AM\nSource:[Milliyet](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/uzmanpara/asya-borsalarinda-pozitif-seyir-hakim-7300580)\n\n**Global Markets Show Positive Trend Amid Uncertainty**\nThe global markets are showing a positive trend due to the decrease in uncertainty about the US government's economic and trade policies. Today, attention is focused on the Bank of England's (BoE) interest rate decision. The world economy is navigating the inflation-recession dilemma, and the news flow about US President Donald Trump's economic and trade policies is being closely followed. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a recent interview that the Trump administration wants to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Bessent stated, 'We will reduce inflation, reduce regulations, and reduce taxes. Our goal is to make these permanent.' Bessent also emphasized that the Trump administration's focus on reducing borrowing costs is on the 10-year US Treasury yield, rather than the Federal Reserve's (Fed) reference short-term interest rate. Bessent noted that the dollar is not an alternative reserve currency, and other countries may try to take this status from the US, but there is no other reserve currency in sight. Bessent also made statements about the additional tariffs, stating that Trump's tariff plans aim to bring manufacturing back to the US. Analysts believe that Bessent's statements may signal that there will be no disagreement between the Fed and the government on monetary policy in the coming period. According to the data released yesterday, private sector employment increased by 183,000 in January, exceeding market expectations. The data showed that employment, especially in the service sector, continued to be strong, while the manufacturing sector weakened, which raised concerns about its impact on economic growth and inflation. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Service Sector Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for January fell 1.2 points to 52.8, below market expectations. The index, which indicates a slowdown in service sector growth, was revised to 52.9 by S&P Global. The US trade deficit also increased by 24.7% in December, reaching $98.4 billion, the highest level since March 2022. The country's trade deficit is expected to increase by 17% in 2024 compared to the previous year, reaching $918.4 billion, the second-largest deficit since 1960. Fed officials continue to make statements, with Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin saying that he expects more interest rate cuts this year, but also noting the uncertainty about the Trump administration's policies on tariffs, immigration, and regulations. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that ignoring the potential inflationary effects of tariffs would be a mistake. Goolsbee stated that if inflation remains high or low, the Fed will face a difficult situation in determining whether it is caused by tariffs or the economy overheating. In the corporate sector, Nvidia's shares rose 5.4% after the company announced that its Blackwell platform-based artificial intelligence data center has gone into full production. With the US earnings season ongoing, investors are following Amazon and Eli Lilly's earnings announcements today. The 10-year US Treasury yield opened at 4.43% today, while the dollar index rose 0.2% to 107.7. Gold prices rose 0.7% to $2,863 per ounce, while Brent crude oil prices rose 0.2% to $74.6 per barrel. The S&P 500 index rose 0.39%, the Nasdaq index rose 0.19%, and the Dow Jones index rose 0.71% in the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. US index futures started the day positively. In Europe, the markets showed a mixed trend yesterday, and today's attention is focused on the BoE's interest rate decision and BoE Governor Andrew Bailey's statement. Analysts expect the BoE to cut its policy rate by 25 basis points today. They noted that the UK's consumer inflation rate, which fell to 2.5% in December, is close to the BoE's target of 2%, allowing for monetary easing. On the other hand, the news flow about the Trump administration's planned additional tariffs on the European Union is still in the spotlight. Yesterday, the DAX 40 index in Germany rose 0.37%, the FTSE 100 index in the UK rose 0.61%, the FTSE MIB 30 index in Italy rose 0.38%, and the CAC 40 index in France fell 0.19%. Asian markets showed a positive trend, with the risk appetite supported by the lack of aggressive trade tensions between the US and China. The news that the US and China are not taking a more aggressive stance on trade tensions and that the dialogue channels are open has reduced concerns. However, BoJ Governor Naoki Tamura stated today that the BoJ should raise its interest rates by at least 1% in the second half of the current fiscal year. Analysts noted that inflation and wage growth in Japan are gaining momentum and are now the main economic agenda items. This development has shifted the focus of economic management to macroeconomic stability. With this news, the Nikkei 225 index rose 0.6%, the Kospi index in South Korea rose 0.8%, the Shanghai Composite Index in China rose 0.7%, and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 0.5. The BIST 100 index in Turkey closed the day 0.89% lower at 9,719.81. The dollar/TL rate fell 0.1% to 35.9072 yesterday, and today it is trading sideways at 35.9150. Analysts stated that today's attention will be focused on the weekly and bank statistics in Turkey, as well as the BoE's interest rate decision in the UK, Germany's factory orders, the eurozone's retail sales, and the US's weekly jobless claims. They noted that technically, the BIST 100 index is supported by 9,700 and 9,650 points, while 9,800 and 9,850 points are resistance levels.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 06:05 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/ekonomi/kuresel-piyasalar-pozitif-seyrediyor/3473378)\n\n**Trump is at his most popular after whirlwind start to second term**\nPresident Donald Trump has seen a slight increase in his favorability rating since winning the November election, with 48.8% of voters having a favorable impression of him, compared to 47.9% who view him unfavorably. This gives him a net positive score of 0.9 points, his highest ever score. However, he still has the lowest favorability rating of any newly inaugurated president since 1953. A recent poll by DailyMail.com/J.L. Partners found that 39% of respondents had developed a more positive view of Trump during the past two months, with reasons including 'country', 'president', and 'America'. Those with a less positive view cited Trump's actions, including his deportation policies and his targeting of certain countries, with some using the word 'felon' to describe him. As J.L. Partners cofounder James Johnson said, 'More voters than is usual in our polarized system do seem to have genuinely rallied around him as he was inaugurated and, going by the popularity of his initial acts -- especially deportation of illegal migrants -- that's no surprise.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 04:50 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14359407/donald-trump-polls-favorability.html)\n\n**Trump Approval Rating Looks Fragile at Start of Second Term**\nDonald Trump's approval rating has been consistently low throughout his presidency, with a personal net favorability ratio of minus 24 percent on the day of his election in 2016. His job-approval numbers have never been above 50 percent, and he left office with a 38.6 percent/57.9 percent ratio. Despite a slight improvement in his current standing, with a 49.1 percent positive and 43.9 percent negative job-approval average, individual polls show varying results, with Gallup's January 2025 poll showing Trump at 47 percent positive and 48 percent negative. Trump's personal favorability remains low, with a 46.4 favorable and 48.0 unfavorable ratio. In comparison, Joe Biden's job-approval average was 53.8 percent positive and 33.4 percent negative at a similar point in his presidency. As Trump faces a public backlash against a poorly executed federal funding freeze and potential upcoming fights over congressional budget decisions, his popularity may continue to decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[nymag.com](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-approval-rating-start-second-term.html)\n\n**Dems' Favorability Underwater By 26 Points While Trump Enjoys Net Positive Rating, Poll Shows**\nA new Quinnipiac poll shows that the Democratic Party has a net unfavorable rating of -26, with only 31% of respondents having a favorable view and 57% having an unfavorable view.

Trump's rising popularity is attributed to a uniform shift in attitudes among every demographic group, except people aged 65+, where his favorable percentage has declined by only 1 point. Even Democrats now rate Trump better than they did before the election. However, it is unclear whether this is a permanent shift or a temporary 'honeymoon period' for the president-elect. Some experts suggest that Trump's ratings may fall once he assumes office and starts enacting policies, while others propose that the increase in popularity may be an illusion due to changes in survey methodology or respondent demographics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 06:26 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/538/trump-popular/story?id=117620918)\n\n**Has Trump Crossed the Streams?**\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, Donald Trump may have become more popular than unpopular for the first time in his political life. Trump's net-positive favorable rating has increased since Election Day, with a recent poll showing a +2 favorability among all adults and a +1 among registered voters. This trend is also seen in RealClearPolitics, which aggregates polls without weighting. Trump's increased popularity may be due to the public's fatigue with media and Democrat criticism, or the collapse of the cover-up around Joe Biden's presidency and cognitive decline. Biden's job approval numbers have declined precipitously, with a net-unfavorable -17.8 in FiveThirtyEight. Trump will assume office as a reasonably popular figure, despite the media headwinds.

According to the RCP average, Trump's favorability rating is 49.4%, while his unfavorability rating is 47.4%. This marks a significant shift from his past, when his unfavorability rating often surpassed his favorability rating. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich has described Trump's comeback as 'mythic', saying 'there's no practical way that you can explain Trump within a normal political structure.' Trump's favorability rating has been rising sporadically since December 2022, but he has finally broken through the 45% threshold. 'If you're a relatively sophisticated leader around the world, and you watch nine years of the rise of Donald Trump, and you watch two impeachments, and you watch all of these efforts to catch him in the law, and you watch two assassination attempts and the guy just keeps coming, \u2014 as I said the other day, this is a mythic figure, almost like the various Scandinavian Beowulfs and other kinds of sagas,' Gingrich said. 'There's no practical way that you can explain Trump within a normal political structure.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[hannity.com](https://hannity.com/media-room/trump-flying-high-president-elects-favorability-rating-tops-unfavorability-rating-in-rcp-average-for-first-time/)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Honeymoon With Voters Is Sweeter the Second Time Around**\nDonald Trump's favorability ratings have improved since the 2024 election, with 50% of voters holding favorable views of the president-elect, compared to 47% who view him unfavorably. This net favorability rating is Trump's best since April 2017, driven by improvements among independents and Democrats. Trump's popularity among Black voters has increased by 20 percentage points since 2016, with 36% now holding favorable views. The incoming president is also more popular among America's youngest voters, who are increasingly racially and ethnically diverse, with 51% holding favorable views. However, Trump's honeymoon period may be tenuous, as voters may not pay close attention to him until he's back in the Oval Office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2024 05:00 AM\nSource:[morningconsult.com](https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/donald-trump-favorability-rating-december-2024)\n\n",

Since 2015, he has generally had a negative net favorability rating, particularly during and after his presidency. According to 538, his net favorability was negative throughout much of his tenure in office and the subsequent years due to divisive policies and rhetoric, with transient spikes related to specific events. Given this historical tendency, I would initiate this forecast with a base rate of 20% chance that he achieves a positive net favorability by March 31, 2025. This reflects a low probability, based on past patterns where only significant positive public achievements or shifts in public perception have improved his ratings temporarily.",
