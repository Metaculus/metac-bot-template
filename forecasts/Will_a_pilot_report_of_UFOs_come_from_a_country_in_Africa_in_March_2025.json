He criticized the ufology media environment, calling it a 'snake pit', and warned against spreading unverified stories. Dr. Greer, a seasoned scientist, has consistently called out disinformation attempts, aiming to prevent a mix of truth and falsehoods from misleading the public and influencing government proceedings. He warns that such narratives could be manipulated to serve broader agendas, like fostering a global 'alien threat' perception.

The total lunar eclipse will occur on March 13th and will be visible in most of the Western Hemisphere. It will start at 21:57 hours (Central Mexican Time) and will be visible as a 'blood moon' in many parts of the world, including Asia, Australia, Africa, North America, South America, and the Pacific, Atlantic, Arctic, and Antarctic Oceans. The eclipse will end at 4:00 hours on March 14th. A partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29th, but will only be visible in a few regions of the Northern Hemisphere, such as Europe, Northern Asia, North and West Africa, and Northwest Canada. According to experts, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters the Earth's shadow, which can shorten or block some of the sunlight reflected by the Moon. A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon blocks the sunlight from reaching the Earth, while a partial solar eclipse occurs when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are not perfectly aligned, causing a small part of the Sun's surface to appear dark. These events are relatively rare and can be observed from the night side of the Earth.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 07:57 PM\nSource:[ViveUSA.mx](https://www.viveusa.mx/destinos/estos-son-los-eclipses-que-habra-en-marzo-de-2025-cuando-donde-y-como-verlos/)\n\n**Two Astronomical Events in March 2025: A Total Lunar Eclipse and a Partial Solar Eclipse**\nIn March 2025, there will be two astronomical events: a total lunar eclipse on March 21 and a partial solar eclipse on March 29. The partial solar eclipse will be visible in areas such as Europe, North Africa, and North Russia, but not in Argentina. According to astronomer, 'the eclipse will start at 8:50 local time and reach its maximum at 10:47, ending at 12:43.' It is essential to take precautions when observing the solar eclipse, as looking directly at the Sun can cause permanent eye damage. 'Los eclipses are unique opportunities to observe natural phenomena that do not occur frequently,' and they provide a chance for people worldwide to connect with the universe and science. With proper precautions, both events can be enjoyed safely.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[Ambito](https://www.ambito.com/informacion-general/marzo-traera-dos-eclipses-uno-visible-la-argentina-n6120106)\n\n**Asean News Headlines at 10pm on Wednesday (March 5, 2025)**\nThe Asean region saw a variety of news headlines on March 5, 2025.

The eclipse will be visible to the naked eye, but using telescopes or binoculars will provide a better viewing experience. During the total eclipse, the Moon will take on a characteristic reddish hue, known as a 'Blood Moon'. This coloration is caused by the refraction of sunlight through the Earth's atmosphere, similar to the way sunsets appear red on Earth. The last total lunar eclipse occurred in November 2022, and the next one will occur in March 2026. The best viewing conditions will be in areas with clear skies and low light pollution, such as rural areas in the United States and countries in South America like Argentina, Chile, and Brazil.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 10:17 AM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/sociedad/2025/3/5/la-luna-de-sangre-regresa-donde-cuando-ver-el-eclipse-total-de-marzo-1192182.html)\n\n**African Women in Politics - A Decisive Summit for the Future of Women's Leadership**\nThe 2025 Summit on Women's Political Leadership in Africa, scheduled for March 8th, aims to promote women's representation in governance and decision-making positions across the continent.

Jake Barber, a government contractor, claims to have flown helicopters on covert missions to gather alien technology. He described flying 150 feet above an 'egg-shaped' object devoid of any engine or thermal signatures, saying, 'I saw an egg, a white egg.' This is the latest report of UAPs (unidentified anomalous phenomena) that the Pentagon admits they're actively scrutinising - adding this case to 21 others. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) received 757 cases of UAP encounters from US authorities, including 272 incidents which occurred prior to 2023 but had never been reported publicly. Investigative journalist Ross Coulthart pointed out that AOIMSG's new director, Dr. Jon T.

The object passed just 10 feet beneath his aircraft's wing at 20,000 feet in controlled airspace near Los Angeles. According to the leaked audio, Troy 21 radioed air traffic control, saying, 'This is going to sound weird, but I just had something pass underneath my wing. Maybe a football-sized object right under my wing.' The object was detected on the jet's air-to-air system and radar approximately 60 miles away, leading experts to question whether it was a conventional drone or aircraft. Ben Hansen, a former FBI agent, noted that the speed and altitude made a drone explanation unlikely, saying, 'It would have exceeded Mach 2 in two minutes.'

The FBI has also confirmed that it has a special unit dedicated to investigating UFO sightings. Barber's claims have been corroborated by other witnesses, including a former Navy pilot who claims to have seen a UFO while on a mission. The US government has been criticized for its handling of UFO sightings, with some accusing it of covering up the truth. A former NASA employee has come forward with claims that the agency has been aware of UFOs for decades, but has been silenced by the government. The issue of UFOs has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that it is a national security issue, while others believe that it is a matter of public interest. The Russian Academy of Sciences has also been involved in the search for extraterrestrial life, with a giant radio telescope in Karachay-Cherkessia capable of detecting signals from millions of light-years away. Scientists are searching for exoplanets similar to Earth, and have discovered 18 potential candidates. The search for extraterrestrial life is an ongoing effort, with scientists using a variety of methods to search for signs of life, including the detection of biosignatures in the atmospheres of exoplanets. While there is currently no conclusive evidence of extraterrestrial life, scientists remain hopeful that one day they will find evidence of life beyond Earth. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 03:54 PM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.Ru // \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd](https://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2877807/)\n\n**CAF Announces New Format for CAN U17 2025, Tunisia and Algeria Reprieved**\nThe Confederation of African Football (CAF) has announced a new format for the 2025 U17 African Cup of Nations (CAN U17 2025) to be held in Morocco from March 30 to April 19.

He stated, 'Something is moving at hundreds of kilometers per hour underwater, as big as a football field.' Burchett, who has previously claimed that the US government is hiding evidence of extraterrestrial life, said that the information came from an admiral, whom he did not identify. He stated that the incident was documented and reassured the American public, saying, 'I'm not worried about getting hurt. I mean, with those capabilities, they would have grilled us a long time ago.' The Pentagon released a report in March 2024 stating that it had no evidence of UFOs and that many mysterious sightings were actually weather balloons, spy planes, satellites, and other normal activities.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 10:22 AM\nSource:[lacapitalmdp.com](https://www.lacapitalmdp.com/estados-unidos-congresista-republicano-afirma-que-existe-una-nave-submarina-extraterrestre/)\n\n**US Representative Claims Navy Admiral Told Him of Extraterrestrial Ships Moving Underwater**\nUS Representative Tim Burchett recently mentioned in an interview that a Navy Admiral told him that there are extraterrestrial ships moving underwater at incredible speeds. Although the UFO topic has been ridiculed in the past, the US Congress has been increasingly taking reports of mysterious unidentified flying objects seriously. According to a report by Agence France-Presse, Representative Burchett told former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, who hosts a show on the right-wing media outlet One America News Network, 'They told me that there's something underwater moving at hundreds of miles per hour... it's as big as an American football field.' Burchett emphasized that this incident is documented and was told to him by a Navy Admiral, but he did not reveal the Admiral's identity. Burchett is known for claiming that the US government is hiding UFO and extraterrestrial activity, and he believes that anything is possible in the vast universe. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that intelligent life exists outside of Earth. Despite this, the US Congress is increasingly taking reports of mysterious flying objects seriously, turning the once-mocked UFO topic into a serious issue. The US Department of Defense released a report in March 2024 stating that it found no evidence of UFOs and that many reported sightings were actually of weather balloons, spy planes, satellites, and other normal activities.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 02:06 AM\nSource:[ETtoday\u65b0\u805e\u96f2](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20250125/2899057.htm)\n\n**'Smooth, Shiny' Spheres 'Came Right At' NASA Astronaut Flying Over Texas**\nNASA astronaut Leroy Chiao reported seeing two 'smooth' and 'shiny' orbs flying above Houston, Texas while flying his private plane at 9,000 feet in 2023. The orbs, each around three feet in diameter, sped by him around 20 feet away from his plane and had 'no visible means of propulsion.' Chiao, a highly accomplished pilot and space traveler, claimed that the orbs 'came right at me' and that he was at a loss for any explanation. He attributed the technology to the American military, saying 'what the hell are they doing flying it where airplanes are operating?'

    "summary": "After considering historical data and recent developments, the experts revised their probabilities for a pilot report of UFOs from a country in Africa in March 2025. Most experts started with a low initial probability, typically around 5-10%, due to historically infrequent reports from Africa compared to other regions. Factors such as increased global awareness of UFOs and improvements in reporting infrastructure were seen as potentially increasing the likelihood. However, cultural stigma and infrastructural challenges were noted as significant barriers to reporting. In the second phase, despite increased global discourse on UFOs, there was no specific evidence of increased pilot reports from Africa. Revised probabilities varied, with most experts slightly raising their estimates to 10-25%, while a few maintained a lower likelihood closer to their initial estimates. Overall, the consensus suggested a moderate increase in probability, yet still acknowledging considerable challenges for such reports from Africa.",
