Hungarian designer Erno Rubik created the first prototype in 1974, which he later patented as the 'magic cube'. The cube's mechanism allows for rotating blocks to achieve a single color on each face. Initially, Rubik took a month to solve his invention, but the record has since been broken with a time of 3.13 seconds. The cube has been to the stratosphere and the deepest ocean, and has been used in extreme expeditions to explore creativity and learning. With 43 trillion possible variations in each cube, it's no wonder that 450 million have been sold worldwide. The book 'El Cubo de Rubik's' tells the story of the cube's history, including its appearance in popular culture, such as in 'The Simpsons' and 'The Big Bang Theory'. It also includes simple algorithms to solve the cube, as well as tricks to speed up the process. Even celebrities like Justin Bieber and Will Smith have attempted to solve the cube, with times of 90 seconds and under 60 seconds, respectively. On the other hand, David Hasselhoff has admitted to never being able to solve it. As Rubik himself writes in the book's prologue, the cube has been 'practically everywhere', from remote villages to elegant offices.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 08:23 AM\nSource:[xeu.mx](https://xeu.mx/tecnociencia/1359252/los-50-anos-del-cubo-de-rubik-obra-de-diseno-convertida-en-juguete-matematico-e-icono-pop)\n\n**The Cultural Phenomenon of Rubik's Cube: From Teaching Tool to Speedcubing Record**\nErn\u00f6 Rubik's 3D puzzle, the Rubik's Cube, was invented as a teaching tool for his students and patented on January 30, 1975. It became a popular toy. Speedcubers have taken it to the next level, solving the cube in record time, often under 4 seconds, using the 'Fridrich-Methode' which allows them to sort multiple layers at once.

The current world record holder, Max Park from the US, can solve the cube in just 3.13 seconds. In contrast, the cube's inventor, Ern\u0151 Rubik, took around a month to solve it. With over 412,000 participants in speedcubing competitions worldwide, the activity has gained popularity, with global sales of Rubik's Cube products reaching $86.6 million in 2023, a 13.5% increase from 2022. Researchers now praise speedcubing not only as a popular hobby but also as an activity that can have benefits for well-being. According to Polina Beloborodova, associate researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 'Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness.' Beloborodova explains that speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competition, a sense of efficacy, and mastery. Julia Christensen, researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, adds that solving the cube can also evoke happiness by triggering aesthetic emotions such as wonder, beauty, and being moved. 'When a pattern is correct, when a movement is particularly astonishing, these aesthetic emotions can provide transformative experiences,' Christensen says.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 01:52 AM\nSource:[noticias24hrs.com.ve](https://www.noticias24hrs.com.ve/speedcubing-el-antiguo-hobby-que-segun-cientificos-puede-hacerte-mas-feliz/)\n\n**Ningbo Student Breaks Chinese Record for Solving Rubik's Cube**\n12-year-old Chen Zhen from Ningbo, China broke the Chinese record for solving a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube with a single hand, achieving an average time of 8.42 seconds at the 2025 WCA West Anshan New Year's Cube Competition.

Leng Yi Chen surpassed the previous record holder Ye Jiahui's time of 2.352 seconds by 1.111 seconds. In the live challenge, Leng Yi Chen only needed four attempts and took around ten minutes to complete. He said, 'I'm satisfied with my performance, although I didn't break the record again.' Leng Yi Chen started practicing speedcubing at the age of 9 and initially focused on 2x2 and 3x3 cubes. However, he later shifted his attention to speedcubing and developed new solving methods, which significantly improved his speed. He has also been promoting speedcubing culture and encouraging others to join the sport.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 12:14 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250111/47857476.html)\n\n**Poligny Speed Cubing: The First International Rubik's Cube Competition in the Jura Region**\nThe Poligny speed cubing club is organizing the first international Rubik's cube competition in the Jura region on January 18 and 19. The event will bring together 86 competitors from different countries, with the youngest being 9 years old and the oldest 56. The competition will feature various disciplines, including speed cubing with eyes closed. The president of the club, Jean-Baptiste Brelot, explains that the speed cubing is a mental challenge that requires strategy and quick thinking. He notes that the average age of competitors is around 20 years old, with many being students in engineering school. The competition will be a test of speed and skill, with the goal of solving the Rubik's cube in the shortest time possible. The current world record for solving a 3x3 cube is held by Max Park, who solved it in 3.134 seconds in June 2023.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 08:03 AM\nSource:[actu.fr](https://actu.fr/bourgogne-franche-comte/poligny_39434/poligny-speed-cubing-deux-jours-pour-un-tournoi-international-de-rubiks-cube_62089067.html)\n\n**Chengdu Student Breaks Guinness World Record for Fastest Time to Solve Gear Cube**\nCold Yichen, a 10th-grade student from Chengdu Foreign Language School, broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest time to solve a Gear Cube with a time of 1.241 seconds. This record was previously held by Ye Jiahui with a time of 2.352 seconds. Cold Yichen attempted to break the record four times, initially achieving a time of 1.718 seconds, but continued to challenge himself to achieve an even faster time. He eventually succeeded in breaking the record with a time of 1.241 seconds. Cold Yichen has been interested in Rubik's Cubes since he was in the 4th grade and has not only innovated new solving methods but also promoted the culture of Rubik's Cubes, teaching his club members and many young children how to solve Gear Cubes. 'Breaking the world record is just the beginning, I will continue to develop new methods for solving irregular-shaped Rubik's Cubes,' Cold Yichen said, 'I will continue to research and make more people understand and master the methods of solving irregular-shaped Rubik's Cubes.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 12:51 AM\nSource:[\u5317\u9752\u7f51](http://news.ynet.com/2025/01/11/3855414t70.html)\n\n**Rubik's Cube Championship: A Retro-Hobby That Brings Joy**\n500 participants from around the world, including some from as far as Mongolia and Canada, gathered in the UK for the British Speedcubing Championship.
