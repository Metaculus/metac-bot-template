Despite high internal inflation, the weakness of growth and expected inflation for this year favor a more neutral reference rate. From a risk management perspective, a 2.75% rate allows for a slower reduction in rates in response to inflation shocks, while rate cuts provide additional protection against downward risks. The ECB has shifted its focus from a sufficiently restrictive policy to an appropriate one, leading to increased discussion within the Governing Council about an adequate configuration of the neutral rate. Given the uncertainty about the neutral rate range and high internal inflation, which reflects persistent price pressures in the services sector, PIMCO expects interest rates to continue to fall gradually. Markets expect a terminal rate of around 2%, which is in line with PIMCO's estimates of a neutral rate for the euro area. However, PIMCO sees further risks of downward growth for the euro area after the US elections and the possibility of lower terminal rates than currently expected. The macroeconomic risk balance has shifted from concerns about high inflation to those about low growth: the ECB's constant 0.3% quarterly growth rate (q/q) forecast for all quarters of 2025 seems increasingly the maximum limit.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 03:05 PM\nSource:[investmentworld.it](https://www.investmentworld.eu/it/pimco-la-bce-si-posiziona-verso-la-neutralita/)\n\n**Expectations for 2025: US Economy to Continue Growing, Euro Zone to Face Challenges**\nWe expect the US economy to continue growing in 2025, with a healthy increase in its real GDP thanks to the strength of investment, although consumption may slow down - the International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast to 2.7%. The increase in tariffs on imports from other countries and restrictions on immigration can be offset by favorable financial conditions, tax cuts, and rapid deregulation. However, the introduction of 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports may be inflationary, with a risk of retaliatory trade measures. Additionally, expelling immigrants may generate additional inflation. Therefore, the greatest risk is an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, to which the market gives 30% probability. Currently, housing rental data suggests that housing inflation may slow down, and we expect the Federal Reserve to leave its interest rate unchanged at 4.375% and its president Powell to suggest that it may be patient before cutting it again. In the Euro Zone, the sentiment is depressed, with high geopolitical uncertainty, non-valuable valuations in absolute terms, and potential lower earnings growth compared to other regions. We expect general and underlying inflation to converge towards the ECB's target, with a probable new interest rate cut of 0.25% in January and even a decrease to 1.75% this year. Therefore, GDP growth may rebound slightly in 2025 - S&P Global's preliminary estimate of the composite index of purchasing managers for the Euro Zone has risen to 50.2 in January, above the threshold that separates growth from contraction. However, commercial uncertainty may weigh on exports and consumer and business confidence, with the EU's response being key. Nevertheless, Spain may outperform other major Euro Zone economies, and Southern Europe may be more resilient to external shocks than Northern Europe. Regarding China, there is uncertainty about the scope and impact of US tariffs. Additional measures and a weaker renminbi may partially offset the negative effect, although an additional 60% tariff may make costs too high. Currently, Trump 2.0 has had a softer tone than expected, although the increase in tariffs may be delayed rather than canceled. Meanwhile, China's PMI manufacturing index has been at 49.1 in January. Its government may set a growth target of 4.5% to 5% for 2025, requiring more policy efforts in fiscal, real estate, and monetary policy, consumption, and public investment, and less burden on the housing sector. However, if its authorities aggressively relax monetary policy, fears of 'Japanese-style' bond market may intensify. In any case, Trump's trade policies may cause large fluctuations in valuations. We expect the US equity market to perform better than other regions in 2025. Currently, strong interannual growth in earnings in the US is expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. Despite Trump's conflicting statements and executive orders, his industrial and financial sectors have performed well. The case is that in 2024, the expansion of valuation multiples has been concentrated in a few stocks, and the risk premium -equity return minus bond return at 10-year maturity- has been negative. It may need to normalize through a decline in stock prices, an increase in earnings, or a decrease in bond yields. However, this concentration will decrease, facilitated by deregulation and an increase in mergers and acquisitions after years of low activity -one of our topics for 2025-. Monte dei Paschi has launched a takeover bid for Mediobanca, the French group Bureau Veritas and the Swiss SGS are debating a possible merger, Commerzbank intends to acquire Unicredit, and Honda and Nissan are in merger talks in Japan. So, we like certain companies that may be subject to mergers and acquisitions in all sectors. However, we must be selective. Hence, the importance of active management to select companies and sectors. We prefer companies with abundant free cash flow. We also take into account that deregulation and valuations in public markets may reactivate private capital investments. Additionally, we maintain optionality regarding European stocks, given that unexpected results, even positive surprises, may occur. This is the case if a peace in Ukraine materializes. Also, if greater political stability in the Euro Zone is generated, with a possible catalyst being the German elections in February 2025. Germany struggles to grow, and the head of the German central bank has already urged Berlin to ease debt restrictions to increase investment. In fixed income, we prefer high-quality corporate debt in Europe. Although yield differentials are historically adjusted, we do not expect a recession, and this debt should remain stable. However, in the US, the yield differential between sovereign debt at 10-year maturity and short-term maturities is limited, and we are neutral on US Treasury bonds, although with the option that the Trump administration may be less inflationary and more fiscally prudent than expected. Currently, Trump's contradictory messages on tariffs and trade policy have caused the dollar to weaken against other currencies. In normal conditions, the dollar may reach 1.04 EUR, with parity at some point. A negative surprise may occur if US fiscal discipline is reduced or a global trade war breaks out. In such a scenario, both gold -which does not generate income but diversifies- and the Swiss franc may serve as a 'safe haven'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 11:10 AM\nSource:[Cinco D\u00edas](https://cincodias.elpais.com/mercados-financieros/caracter-independiente/2025-01-29/momento-secuencia-y-magnitud-de-los-cambios-configuran-2025.html)\n\n**EUR/GBP falls below 0.8400 as continuing losing streak due to a potential ECB rate cut**\nThe EUR/GBP currency pair has fallen below 0.8400 due to a potential European Central Bank (ECB) rate cut.

Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that economic growth is his top priority, highlighting signs that the economy is starting to recover. However, the Pound Sterling (GBP) remains under pressure amid rising concerns over the risk of stagflation in the UK economy, driven by weakening labor demand and persistent inflation.

This would be the lowest level since February 2023. However, despite the expected rate cut, the ECB's management may face uncertainty due to the increasing US tariffs. Goldman Sachs economist Sven Jari Stehn expects the ECB to cut rates further in 2025, with a potential target of 1.5%. Francesco Pesole from ING believes that the ECB's message will repeat and trigger a wave of low-interest rates in the Eurozone. Bank of America predicts that the ECB will lower interest rates in both January and March, and eventually reach the potential target of 1.5%. However, Ruben Segura-Cayuela from Bank of America warns that the new rate cut may be delayed until after March due to the volatility in core inflation. The ECB's delegation in Davos acknowledged that inflation risks are differentiating between the US and the Eurozone, and that European inflation concerns are less severe. They also did not mention the upward inflation risk from energy prices.

The ECB aims to achieve an inflation rate of 2% and is close to this goal, with a current inflation rate of 2.2% in Germany. ECB President Christine Lagarde has hinted at another rate cut in January 2025. As a result, European banks are adjusting their daily and term deposit rates downwards. Instead of letting money sit idle, consider investing in a fixed-term deposit with WeltSparen, which offers rates up to 3.4% p.a. and a 150 Euro bonus for new customers who sign up with the code BONUS150.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/deals/shopping-deal-mit-focus-online-bis-zu-3-4-prozent-sparzinsen-p-a-jetzt-geld-anlegen-und-150-euro-bonus-sichern_id_260143773.html)\n\n**La Fed en pause, la BCE devrait maintenir son cycle de baisse des taux en janvier**\nMichael Krautzberger, Global CIO Fixed Income at AllianzGI, believes that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will maintain its cautious stance and keep interest rates unchanged in the short term, while evaluating future growth and inflation data. In contrast, the European Central Bank (BCE) is expected to continue its interest rate reduction cycle in January, given the region's expected 1% growth in 2025, down from 0.7% in 2024. The core eurozone economies are facing both cyclical and structural headwinds, as well as uncertainty over future trade and tariffs, which could lead to lower growth in the region. However, the general scenario of disinflation remains intact, with the global and core eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rates standing at 2.4% and 2.7% respectively. In the short term, the region's structural challenges, commercial uncertainty, and political paralysis, ahead of the German federal election at the end of February, paint a negative picture of European prospects in 2025. Nevertheless, the region's financial conditions are easing, aided by expectations of a rapid withdrawal of the BCE's restrictive policy and a weak euro. A potential reform of Germany's debt brake after the German election could also contribute to reducing the risks facing the region. From a strategic perspective, we prefer shortening the yield curve in the US and Germany, as we believe that term premia are still too low on these two markets. We also prefer exposure to duration in countries that offer a better risk-return ratio, in markets that currently evaluate a shorter interest rate reduction cycle, and where real yields seem relatively attractive. In this context, we prefer a tactical short position on US duration. We also prefer to hold protection against US inflation, given the orientation of US monetary and fiscal policy and the potential risks of higher inflation resulting from US trade and immigration policies.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/actualites/la-fed-en-pause-la-bce-devrait-maintenir-son-cycle-de-baisse-des-taux-en-janvier-5176de42ae554611f2a9f43ddc511438)\n\n**Eurozone Economic Forecasts: A Mixed Picture**\nA recent survey by Dow Jones Newswires among European banks forecasts economic growth and inflation rates for the Eurozone.

Various banks have provided their own forecasts, with ABN Amro predicting 1.2% growth in 2025 and 2.0% inflation, while Barclays forecasts 0.8% growth in 2025 and 2.1% inflation.

After a 2024 marked by the fight against inflation and a restrictive monetary policy, recent statements by Christine Lagarde have made it clear that the cycle of interest rate cuts will continue. The upcoming meeting on January 30 could be just the beginning of a series of reductions aimed at returning the economy to a more balanced level. Lagarde stated, 'We have made significant progress in 2024 to reduce inflation and expect 2025 to be the year when we are within the target.' The BCE is facing a critical juncture, with the recent inflation spike in December, which closed at 2.4%, and underlying inflation at 2.7%, potentially raising doubts about an imminent interest rate cut. However, Lagarde's recent words have left little doubt about the institution's path in the coming months. A general consensus among analysts is that the BCE will reduce interest rates by 25 basis points on January 30. Oxford Economics believes that the December inflation increase will not hinder the decision, given that inflation expectations are once again anchored and wage growth has moderated. ING experts note that there is a 'growing consensus on the need for new interest rate cuts' and that the decision to continue this trend is 'practically an obviousness.' The BCE is in a situation where, according to several economists, the current interest rate is still too restrictive for an economy that still shows signs of weakness. Despite some arguing that monetary policy cannot solve structural problems, the economic and political uncertainty in the eurozone forces the BCE to act quickly. The market is already anticipating a continued cycle of cuts throughout the year. According to Danske Bank analysts, the BCE's strategy seems clear: another 25 basis point cut that would bring the official rate to 2.75%. If this pace is maintained, the interest rate could reach a 'neutral' level by mid-2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[euribor.com.es](https://www.euribor.com.es/2025/01/27/hasta-donde-bajaran-los-tipos-en-2025-la-hoja-de-ruta-del-bce-al-descubierto/)\n\n**Inflation set to remain above 2% in the coming months**\nAccording to the Ifo-Institute, many companies plan to raise prices, which will have consequences for consumers at the checkout. The inflation rate is expected to remain above 2% in the coming months, with the Ifo-Konjunkturchef Timo Wollmersh\u00e4user predicting a rate of 2.5%. The European Central Bank (EZB) aims for a medium-term inflation rate of 2.0% in the euro area. While a strong inflation wave like the one after the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war in February 2022 is not expected, a trade conflict with the US could lead to higher prices. In December, prices for services and food led to the second-highest inflation rate in Germany last year, with a 2.6% increase in consumer prices compared to the previous year. The inflation rate was only higher in January 2024, with 2.9%. The higher inflation rate reduces the purchasing power of consumers, who can afford less for a euro. The financial leeway of people is shrinking, and income increases are being eroded by inflation.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 16, 2025 11:57 AM\nSource:[n-tv.de](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Inflation-setzt-sich-bei-ueber-zwei-Prozent-fest-article25493090.html)\n\n**EU Eurozone Inflation Rate Reaches 2.4% in December 2024**\nThe European Union's (EU) inflation rate in the eurozone reached 2.4% in December 2024, surpassing the 2.2% in November and meeting economists' average predictions. This is also the highest level since July 2024. The inflation rate has continued to rise for three consecutive months since September 2024. Energy costs, which had previously contributed to a decline in inflation, now have a minor positive impact of 0.1%. The core inflation rate, which excludes volatile products such as energy, food, and tobacco, remained at 2.7% in December 2024, a level maintained since September 2024. This indicator is closely watched by the European Central Bank (ECB), which aims to keep prices growing at a moderate 2% rate in the medium term. The ECB will review its monetary policy in late January and release new data, with the next decision on eurozone interest rates expected on January 30.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 09:31 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=60729199-f7c7-49d9-ba14-b8b89a70ada1)\n\n**Eurozone Inflation Rises, ECB Expected to Cut Interest Rates**\nThe inflation rate in the Eurozone has risen for the third consecutive month, reaching 2.4% in December, according to Eurostat. However, the European Central Bank (Bce) is expected to maintain its policy of cutting interest rates, albeit with a slight adjustment. In Italy, prices increased by 0.1% in December and 1.3% in the past year, with a slowdown in the growth of food prices. The Italian inflation rate is expected to remain at 1% in 2024, a significant decrease from the 5.7% seen in 2023. The European Central Bank's decision to cut interest rates is seen as a response to the rising inflation, with markets expecting a new rate cut of 0.25% when the council meets on January 30. This move would consolidate the option of a 'gradual' rate cut, but would complicate the prospects of a more aggressive reduction of 0.5% in 2025, as advocated by some within the Eurosystem. As said by the ECB, 'the increase in inflation seems to consolidate the option already on the table, that is a new mini-cut 'gradual' of the rates equal to 0.25%.' \nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 04:15 AM\nSource:[ilmessaggero.it](https://www.ilmessaggero.it/economia/news/l_inflazione_sale_ma_la_bce_tagliera_tassi_italia_2024_prezzi_rialzo_1-8579451.html)\n\n**Eurozone's inflation rises to 2.4% in December: Eurostat**\nThe eurozone's annual inflation rate for December 2024 stood at 2.4 percent, up from 2.2 percent in November, according to Eurostat. The price of services is driving inflation, with a 4 percent annual rate, followed by food, alcohol, and tobacco at 2.7 percent. Peter Vanden Houte, chief economist at ING for the eurozone, warned that energy prices will be a significant upward risk to inflation in the first quarter of 2025, and also predicted a rise in agricultural commodity prices and the risk of a trade war. Services inflation remains a concern due to strong wage increases and higher price-setting by services companies. Vanden Houte expressed skepticism about the European Central Bank's forecast of declining inflation and predicted a further increase in the eurozone's inflation during the first quarter of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 10:29 PM\nSource:[dailyfinland.fi](https://www.dailyfinland.fi/europe/41229/Eurozones-inflation-rises-to-2.4-in-December-Eurostat)\n\n**Eurozone inflation controlled, but external risks and structural tensions persist**\nThe European Union's inflation rate has been controlled at 2.4% in December, just above the European Central Bank's (BCE) target of 2%. Although this level is far from the historic highs of 2023, analysts warn that economic challenges have not disappeared. Throughout 2024, inflation has shown a moderate behavior, with a low point of 1.7% in September, but ending the year with an expected increase in the consumer price index (IPC). The BCE has played a key role in this process, reducing interest rates from 4% to 3% to stimulate economic growth while keeping prices under control. However, the recent inflation surge could complicate future decisions for the BCE. External risks and structural tensions continue to threaten the economic stability of the eurozone. The BCE's next meeting on January 30 will be crucial in determining whether this period of relief will be consolidated or if new factors will trigger another inflationary storm. As ING economists point out, the inflationary rebound and the persistence of underlying inflation, which excludes volatile components such as energy and fresh food, could lead the BCE to maintain a conservative stance. 'The repunte inflacionario and the persistence of inflation subyacente could lead the BCE to maintain a conservative stance,' said ING economists.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 05:39 PM\nSource:[mundiario.com](https://www.mundiario.com/articulo/economia/eurozona-cierra-2024-inflacion-controlada-amenazas-vista/20250107183907329771.html)\n\n**Eurozone Inflation Rises, Strengthening Hopes for ECB Rate Cuts**\nThe inflation rate in the Eurozone rose to 2.4% in December 2024, driven by 'base effects' such as lower energy costs compared to the previous year.

According to Ulrike Kastens, senior economist at the firm, the data published by Eurostat 'coincides with the ECB's forecasts for the fourth quarter of 2024'. However, she notes that German data also shows that 'we should not underestimate the underlying inflation risks'. Despite this, she expects the ECB to continue cutting interest rates, citing the 'weakness of the economy' and 'difficulty for companies to pass on price increases due to weak demand'. Kastens predicts that inflation will be around the ECB's 2% target for 2025. 'We still expect a new 25 basis point cut in the deposit rate in January', she says. Despite strong price pressures in Germany in December, the Eurozone's inflation rate only rose to 2.4% from 2.2% in November. Service prices rose 4%, leaving the core rate unchanged at 2.7%. Energy prices also rose for the first time since July 2024, up 0.1% year-over-year. Consumers also had to spend 2.7% more on food than the previous year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:42 PM\nSource:[Bolsamania](https://www.bolsamania.com/fundsnews/noticias/value-investing/ipc-zona-euro-vuelve-subir-bce-sigue-camino-recortar-tipos--18469878.html)\n\n**Eurozone Inflation Expectations Rise to 2.6%: ECB Survey**\nAccording to the European Central Bank's (ECB) Consumer Expectations Survey, consumer inflation expectations in the Eurozone have risen to their highest level in two months. The survey found that consumers' average inflation expectations for the next 12 months rose to 2.6% from 2.5%. This is the highest level since July, when expectations rose to 2.4%. The ECB's inflation target is 2%, and both expectations are above this target. The ECB's Consumer Expectations Survey also found that consumers' expectations for economic growth decreased by 0.2 points to -1.3%. ECB officials had previously considered these levels to be 'close' to the 2% target. The ECB's next interest rate meeting is on January 30, and some officials have signaled that they may consider further interest rate cuts in 2025 due to low inflation risks and a weak economy.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[birgun.net](https://www.birgun.net/haber/euro-bolgesi-nde-enflasyon-beklentileri-artiyor-589160)\n\n**Eurozone Inflation Rises to 2.4% in December**\nThe eurozone's inflation rate increased to 2.4% in December, according to preliminary estimates from Eurostat. This is a 0.2 percentage point increase from November's 2.2%. The energy sector drove the increase, rising to 0.1% from -2% in November. The services sector also saw an increase, reaching 4% from 3.9% in November. Food prices remained stable at 2.7%. If confirmed, this would be the eurozone's third consecutive inflation increase. Eurostat expects Germany and Spain to see increases in inflation, reaching 2.8% each, while Italy is expected to see a decrease. The European Central Bank aims to return to its inflation target of 2% by 2025. The bank's governing council will meet on January 30 to discuss monetary policy, including the possibility of further interest rate cuts.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 11:02 AM\nSource:[eunews.it](https://www.eunews.it/2025/01/07/eurozona-2024-inflazione-24-dicembre/)\n\n**Euro area annual inflation up to 2.4%**\nThe euro area annual inflation rate has increased to 2.4%. The inflation rate is calculated as the change in the price level of consumer goods and services between the current month and the same month of the previous year. The next release of full data for December 2024 is scheduled for 17 January 2025. The euro area consists of 19 countries, including Belgium, Germany, and France, and the inflation data refer to the country composition at a specific point in time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 10:55 AM\nSource:[European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-07012025-ap)\n\n**MNI BRIEF: Euro Area Consumer Inflation Expectations Edge Up**\nEuro area consumer inflation expectations rose for the second consecutive month in November to 2.6%, according to the ECB's consumer expectations survey. The inflation outlook over the next three years also increased to 2.4%, a level last recorded in July 2024. However, expectations at the one-year and three-year horizons remain below the perceived past inflation rate. The current perceived inflation rate over the previous 12 months increased to 3.4%, compared to the actual 2.2% reported by Eurostat. Uncertainty about inflation expectations remained unchanged at its lowest level since February 2022. The ECB previously stated that inflation would edge higher into year-end 2024, but drop sustainably to the 2% target in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[marketnews.com](https://marketnews.com/mni-brief-euro-area-consumer-inflation-expectations-edge-up-1736240400382)\n\n**Pensions 2025: What's new in January, increases and conguagli are on the way?**\nThere are no significant changes to the pension system in 2025. However, there will be an increase in pensions due to the usual annual inflation adjustment, which will be 0.8% for the first rate of 2025. This means that pensioners who are below 4 times the minimum INPS treatment will see their pensions increase by 0.8%. For example, a pensioner who currently receives 938 euros per month will receive 945 euros per month in January 2025. On the other hand, pensioners who exceed 4 times the minimum INPS treatment will see a reduction in the inflation adjustment, which will be 0.72% for the portion of the pension between 4 and 5 times the minimum INPS, and 0.6% for the portion above. There will be no conguagli (adjustments) on the pension of January 2025, as the inflation rate for 2024 was confirmed as definitive and there will be no difference between the provisional and definitive inflation rates.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 16, 2024 08:14 AM\nSource:[investireoggi.it](https://www.investireoggi.it/pensioni-2025-cosa-ci-sara-in-piu-a-gennaio-aumenti-e-conguagli-sono-in-arrivo/)\n\n",

However, recent historical data shows that inflation has been volatile, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic and the geopolitical tensions impacting supply chains. Over the past few years, the inflation rate has frequently exceeded 2.4% due to these conditions, with significant instances recorded. Given these recent patterns, a base rate of 50% is set for the probability that the inflation rate will be above 2.4% in January 2025.",
