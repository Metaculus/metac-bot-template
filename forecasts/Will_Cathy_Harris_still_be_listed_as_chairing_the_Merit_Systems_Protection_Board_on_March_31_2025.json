The move was in response to a request from OSC head Hampton Dellinger, who argued that the firings were probably illegal and recommended that they be halted pending an investigation. The MSPB said that the request for a 45-day stay of the terminations was appropriate 'while OSC further investigates their complaints.' Democracy Forward president and CEO Skye Perryman called the decision 'the correct result of a clearly unlawful and massively disruptive action by the Trump administration.' The decision could have wider implications for the thousands of probationary employees fired in recent weeks, and OSC is considering ways to seek relief for a broader group.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/26/probationary-employee-firings-trump-musk-doge/)\n\n**Q4 2024 Merit Medical Systems Inc Earnings Call Transcript**\nMerit Medical Systems' fourth-quarter 2024 earnings conference call was held on February 25, 2025.

The decision, made at the request of Hampton Dellinger, the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, will stay the employees' terminations for 45 days. Dellinger argued that the agencies that employed the employees acted unlawfully by firing them, and that they misused the employees' probationary status to carry out de facto reductions-in-force. Ray Limon, the board's other Democratic member, agreed, saying that there were 'reasonable grounds to believe that each of the six agencies engaged in a prohibited personnel practice.' Dellinger welcomed the ruling, saying that his office 'will continue to pursue allegations of unlawful personnel actions, which can include asking MSPB for relief for a broader group of fired probationary employees.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 05:01 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-agency-halts-trump-administrations-045622976.html)\n\n**Merit Medical Systems, Inc.

A National Institutes of Health employee, who was let go on Valentine's Day, is among those challenging their layoff. She said, 'They terminated me, saying that I was not meeting the requirements of my probationary period. I have my supervisor's review from the previous November stating that I was exceeding expectations, so my review and the termination letter do not match at all.' The employee's case is pending, and she has not seen any progress since filing her appeal on Feb. 19. The board's case load has skyrocketed since the wave of U.S. government layoffs began, with an average of 100 new cases per week before jumping to 578 cases in one week and 1,845 cases in another. The worker said one reason she's challenging her dismissal is due to the letter stating her job performance was to blame for her being fired. She added, 'I want my job back. I loved my job. I was proud of my job, and I didn't deserve to have it taken away.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 02:12 AM\nSource:[WTOP](https://wtop.com/government/2025/02/amid-federal-layoffs-u-s-merit-systems-protection-board-sees-dramatic-spike-in-appeals-from-feds/)\n\n**Amid federal layoffs, US Merit Systems Protection Board sees dramatic spike in appeals from feds**\nSince the US government layoffs began, the US Merit Systems Protection Board has seen a dramatic spike in appeals from federal workers. Over the past two weeks, more than 2,000 cases have been received. A former NIH employee who was let go on Valentine's Day is among those challenging their layoff, citing a discrepancy between her supervisor's review and the termination letter. The employee, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she was rated 'Achieved More than Expected Results' or 'Achieved Outstanding Results' in every category, but was still terminated. She believes the termination letter is 'boiler plate text' and is challenging her dismissal. The worker is not alone, as many others are facing similar situations, with some even considering a class-action lawsuit against the federal government. The situation has left many in a tough spot, with bills continuing to come in despite the lack of paychecks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[wtop.com](https://wtop.com/government/2025/02/amid-federal-layoffs-u-s-merit-systems-protection-board-sees-dramatic-spike-in-appeals-from-feds/)\n\n**Agency Head Court Shielded From Removal Is Publicly Pushing Against Trump Admin's Efforts**\nHampton Dellinger, head of the Office of Special Counsel, has publicly opposed the Trump administration's terminations of federal employees, stating that firing probationary employees without individual cause 'appears contrary to a reasonable reading of the law.' Dellinger, who was reinstated by a federal judge after being fired by President Trump, has filed requests to pause terminations for six probationary employees and is looking for ways to help others in the same position. The Supreme Court has allowed a temporary restraining order reinstating Dellinger to remain in place until February 26, when it is set to expire. Dellinger's organization, Democracy Forward, is also representing federal employees facing termination and will continue to urge the Office of Special Counsel and the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board to follow the law and protect federal workers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2025/02/25/hampton-dellinger-court-shielded-removal-publicly-pushing-against-trump-admins-efforts/)\n\n**Elon Musk's Deadline for Federal Employees to Explain Their Achievements Passes**\nDellinger asked the US Merit Systems Protection Board to stop the layoffs of six federal employees, but hinted that many more workers should be protected from losing their jobs.

The judge's order temporarily restored Harris to her position and prohibited government officials from treating her as having been removed. Harris's counsel argued that she could only be terminated for 'inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office' and that she was not given a reason for her termination. The government attorneys argue that President Trump had the ability to fire MSPB members at will and that Harris's attorneys fell short of making a strong enough showing that she would succeed on merits in her position. They claim that the president is being prevented from installing an agency head of his choosing and that this harm is irreparable to the Executive Branch and the separation of powers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 11:11 PM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-administration-appeals-against-order-to-reinstate-merit-systems-board-chair-5813526)\n\n**Judge halts Trump's effort to fire Democrat from government workplace board**\nA federal judge has temporarily reinstated Cathy Harris, a Democrat who was fired by President Trump as the chair of the Merit Systems Protection Board.

Historically, such positions are stable unless major political or legal reasons provoke changes. Given that she was reinstated by a federal judge, this suggests legal backing for her role continuity, but such reinstatements can sometimes be contested or lead to repositioning depending on political pressures.
