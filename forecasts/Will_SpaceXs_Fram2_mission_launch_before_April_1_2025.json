SpaceX is planning to conduct another test flight of its massive Starship vehicle in early January, with the goal of reusing the booster and releasing some Starlink satellites. The reusability and high cargo capacity of the Starship represent the main strengths for drastically reducing launch costs. After this test, SpaceX plans an even more ambitious flight, aimed at demonstrating the ability to transfer propellant between two Starship vehicles in Earth orbit, a crucial step for testing the ability to use this spacecraft in future missions to the Moon and Mars. Blue Origin, on the other hand, will launch its orbital rocket New Glenn in January, which will become the primary launch vehicle for the over 3,000 satellites of the Kuiper internet constellation of Amazon. The entry of Blue Origin into the heavy launcher market will consolidate the role of Jeff Bezos' company as a direct competitor to SpaceX. The European Space Agency (ESA) will also be a protagonist in 2025 with the launch of the Space Rider, scheduled for the third quarter. This spacecraft will spend two months in Earth orbit, during which it will automatically conduct technological demonstrations and experiments in microgravity conditions. At the end of the mission, the Space Rider will return to Earth, landing on a runway at the European spaceport in French Guiana. Designed by the ESA, the spacecraft can be reused for at least five flights and represents an important step towards continuous and cost-effective access to Earth orbit. Human space exploration will continue to play a central role in 2025, with SpaceX launching a new commercial mission with the Crew Dragon capsule. The mission, known as FRAM2, will take four private explorers to a polar orbit, a trajectory never before traversed by crewed vehicles. The mission will be led by polar explorer Chun Wang and will include filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, polar explorer Eric Philips, and engineer/scientist Rabea Rogge. Axiom Space will continue its commercial missions to the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming months, with Axiom-4, the fourth crewed mission, using the Crew Dragon to take four astronauts to the ISS, where they will spend a decade conducting various scientific experiments. This mission represents another step towards the realization of the AxStation, a private space station initially connected to the ISS but destined to operate autonomously. The space station could host both private and institutional activities and represent the future of orbital exploration after 2030, when the ISS will be decommissioned. 2025 will also be a year of direct ventures beyond Earth's orbit, with Firefly Aerospace launching the Ghost Riders in the Sky mission in January, designed to land an automatic vehicle that carries a decade of NASA experiments on the Moon. The landing is expected in a region formed by ancient volcanic eruptions dating back over three billion years. The Blue Ghost 1 lander will operate for an entire lunar day (about 14 Earth days), collecting data on the lunar surface and the interaction with the solar wind, the flow of charged particles emitted by the Sun. In February, it will be the turn of the automatic Intuitive Machines-2 (IM-2) mission, which will continue the work of the previous IM-1. Despite the rollover that occurred at the time of landing, IM-1 represented the first lunar landing of a spacecraft built by a private company. IM-2 will also land at the South Pole, carrying a drill and a mass spectrometer to examine the composition of the lunar subsurface. The mission also includes the release of the small Lunar Trailblazer satellite, designed to remain in orbit and map the deposits of water ice present at the South Pole lunar. These data will be fundamental for NASA in planning future Artemis missions, which will return astronauts to the Moon over half a century after the successes of the Apollo program.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[HuffPost Italia](https://www.huffingtonpost.it/blog/2025/01/06/news/dal_web_alle_stelle_musk_vs_bezos_sfida_spaziale_del_2025-18121224/)\n\n**German Astronaut Rabea Rogge Trains for Historic Space Mission**\nGerman researcher Rabea Rogge is preparing for her spaceflight as part of the 'Fram2' mission, which is scheduled for spring 2025.
