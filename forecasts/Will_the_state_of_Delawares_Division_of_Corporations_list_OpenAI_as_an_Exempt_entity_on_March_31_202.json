Altman said, 'Our structure ensures that no individual can take control of OpenAI. These are tactics to try to weaken us because we are making great progress.' The company's board may not be able to ignore the offer, as it involves two jurisdictions: California and Delaware. Altman has rejected Musk's offer, saying, 'The OpenAI mission is not for sale.' He also stated that the company's current structure prevents any individual from taking control. Musk has been trying to acquire OpenAI for a long time, and Altman sees this as just another attempt. The company is planning to restructure its operations, separating its commercial division from its non-profit board.

Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who left the board in 2018, has disagreed with the company's transition to commercial activity. He has taken OpenAI and Altman to court over the commercialization of the company, claiming it has been transformed into a de facto subsidiary of Microsoft with closed-source code. Musk stated, 'It's time for OpenAI to return to open-source code.' His AI startup X.AI, which was founded in March 2023, may merge with OpenAI after the deal. Musk has also gained the support of several investors, including Valor Equity Partners, Baron Capital, and others. In January, Musk's lawyer Mark Tobeyroff sent a letter to the California and Delaware attorneys general requesting an auction to sell his stake in OpenAI.

According to CNBC and Reuters, OpenAI will restructure its existing for-profit department into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in Delaware, while its non-profit department will hold a significant amount of equity in the for-profit department, providing ample resources for charitable activities in healthcare, education, and scientific research. OpenAI stated that the transformation into a hybrid non-profit/for-profit structure will help secure more funding and emphasized the need to 'raise significantly more money than we thought' and 'transition to a traditional equity-based model.' After restructuring, the company will also be exempt from some restrictions imposed on new companies and non-profit organizations. OpenAI aims to become a sustainable company by 2025, achieving its mission of developing 'artificial general intelligence' (AGI) that benefits humanity. However, OpenAI's plan to transform into a for-profit entity has been opposed by tech moguls like Elon Musk, who believes that OpenAI will struggle to balance its profit and social benefits, and Musk has even called it a 'scam' on his X platform.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 12:01 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=d2ec2bec-e357-4457-abe6-2a3aa31adf0f)\n\n**OpenAI Set to Transition to Public Benefit Corporation to Fuel AGI Mission**\nOpenAI is planning to transition into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) to enhance its mission of advancing artificial general intelligence (AGI) for the benefit of humanity.

According to OpenAI, this move will enable the company to raise capital with conventional terms, similar to other companies in the space.

In a recent blog post, the company explained that this change is necessary to maintain its primary mission of 'ensuring that General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) benefits all humanity.' This transition represents a significant shift from the company's non-profit origins in 2015. The decision was motivated primarily by the increasing costs of managing AI, with servers equipped with Nvidia Blackwell chips costing over $3 million. Despite controversy, this move appears inevitable to remain competitive in the sector. OpenAI will transform into a Public Benefit Corporation of Delaware. Currently, OpenAI operates as a 'limited' for-profit company with two divisions: the for-profit and non-profit. The non-profit division and its board of directors govern all of OpenAI's activities. The for-profit division can issue shares to raise capital, but remains under the control of the non-profit. To attract more investments, OpenAI is now switching to a completely for-profit model. Investors see the current profit limit (100 times the initial investment) as an obstacle. All residual value created beyond this threshold is returned to the non-profit division. Financial projections indicate that OpenAI may suffer a loss of $5 billion this year, against revenues of $3.7 billion. These numbers have likely influenced the decision to become a for-profit company to secure the necessary funding to maintain a competitive advantage. OpenAI plans to transform its current for-profit subsidiary into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) of Delaware, a business entity created for public and social benefit. The company has stated that ordinary shares and OpenAI's mission will be the public benefit interests of this entity. The non-profit division will maintain its philanthropic goals in areas such as healthcare, education, and science. It will have a 'significant interest' in the PBC in the form of equally valued shares by independent consultants. OpenAI claims that this structure will make its non-profit division one of the best-funded in history.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 01:47 PM\nSource:[tomshw.it](https://www.tomshw.it/hardware/openai-cambia-business-moel-da-no-profit-a-for-profit-2024-12-28)\n\n**OpenAI Plans to Restructure Company into For-Profit and Non-Profit Entities**\nOpenAI has announced plans to restructure its company, separating into a for-profit and a non-profit entity.

According to a statement, OpenAI plans to convert its existing for-profit business into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in Delaware, which requires the company to balance the interests of shareholders, stakeholders, and the public. The non-profit department of OpenAI will continue to exist and become one of the 'most resource-rich non-profit organizations in history', and will hold shares in the restructured PBC. If the restructuring is completed, the PBC will be responsible for OpenAI's operations and business, while the non-profit department will hire a leadership team and employees to develop charitable projects in areas such as healthcare, education, and science.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 08:51 AM\nSource:[std.stheadline.com](https://std.stheadline.com/realtime/article/2043965/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E8%B2%A1%E7%B6%93-OpenAI%E8%A8%88%E5%8A%83%E9%87%8D%E7%B5%84%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8%E7%B5%90%E6%A7%8B-%E6%8E%A1%E5%85%AC%E7%9B%8A%E4%BC%81%E6%A5%AD%E6%A8%A1%E5%BC%8F-%E9%83%A8%E5%88%86%E8%AE%8A%E8%BA%AB%E7%87%9F%E5%88%A9%E6%A9%9F%E6%A7%8B)\n\n**Why OpenAI plans transition to public benefit corporation**\nOpenAI plans to transition its for-profit arm into a Delaware public benefit corporation (PBC) to raise capital and stay ahead in the AI race. A PBC is a for-profit entity that is legally required to pursue one or more public benefits, including social and environmental goals. OpenAI's new structure aims to make a more investor-friendly corporation while maintaining a mission of funding a related charity. Rivals such as Anthropic and xAI have also adopted the PBC structure. According to Ann Lipton, a corporate law professor at Tulane Law School, becoming a benefit corporation does not guarantee a company will put its stated mission above profit, as the law only requires the board to 'balance' its mission and profit-making interests. 'The only reason to choose benefit form over any other corporate form is the declaration to the public. It doesn't actually have any real enforcement power behind it,' Lipton said. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 05:57 AM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/openai-transition-public-benefit-corporation-9748474/)\n\n**OpenAI Reorganizes into Non-Profit and For-Profit Entities**\nOpenAI has announced a reorganization of the company, separating into two entities: a non-profit and a for-profit organization.

The company's board of directors has evaluated the current structure and decided to create a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which will allow OpenAI to balance shareholder interests with the interests of stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers, and the environment. The PBC will issue common stock and will have a public benefit that aligns with OpenAI's mission. The non-profit organization will be sustainable and will have a significant amount of resources, with the existing for-profit company's important equity appearing as PBC shares. The PBC will operate and control OpenAI's business, while the non-profit organization will hire a leadership team and employees to focus on charitable activities in areas such as healthcare, education, and science. OpenAI's mission is to ensure that AGI benefits humanity, and the company is seeking to develop a sustainable model to achieve this goal.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 12:25 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8ffQQjnmw6j)\n\n**OpenAI to Become a Public Benefit Corporation**\nOpenAI plans to transform its for-profit branch into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) to raise capital and stay competitive in the costly AI race against companies like Google. The new structure aims to make OpenAI a more attractive investment opportunity while maintaining its mission to fund a connected charity. Similar to competitors like Anthropic, OpenAI will balance social and environmental goals with shareholder value. A PBC is a type of corporation that is legally required to pursue one or more public benefit goals, including social and environmental objectives. OpenAI's current structure is described as 'a for-profit entity, controlled by a non-profit organization, with a profit cap for investors and employees.' In the new organization, the non-profit organization will hold shares in the for-profit entity, just like external investors, and the for-profit entity will fund the charity's mission. According to OpenAI, 'the PBC will direct and control the operations and activities of OpenAI, while the non-profit organization will hire a management team and staff to pursue charitable initiatives in areas such as healthcare, education, and science.' Unlike PBCs, non-profit organizations do not have shareholders and reinvest profits into their mission rather than distributing them to individuals. PBCs do not have special tax exemptions or incentives, whereas non-profit organizations are generally exempt from federal income tax if they meet certain conditions. According to Ann Lipton, professor of corporate law at Tulane Law School, becoming a PBC does not guarantee that the company will prioritize its declared mission over profit, as the law only requires the board to 'balance' its mission and financial interests. The Delaware law requires the company to report to shareholders on the progress made in achieving its objectives, which, in practice, determines to what extent a PBC adheres to its mission, explains Lipton. 'The only reason to choose this form of corporation over another is the public declaration. There is no real enforcement power behind it,' added Lipton. Some legal experts also argue that listed PBCs are more likely to be acquired, as bidders can argue that the company does not maximize its profits or that its public benefit goals are in conflict with the bidder's objectives.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 10:43 PM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/MICROSOFT-CORPORATION-4835/actualite/Pourquoi-OpenAI-prevoit-elle-de-devenir-une-societe-d-utilite-publique--48660500/)\n\n**OpenAI mulls plan for more conventional for-profit business**\nOpenAI, a decade-old research organization, is considering a change to its structure to create a more conventional for-profit business alongside a nonprofit arm.

OpenAI's existing for-profit arm is currently controlled by its nonprofit organization, but under the proposal, the nonprofit entity would continue to exist and hold a 'significant interest' in the for-profit arm.

The company is evaluating the possibility of transforming its for-profit division into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would require the company to balance the interests of shareholders with those of the company and stakeholders. According to OpenAI, this conversion would allow the company to raise capital with more favorable terms, in line with the practices adopted by other innovative companies. The new structure could also strengthen the non-profit component of the organization, enabling the hiring of specialized personnel for charitable projects in the fields of health, education, and science. As stated in the company's post, 'The PBC will allow us to pursue our mission of generating value for society while maintaining a balance between economic and public interest objectives.' The current structure of OpenAI has been criticized since 2019, when the company decided to establish a for-profit division alongside the original non-profit foundation. This decision was motivated by the need to raise significant capital to support the development of complex artificial intelligence models. However, many observers have accused OpenAI of betraying its original mission. Criticisms have intensified in 2024, when Elon Musk, co-founder of OpenAI, filed a lawsuit against the company and its CEO Sam Altman, alleging that the leadership of OpenAI had manipulated his involvement, exploiting his ethical concerns about the risks of artificial intelligence to transform the organization into a purely commercial entity. According to the lawsuit, OpenAI had 'abandoned philanthropic principles' to focus on high profits, attracting the ire not only of Musk but also of other critics in the sector, such as David Sacks, a prominent consultant to the Trump administration. The proposal for restructuring comes at a time when artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly central in multiple sectors, from blockchain to healthcare. According to VanEck, a wealth manager, by 2025, agents of artificial intelligence created with models like ChatGPT will have a more significant role in decentralized communities, with an estimated population of one million active agents.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 08:38 PM\nSource:[cryptonomist.ch](https://cryptonomist.ch/2024/12/27/openai-rivoluzione-governance-rami-profit-e-non/)\n\n**OpenAI Abandons Non-Profit Model, Becomes For-Profit Company**\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has announced that it will abandon its non-profit model and become a for-profit company starting in 2025.

CEO Sam Altman stated, 'We need to become more than a laboratory and a startup: we need to transform into a durable company.' The company will become a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which requires balancing the interests of shareholders, stakeholders, and the public interest in business decisions. This move has been criticized by Elon Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 and has expressed concerns about the company's shift towards a profit-driven model, which he believes may compromise the development of ethical and secure AI technologies.

This new model would allow the company to manage its commercial operations while maintaining a non-profit division focused on social impact areas such as health, education, and science. According to the OpenAI board, 'hundreds of billions of dollars that large companies are investing in AI development show what is really needed for OpenAI to continue pursuing its mission.' The company is in discussions with regulators in California and Delaware to adopt the Delaware PBC model. The non-profit division would have a 'significant participation' in the PBC, determined by independent financial consultants. OpenAI's current structure is complex, having started as a non-profit in 2015 and later adopting a 'profit limited' model in 2019. However, this structure does not allow the board to consider the interests of those who finance the company directly.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 03:51 PM\nSource:[itforum.com.br](https://itforum.com.br/noticias/openai-nova-estrutura-corporativa/)\n\n**OpenAI Considers Transformation into Public Benefit Corporation**\nAccording to reports, OpenAI is considering transforming into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), which would allow the company to pursue profits while also serving social welfare purposes. As part of this new structure, the non-profit department would hold shares in the profitable entity. This transformation plan suggests that OpenAI's board of directors is moving forward with a reorganization. Currently, OpenAI's profitable department is controlled by its non-profit organization. The company would become a PBC in Delaware, and the non-profit organization would continue to exist as 'one of the most resourceful non-profit organizations in history.' OpenAI's board stated that the company would hold 'significant equity' in the profitable entity in the form of shares valued independently by a financial advisor.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 03:30 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/estate/integration/2024-12-27/doc-ineaxqvm2263544.shtml)\n\n**OpenAI Considers Structural Changes to Become Public Benefit Corporation**\nOpenAI is considering a structural change to become a public benefit corporation (PBC) while maintaining a non-profit division. The board of directors is reviewing a plan to transform the business into a PBC, which can generate revenue while improving society, while keeping a non-profit division. According to the proposed plan, the non-profit division would hold shares in the for-profit entity. The company has been in talks with regulators in California and Delaware about the possible change. Elon Musk, co-founder and initial investor of OpenAI, has filed a lawsuit against the company in August, alleging that it violated an agreement to operate as a non-profit organization. The OpenAI board stated that the proposed plan would ensure the long-term success of the for-profit arm of the company, help the non-profit organization to raise funds and execute its mission more effectively, and allow the non-profit division to pursue beneficial initiatives in areas such as healthcare, education, and science more efficiently. 'This plan would allow us to pursue our mission more effectively while also generating revenue to support our work,' said the OpenAI board. 'We believe this structure will enable us to make a greater impact and create a more sustainable future for our organization.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 01:43 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/openai-planea-cambios-estructurales-para-convertirse-en-una-corporacion-de-beneficio-publico-93CH-2961587)\n\n",
