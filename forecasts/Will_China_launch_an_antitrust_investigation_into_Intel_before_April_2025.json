This is due to concerns about antitrust issues with a joint venture. TSMC's packaging factory in the US would eliminate the main bottleneck in its advanced manufacturing process and ensure that the most advanced AI chips are manufactured in the US, aligning with the comments of US Vice President JD Vance. Vance emphasized that the US government is committed to dominating AI chips, AI software technology, and AI rule-making in various areas. He also stated that the Trump administration will ensure that the most powerful AI systems are built in the US using US-designed and manufactured chips. Following Vance's comments, Intel's stock price surged, and rumors emerged that Intel may spin off its semiconductor manufacturing division and form a joint venture with TSMC to drive the development of the US chip manufacturing industry, leading to a 25% increase in Intel's stock price over the past five days. However, Jefferies believes that TSMC is more likely to set up a packaging factory in the US than to form a joint venture with Intel. 'It is more likely that TSMC will set up a packaging factory in the US, which would eliminate the main bottleneck in its advanced manufacturing process and ensure that the most advanced AI chips are manufactured in the US,' said Jefferies. 'This would align with the comments of US Vice President JD Vance, who emphasized that the US government is committed to dominating AI chips, AI software technology, and AI rule-making in various areas.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 01:59 PM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831\u96fb\u5b50\u5831](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/4951921)\n\n**Chinese Stocks Surge, Apple Plans AI Launch in China, Intel Rumored to Form Joint Venture with TSMC**\nThe Chinese stock market saw a surge in popular Chinese stocks, with Alibaba rising over 6%, Bilibili rising around 10%, and JD.com rising around 5%.

The potential partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is driving the rally, as it could help Intel's operations in the US and fulfill the government's 'Made in America' goal. Analysts at Wolfe Research believe a manufacturing partnership between Intel and TSMC would be the best outcome for Intel, as it would help absorb Intel's fixed costs and drive foundry volume. However, the implementation of such a plan is not without its difficulties, including technical hurdles and antitrust issues. As Wolfe analysts said, 'The technical challenges would undoubtedly be high. But the stakes for INTC are high as well. And the incentive for TSMC would be capacity in the US, elimination of INTC as a competitor, and perhaps some U.S. Government support.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 12:51 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/intel-set-for-biggest-weekly-gain-in-40-years-on-potential-pact-with-tsmc-3870312)\n\n**TSMC's Leadership and Resilience: Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley Maintain 'Buy' Ratings**\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has been surrounded by rumors, including the US-China trade war, its partnership with Intel, and potential production capacity issues. Despite these concerns, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have released reports focusing on six key issues, reaffirming their 'buy' ratings and setting target prices of NT$140 and NT$154 respectively. The six key issues include TSMC's business strategy, its relationship with Intel, potential antitrust implications of their joint venture, production capacity and technology maturity, TSMC's expansion of US production capacity, and potential tariffs. According to the reports, TSMC's advanced process technology is a key competitive advantage, and it is unlikely to license its technology to competitors. Additionally, Morgan Stanley's analyst Chen Jia-yi pointed out that Intel's manufacturing ecosystem, design methods, and production patterns are significantly different from TSMC's, making it difficult for Intel to rapidly expand its foundry business. In terms of potential tariffs, Goldman Sachs' analyst L\u00fc K\u016bn-l\u00edn noted that most semiconductors are sent to downstream customers after being packaged and assembled, so TSMC will not be directly affected by tariffs. TSMC plans to increase its US production capacity by 2028 and 2030, with a total investment of over NT$650 billion in Arizona. Looking ahead, Goldman Sachs expects TSMC to maintain its leading position in the global foundry market, with a market share of over 60% in revenue. With its advanced technology and strong growth prospects in AI, 5G, HPC, and EV, TSMC's valuation is still attractive, with a price-to-earnings ratio of around 10-29 times, and a long-term gross margin of over 53%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 09:03 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5607/8548817)\n\n**Sources: Apple plans to launch its AI features in China as early as May 2024, using its own on-device models with Alibaba software to censor or filter AI output**\nApple is facing criticism in Germany over its App Tracking Transparency feature, with the country's antitrust agency releasing a preliminary finding that it uses the feature as a form of self-preferencing.

The 'antidumping' measure aims to prevent companies from exporting products at low prices, which can harm the local industry. According to the Ministry, the investigation was initiated due to indications that Chinese cartoncillo imports were made at discriminatory prices and posed a threat to the Mexican production branch. The Ministry stated that this measure provides 'an opportune defense to the productive plant against unfair imports' and invites Mexican producers, importers, and exporters, as well as the Chinese government, to present their arguments and evidence in defense of their interests. The investigation period spans from August 2019 to July 2024, during which time complaints were raised about the high volumes of Chinese cartoncillo imports at low prices compared to Mexican production costs.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 08:09 PM\nSource:[planoinformativo.com](https://planoinformativo.com/1056070/mexico-abre-investigacion-antidumping-a-importaciones-de-cartoncillo-de-china)\n\n**Opinion | How the trade war could expand beyond tariffs**\nThe United States' aggressive tariff policies could lead to a broader trade war, with other countries responding in various ways. China has already set retaliatory tariffs on American liquefied natural gas and crude oil, and is considering new antitrust investigations into Intel and Apple. Other countries may use workarounds to avoid US pressure, such as developing alternative infrastructure for global commerce, like the SWIFT system. They may also reduce their holdings of US debt, which could lead to increased interest rates. Additionally, other nations could move to reduce the US dollar's role in trade and lending, as China has been pushing for trade denominations to move from the dollar to the renminbi. 'The broadest category of responses involves workarounds to the ways the United States exerts pressure on other countries,' said the article. 'It's a truth worth remembering as the United States imposes substantially higher tariffs on our trading partners, who have the ability to respond in unanticipated ways.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/02/13/trade-war-tariffs-swift-dollar-china/)\n\n**After DeepSeek Shook Wall Street, China's Baidu Gears Up For AI Battle With Next-Gen Ernie 5.0 Launch In Late 2025 China's Baidu Prepares For Ernie 5.0 Launch In The Second Half Of 2025.

The investigation is related to SAMR's conditional clearance decision regarding NVIDIA's 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies. NVIDIA's ability to meet its supply obligations in mainland China is likely to face challenges due to the U.S. Department of Commerce's export restrictions on certain advanced computing integrated circuits and semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The investigation highlights the growing monopolistic concerns in the global chip industry and the escalating tech tensions between China and the U.S. The case may reach an impasse due to the inherent conflicts between China's AML and U.S. export control regulations, as well as the challenges and uncertainties involved in applying the principle of international comity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 07:14 AM\nSource:[Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=12beb217-fb29-4af4-bd65-b761708a0063)\n\n**China strikes back with $14bn in retaliatory tariffs on US goods**\nChina has imposed retaliatory tariffs on $14 billion worth of US goods, escalating trade tensions with Washington.

The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced on Tuesday that it had opened an investigation into Google's dominance of the Android operating system and any harm caused to Chinese phone manufacturers such as Oppo and Xiaomi. The regulators also announced a similar antitrust investigation into Nvidia in December, and are now considering a formal review of Intel. According to Liu Xu, a researcher at the National Strategy Institute of Tsinghua University, the investigations 'may be part of China's retaliatory measures' in response to Trump's new tariffs. Xu added that using antitrust investigations as a tool in trade negotiations 'may not be the best way to protect Chinese companies affected by US tariffs, as it would inevitably provoke controversy.' The move comes as tensions between the two global powers continue to escalate, with the US imposing stricter controls on the export of advanced chips to China. 'China is using its regulatory power to push back against the US,' said Xu. 'This is a new chapter in the trade war between the two countries.' The investigation into Google, which was first launched in 2019, was archived for years but was reopened in December, just before Trump's return to the White House. The SAMR visited Google's office in Beijing in January and demanded that the company provide information related to the investigation. 'Google is well welcome to continue growing its business in China,' said a Commerce Ministry official, days before the SAMR announcement. Nvidia, which is being investigated for alleged antitrust violations related to its acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2019, has seen its sales in China grow to 13% of its global revenue in the first three quarters of 2024. Intel, which has a significant presence in China, could face significant penalties if found guilty of antitrust violations, including fines linked to its global revenue or loss of access to the Chinese market.

The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced an antitrust investigation into Google, and the Financial Times reports that Intel may also face potential scrutiny. According to analysts, this move is a retaliatory measure against the US's comprehensive tariff increase. Sources close to the matter revealed that the focus of the investigation into Google will be on the company's Android operating system and the harm it has caused to Chinese smartphone manufacturers. One source stated that the Chinese government had previously launched a similar investigation into NVIDIA in December last year and is now considering launching a new investigation into Intel; however, the nature of the investigation and whether it has been launched may be affected by the current state of Sino-US relations. Dr. Liu Xue, a special researcher at the National Strategy Research Institute of Tsinghua University, believes that this investigation into American companies may be part of China's retaliation against the Trump administration's tariff increase. The two sources mentioned that China had first launched an investigation into Google in 2019, but it was put on hold for several years before being re-launched in December 2024. This move occurred before Trump's presidency, when Trump repeatedly threatened to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods during his presidential campaign. It was also revealed that before Trump took office, Chinese regulatory departments had visited Google's Beijing office, requesting relevant information. In December 2024, China also announced an investigation into NVIDIA. At the time, the outgoing Biden administration used its final months to strengthen controls on the export of advanced chips, attempting to hinder China's growing development of artificial intelligence. The Financial Times reports that antitrust investigations into American tech giants may result in fines related to global income or loss of market access in the world's largest international market, China.

This could be another step by China in response to the US administration's decision to impose higher tariffs on Chinese imports. The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) has been responding to the escalation of geopolitical tensions between China and the US. The potential investigation into Intel is part of a broader trend of antitrust investigations into many large American technology companies. SAMR has recently resumed a previously frozen investigation into Google's dominance of the Android operating system, which affected many Chinese smartphone manufacturers, such as Oppo and Xiaomi. The company has also recently launched an investigation into Nvidia, and today there are reports of another antitrust investigation into Google. The nature and scope of the investigation into Intel remain unclear, and depend on the future development of relations between the US and China. The timing and scope of the investigation may be influenced by the upcoming conversation between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and US President Trump. The decline in Intel's stock price reflects investors' concerns about the potential impact of a Chinese regulator's investigation on the company's operations on the significant Chinese market for semiconductor companies. As Xi Jinping said, 'The Chinese government will take all necessary measures to protect the interests of Chinese companies.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[3DNews - Daily Digital Digest](https://3dnews.ru/1117723/aktsii-intel-podesheveli-na-fone-vozmognogo-kitayskogo-antimonopolnogo-rassledovaniya-v-otnoshenii-kompanii)\n\n**Intel Faces Possible Investigation in China Amid US-China Trade Tensions**\nFollowing US President Trump's decision to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese goods, Beijing has taken retaliatory measures.

According to the Financial Times, citing sources, Chinese regulators are evaluating whether to formally launch an investigation into Intel, but the type of investigation is still unknown.
