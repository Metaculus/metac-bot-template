Currently, only one candidate, MP Chandra Arya, has officially announced their intention to run for the position. However, other notable politicians, including Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, Employment Minister Steven MacKinnon, Natural Resources Minister Jonathan Wilkinson, and Innovation Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, are also potential candidates. Trudeau's decision to step down comes after Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced her resignation in mid-December 2024.

However, the opposition parties have agreed to continue with the current parliament until March 24, 2025. The Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, has been gaining momentum and is now a strong contender for the election. The party's popularity has been boosted by the Liberal Party's internal struggles, including the departure of several key members. Trudeau has been accused of being a 'weak leader' and has been criticized for his handling of the economy. The election is expected to be a close contest between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party. Meanwhile, the NDP, led by Jagmeet Singh, has been struggling to gain traction and is currently polling at a low level. The election is scheduled to take place on October 20, 2025, but Trudeau has the power to call for an early election if he loses the confidence of the parliament. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our teachers and the dedication of our students,' said Sarah White, the head of education, in a statement. However, the opposition parties have accused Trudeau of being a 'dictator' and have vowed to challenge his authority. The election is expected to be a closely watched event, with many Canadians eager to see the outcome. 'The Conservative Party is gaining momentum and is now a strong contender for the election,' said Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservative Party. 'We are confident that we will win the election and form the next government.' However, the Liberal Party is not giving up easily and has vowed to fight hard to retain power. 'We are committed to serving the people of Canada and will do everything in our power to ensure that we are re-elected,' said Justin Trudeau, the Prime Minister. 'The election is a chance for Canadians to have their say and to choose the government that they want.' \nOriginal language: ta\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 09:32 PM\nSource:[yarl.com](https://yarl.com/forum3/topic/300209-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A9%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BE-%E0%AE%AE%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%AF-%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8D-2025-%E0%AE%AA%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%AE%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%A9%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%B0%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%87%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9F%E0%AE%BF%E0%AE%B5%E0%AF%8D-%E0%AE%95%E0%AE%9F%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%BF/)\n\n**Voting refresher: The Ontario Election 2025 is Thursday Feb. 27**\nOn Thursday, February 27, the Ontario Election 2025 will take place.

The Chief Electoral Officer determines the number of seats in the House of Commons based on population counts from the decennial census. The federal electoral boundaries commissions, independent bodies, make decisions regarding the proposed and final federal electoral boundaries. The 2023 Representation Order, proclaimed on September 22, 2023, increased the number of FEDs to 343, with Alberta gaining three additional seats and Ontario and British Columbia each gaining one seat. The representation order is in force on the first dissolution of Parliament that occurs at least seven months after its proclamation, which is on or after April 23, 2024. The names of FEDs may change at any time through an Act of Parliament, as stated by the Chief Electoral Officer. 'The 2023 Representation Order is a significant step in ensuring fair and accurate representation of Canadians in the House of Commons,' said the Chief Electoral Officer. 'The new electoral boundaries will provide a more accurate reflection of Canada's population and will help to ensure that every Canadian has an equal voice in our democracy.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 01:35 PM\nSource:[open.canada.ca](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/18bf3ea7-1940-46ec-af52-9ba3f77ed708)\n\n**Ford Likely to Announce Early Elections Amid Trump Tariff Threat**\nOntario Premier Doug Ford is likely to announce early elections on January 29 or February 5, according to sources. Ford plans to use the threat of Trump's tariffs as a reason to send Ontarians to the polls early. Ford called a 'super-meeting' with all PC members on Saturday. Trump signed an order on Monday to investigate alleged unfair trade practices by Canada and Mexico and present a report by April 1. Later that day, he mentioned imposing 25% tariffs on both countries on February 1, accusing the federal government of allowing illegal migrants and drugs to enter the US through the Canadian border. 'To protect jobs, we may need billions of dollars. We need a mandate. And only people can give it to us, that's democracy,' Ford said. NDP leader Marit Stiles believes a mandate is not necessary, pointing out that Ford already has a majority. 'It's all about Ford wanting more mandates, although he already has a majority. It's not about opposing Trump. For example, Ford didn't need a mandate from the people to spend $2.2 billion (400 dollars per family) on subsidizing a luxury spa in downtown Toronto. He never asked for permission for this,' Stiles said. 'This is just a pretext to hold elections when no one is paying attention.' Ford is not required to hold elections until June 2026, but he can send Ontarians to the polls as early as February 27 or March 6 in a rare winter election campaign. 'I'm ready to go to the polls at any moment, as soon as the premier tells us,' said Vic Fedeli, Ontario's Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. According to a new Leger poll, PC members are leading Liberals by 24 points, which would be enough for Ford to get another majority in the provincial parliament.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[torontovka.com](https://torontovka.com/news/canada/2025-01-23/sledite-za-obnovleniyami-skoree-vsego-ford-obyavit-dosrochnye-vybory-uzhe-na-sleduyuschej-nedel-122325)\n\n**Canada Braces for Turbulent 2025**\nCanada is bracing for a tumultuous year in 2025, with several key events on the horizon. Donald Trump's inauguration as US President on January 20 is expected to have a significant impact on Canada, with the new administration threatening to use economic pressure to annex Canada. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced his resignation, with a leadership election to take place on March 9. Several high-profile candidates, including Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland, have already launched their campaigns. The federal election, originally scheduled for October 20, 2025, may be brought forward if the new Liberal leader decides to call an election. In Quebec, the Liberal Party is holding a leadership election, with four candidates vying for the top spot. The province is also facing two by-elections, in Terrebonne and Arthabaska, which could be influenced by the federal election. The Quebec government is preparing a budget that will aim to balance the books by 2029-2030, and Montreal is holding municipal elections on November 2, which will mark the end of Mayor Val\u00e9rie Plante's era.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[La Presse.ca](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/politique/2025-01-17/2025-annee-de-ruptures.php)\n\n**Trudeau minister BEGS MPs not to pursue a spring election**\nPublic Safety Minister David McGuinty urged caution against a spring election, saying 'This is a mature democracy and we can do both.

Health Minister Mark Holland also rejected calls for a snap election, saying 'Every four years you get an election, like democracy's not going anywhere folks.' The Liberal Party is facing internal divisions and opposition from the Bloc Quebecois and New Democrats, who have expressed interest in backing a new Liberal leader for another minority government.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[rebelnews.com](https://www.rebelnews.com/trudeau_minister_begs_mps_not_to_pursue_a_spring_election)\n\n**Prorogation of Parliament: Uncertainty for Projects in the National Capital Region**\nThe announcement of Justin Trudeau's departure and the decision to prorogue Parliament until March 24 has added uncertainty to the plans of some elected officials in the National Capital Region. The suspension of the parliamentary session and the upcoming elections could slow down or even jeopardize certain projects that were recently announced in the region. According to Liberal MP Sophie Chatel, the funding for the Ottawa portion of the Gatineau tramway has not been secured, despite the announcement of $31.6 million over three years in the government's economic statement on December 16. 'I hope that as soon as Parliament resumes after March 23, we will have votes on these envelopes,' she said. Gatineau city councillor Daniel Champagne assured that his colleagues and he will defend the project in the event of federal elections. 'I dare hope that the candidates who will replace the current government will reaffirm this intention, considering the priorities of Gatineau citizens,' he said. The funding for the project of a 6th bridge between Gatineau and Ottawa, also announced on December 16, has never been secured by a vote in the House. Sophie Chatel said she will continue to fight for these two projects. From the other side of the river, Ottawa Mayor Mark Sutcliffe expressed hope that the federal government will grant the money he has been asking for months to fill the deficit in his 2025 budget, particularly due to public transportation. After weeks of uncertainty, he said he is now relieved that Justin Trudeau did not trigger early winter elections as some scenarios had suggested. According to him, the prorogation of Parliament will give his administration and the federal government a bit more time to come to an agreement. 'We have made a lot of progress in our conversations in November and December,' he explained. 'So I hope we are near the finish line and there will be an announcement in the coming weeks. We have a strong presence in the Liberal cabinet with two ministers from Ottawa,' said Liberal MP Yasir Naqvi. 'We are working together for the city of Ottawa and this work will continue to the benefit of Ottawa people.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 10:57 AM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2131039/avenir-tramway-pont-gatineau-ottawa-prorogation)\n\n**Justin Trudeau's Resignation: What's Next for Canada?**\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Party and will continue to serve as Prime Minister until a new leader is elected. The new leader will automatically become the Prime Minister until the next federal election. According to the Liberal Party's rules, the party leader must call a national council meeting within 27 days of announcing their resignation. The national council will then appoint an interim leader to oversee party affairs until a new leader is elected. The new leader will be chosen through a national election process, which typically takes several months. However, the Liberal Party may be able to choose a new leader by the end of March before the parliamentary session resumes. Potential candidates for the new leader include current Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, current Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, former Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, former British Columbia Premier Christy Clark, and former Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney. The parliamentary session has been adjourned until March 24, giving the Liberal Party time to choose a new leader before facing a confidence vote. If the Liberal Party-led government fails to pass a confidence vote, the earliest possible date for a new federal election is May. The US factor may also impact Canada's future, as the new US government may impose tariffs on Canadian imports. US President-elect Donald Trump has previously stated that he will impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian imports after taking office in 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 05:44 AM\nSource:[big5.cctv.com](https://big5.cctv.com/gate/big5/news.cctv.com/2025/01/07/ARTINsun8ohb1en5TLqNIt97250107.shtml)\n\n**Key Political Events to Watch in Canada in 2025**\nIn 2025, Canadians will head to the polls multiple times at both the federal and local levels.

The next federal election must take place by October 20, 2025. In the country, the campaign period is at least 36 days and no more than 50 days, according to Elections Canada. The Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) will try to slow down its decline in popularity and keep the Terrebonne seat, vacant since Pierre Fitzgibbon's resignation. The Parti qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ), which is gaining momentum, is eyeing the seat in its former stronghold and will present its national executive council president, Catherine Gentilcore. The date of the by-election is not yet known, but the government has six months to call a vote after a member's departure. Municipal elections will take place on November 2, marking the end of an era for some politicians who want to turn the page on this chapter of their careers. In Montreal, Val\u00e9rie Plante has already announced that she will not seek a third term as mayor. Several candidates have already declared their intention to try their luck to take her place at the head of Projet Montr\u00e9al and a leadership contest is underway. The opposition party Ensemble Montr\u00e9al has postponed its own leadership contest and extended the call for candidates. Longueuil Mayor Catherine Fournier will try to be re-elected in the fall. In Quebec City, Mayor Bruno Marchand, who will be a candidate for re-election, will face three opposition parties, including two that could count on the candidacy of former politician Sam Hamad to boost their popularity. The Alberta government of Danielle Smith has legislated earlier in 2024 to allow the creation of political parties in Calgary and Edmonton, where about half of the province's population lives. This pilot project also allows aspiring politicians to run within a political formation without being required to do so. Calgary Mayor Jyoti Gondek has declared her intention to run for re-election. Her announced opponents are Jeff Davison, who lost to Gondek four years ago, and former Calgary Police Commission president Dan McLean.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 02:49 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/rci/fr/nouvelle/2129492/calendier-politique-canada-elections)\n\n**Local stories to watch in 2025 | CBC News**\nIn 2025, several local stories are expected to unfold in the Ottawa area. A federal election must be held by late October, and most local incumbents have announced their intention to run again. Quebec's municipal elections will take place on November 2, while Ontario's election is due by June 2026, although it could be held earlier. The Ottawa Rapid pro women's soccer team and the Ironman triathlon will debut in April and August, respectively. Major legal matters to watch include the decision for convoy leaders Tamara Lich and Chris Barber in March and the trial of the man accused of the March 2024 Barrhaven mass killing in November. The first two sections of the Stage 2 light rail expansion are scheduled to open this year, and the city is hoping to open its tent-like asylum seeker support centre near the Nepean Sportsplex. The Thunderhead monument recognizing people affected by 2SLGBTQ+ discrimination is expected to open this summer. The city is also putting out its full transportation master plan for the next 20+ years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2025 09:03 AM\nSource:[CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-gatineau-2025-news-stories-preview-1.7406414)\n\n**Canada\u2019s Next Election Will Be Like None Before**\nThe Tyee is preparing for Canada's upcoming federal election, which will be unlike any previous one. With Justin Trudeau's government on the brink of collapse, a federal contest is expected soon. The Tyee aims to provide investigative, fact-based, and hard-hitting reporting, similar to their coverage of the 2020 British Columbia election. The conversation this election will spark is crucial, as Christopher Holcroft notes, with Canada's sovereignty and basic assumptions about governance at stake. The Tyee will be monitoring online chatter and disinformation, as American influencers like Joe Rogan and Elon Musk attempt to sway Canadian voters. The news industry is facing financial losses and shrinking newsrooms, making independent journalism more important than ever. The Tyee relies on reader support to remain independent and is asking for contributions to fund their work in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 12:10 AM\nSource:[thetyee.ca](https://www.thetyee.ca/Tyeenews/2024/12/30/Canada-Next-Election-Like-None-Before/)\n\n",
