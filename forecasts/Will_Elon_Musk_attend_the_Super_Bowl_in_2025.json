This comes as the AI sector has seen significant investment in advertising, with companies like Google, Anthropic, and Microsoft investing $332 million in 2024, as reported by Reuters. Another AI company, Perplexity, will also be present at the Super Bowl, with a customized Tesla Cybertruck activation aimed at generating buzz on social media before the game. Perplexity was in negotiations with Fox, the game's broadcaster, for an official commercial, but instead invested around $3 million in adjacent marketing, filming a web series with sports influencers inside the company's Elon Musk-owned vehicle. The Super Bowl is a highly sought-after event for advertisers, with 123 million people expected to watch the 2024 game, surpassing the 2023 record of 115 million, according to Nielsen data. The price of a 30-second ad spot has exceeded $8 million, according to a source familiar with the negotiations.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[meioemensagem.com.br](https://www.meioemensagem.com.br/marketing/openai-publicidade-super-bowl)\n\n**Super Bowl 2025: Everything You Need to Know About the Big NFL Final**\nThe US Secret Service has confirmed that they have deployed personnel to the Caesars Superdome to ensure the security of the Super Bowl 2025 event. According to spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi, 'security measures have been improved even further this year, as it will be the first time a sitting president attends the event'. Donald Trump is expected to give an interview with Bret Baier of Fox News, which will be recorded from Florida before the game. However, Trump has remained tight-lipped about his preference between the teams: 'I don't want to say it, but there's a certain quarterback who seems like a good winner', he said in reference to Patrick Mahomes, quarterback of the Chiefs. Lionel Messi has confirmed that he will be attending the event, despite being focused on the 2025 season with Inter Miami in the MLS. The news has generated a lot of excitement among fans and players, with Patrick Mahomes expressing his enthusiasm: 'Having someone of Messi's caliber watching the game will be incredible. I'm excited to show who I am and the talent I have', he said in a press conference. The presence of Messi adds to the already high-profile nature of the event, which will also feature a halftime show with Kendrick Lamar and SZA, and millions of viewers worldwide.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 02:45 PM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/protagonistas/super-bowl-2025-todo-lo-que-debes-saber-sobre-la-gran-final-de-la-nfl.phtml)\n\n**OpenAI to Air First-Ever TV Commercial During Super Bowl**\nOpenAI, the company behind the development of ChatGPT, is set to air its first-ever television commercial during the Super Bowl on February 9.

What a great team, coach, quarterback, and almost everything else, including those fantastic fans. Congratulations to the Buffalo Bills for a tremendous season. They're going to win a lot in the future!!!' When asked about the likely winner of the Super Bowl, Trump replied, 'I don't want to say, but there's a certain quarterback who seems like a good winner,' which is believed to be a reference to Patrick Mahomes.

ByteDance, the company behind TikTok, is hoping for a last-minute reversal of the law, but experts believe the Supreme Court will not intervene. In response, ByteDance is considering suspending TikTok services in the US, which would leave users without access to trends and content. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has expressed interest in saving TikTok by vetoing the law, and Elon Musk has been mentioned as a potential buyer. Additionally, streaming platforms are increasingly being used to broadcast live sports events, with the Super Bowl LIX set to be streamed on Tubi in 2025. However, this trend raises concerns about user experience and potential anticompetitive practices by major sports networks. Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced the launch of a new region in Mexico, which is expected to boost business and innovation in the country.

According to Musk, the probability of AI surpassing human intelligence by 2030 is 100%. Musk believes that AI will become so powerful that it will surpass the knowledge and abilities of all humans by 2027. He wrote on X, 'It is becoming increasingly likely that artificial intelligence will surpass the intelligence of any individual human by the end of 2025, and possibly all people by 2027/2028. The probability of AI surpassing the intelligence of all humans by 2030 is around 100%.' If these predictions come true, it could lead to the creation of a superintelligence that will continue to evolve and improve itself in an infinite loop, creating a new era of human evolution and potentially leading to an 'intelligence explosion' that will change the course of history.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 24, 2024 12:23 PM\nSource:[intvua.com](https://intvua.com/obshhestvo/2024/12/24/ii-stanet-ymnee-cheloveka-yje-k-2025-gody-a-k-2030-gody-obgonit-vse-chelovechestvo-ilon-mask.html)\n\n**Elon Musk's 2025 Prediction: A Superintelligent AI on the Horizon**\nElon Musk, the visionary entrepreneur behind Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink, has made a new prediction that has shaken the technological landscape. According to Musk, by 2025, a superintelligent artificial intelligence (AI) could emerge, surpassing human intelligence. This hypothesis raises concerns not only about the rapid development of technology but also about the ethical, social, and economic implications that follow. Musk has stated that AI is evolving much faster than expected, and if this growth continues, we may see the birth of machines with superior reasoning capabilities by next year. Musk has previously warned about the risks associated with AI, comparing its potential to apocalyptic scenarios like those depicted in the Terminator film series. However, this prediction is different because it is now imminent, not a distant future. Musk has highlighted the technological challenges related to this rapid development, including the consumption of resources. For example, training advanced models like Grok 2 required around 20,000 Nvidia chips, while the next version, Grok 3, will need 100,000 H100 chips. This data not only underscores the increasing computational power required but also raises questions about the environmental impact and accessibility of technological resources. Additionally, there are ethical concerns about an AI that could acquire a level of autonomy that would make it difficult for humans to control. Musk has often emphasized the need for strict regulation to ensure that AI is developed responsibly. The implications of this prediction are far-reaching, affecting not only the job market but also the economy and society as a whole. Musk has suggested that, in the event of widespread automation, a universal basic income might be necessary to support those affected by technological unemployment. The growth of a superintelligent AI could also fundamentally alter the balance of power between nations, companies, and individuals, creating new geopolitical dynamics. As Musk's prediction suggests, the question is no longer 'if' but 'when'. This prediction is not only a warning but also an opportunity to reflect on how to manage this extraordinary transformation. If preparing for the worst means acting today for a safer tomorrow, then it is our duty to face these challenges with foresight and responsibility.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 01:36 PM\nSource:[supereva.it](https://www.supereva.it/elon-musk-accadra-nel-2025-previsione-agghiacciante-sullintelligenza-artificiale-ci-prepariamo-al-peggio-90758)\n\n**Elon Musk's SpaceX Powers Up Super Heavy Rocket for Critical 7th Test**\nElon Musk's SpaceX has successfully completed a static-fire test of the Super Heavy booster, a crucial milestone for the upcoming seventh test flight of its Starship Megarocket.
