According to Vognsen, Apple will focus on releasing an ultra-thin iPhone model, possibly called iPhone 17 Slim or Air, which will be the thinnest on the market. Additionally, Apple will expand its 'Smart Home' ecosystem with a range of new products, including a 'HomeHub' solution that will serve as the digital hub of the home. This will allow users to control all their Smart Home functions, including lighting, temperature, and security, using a highly upgraded version of Siri. Vognsen also mentions that Apple will release a doorbell that can be used for FaceTime calls and will allow users to unlock their front door using their FaceID. Furthermore, Apple's AI-functionality, which was delayed in Europe due to regulatory uncertainty, is expected to be released in April, although the exact features are still unknown.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 09:10 PM\nSource:[Ekstra Bladet](https://ekstrabladet.dk/forbrug/Teknologi/ekspertens-bud-det-satser-apple-benhaardt-paa/10511736)\n\n**iOS 18.4 Update: Apple Expected To Launch 1st Beta Next Week, Roll Out Final Update in April 2025; Check Anticipated Apple Intelligence Features and Upgrades | \ud83d\udcf2 LatestLY**\nApple is expected to release the first beta version of iOS 18.4 next week, with a final update scheduled for April 2025.

Apple Maps has already started displaying the new name, but only when specifically searched for. The change will be applied globally, but with some exceptions. In Google Maps, US users will only see the new name, while users outside the US will see both the old and new names. Mexican users will still see the old name. Apple Maps currently displays the old name, but shows the new name when searched for. It is assumed that Apple will follow Google's approach and update the name once the change is made in the US government's database. The renaming was made official by a decree signed by former US President Trump on January 20, 2025, which also renamed the Mount McKinley in Alaska to Denali. According to the US government, the renaming aims to 'restore names that praise America's greatness'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[curved.de](https://curved.de/news/golf-von-amerika-google-maps-und-apple-maps-ziehen-mit-770002)\n\n**Apple and Google Update Maps to Reflect Name Changes**\nFollowing Donald Trump's decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the 'Gulf of America' and Mount McKinley to 'Mount McKinley', Apple and Google have been updating their maps to reflect the changes.

Google Maps, on the other hand, has decided to display different names for the Gulf of Mexico depending on the region, listing the US as a 'sensitive' area. In the German version of Apple Maps, the name 'Gulf of Mexico' remains unchanged, while Google Maps also displays 'Gulf of Mexico' when searching for 'Gulf of America'. However, Apple Maps does display the correct name 'Denali' for the mountain, while Google Maps still shows 'Mount McKinley'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[macwelt.de](https://www.macwelt.de/article/2592683/gulf-of-america-apple.html)\n\n**Apple Maps may have a solution for new Gulf of Mexico name**\nApple Maps has made a change to address the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to Gulf of America, but it's unclear if this is a permanent solution or a placeholder.

In response, Google announced that it will update Google Maps to reflect the changes once the US official geographic name system (GNIS) confirms them, which should occur within 30 days. Although the decree does not obligate companies to adopt the new names, Google stated that it will follow its practice of using official government designations. For US users, the new names will appear as 'Gulf of America' and 'Mount McKinley.' Internationally, Google Maps will display both names, along with globally recognized names, such as 'Gulf of Mexico.' The change raises questions about the impact of national policies on global tools. The Google emphasized that it will maintain its standard approach of displaying both names in cases of discrepancies between countries. Additionally, Meta has filed a complaint with the CADE against Apple, questioning the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) policy introduced by Apple in 2021. Meta argues that Apple applies less restrictive rules to its own apps, while third-party apps face explicit pop-ups. The case is part of investigations in France, Germany, and the US, where the Department of Justice is examining ATT as a possible abuse of dominant position by Apple. The move follows Mercado Livre's complaint to the CADE, resulting in a preventive measure against Apple. Furthermore, the social networking app Peanut, created by Michelle Kennedy, is expanding its operations to Brazil, driven by user requests and research highlighting a strong taboo surrounding motherhood in the country. The app offers a safe and welcoming environment for discussing topics like mental health, childbirth, and menopause, and has over 3 million monthly users and $30 million in investments.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 10:10 AM\nSource:[TecMundo](https://www.tecmundo.com.br/mercado/401955-o-tinder-para-mamaes-esta-chegando-ao-brasil---the-brief-2901.htm)\n\n**Google Maps to Display 'Gulf of America' in US, Following US Government Request**\nGoogle Maps will display the 'Gulf of America' name for the Gulf of Mexico in the US, following a request from the US government.

The change will only be visible to users in the US, while users in Mexico and other countries will see both 'Gulf of Mexico' and 'Gulf of America' with the latter in parentheses. This modification is part of Google's practice of updating names when they are changed in official government sources. The change is expected to be made when the US updates its official maps, and Google will follow suit. The New York Times reported that Google will make the changes 'quickly' to reflect the name change in the body of water shared by countries such as Mexico, the US, and Cuba.

The reason for this delay is not just political, but also due to the complexity of cartography. Maps are not just static images, but massive databases that are constantly updated. Changing a name on a map involves modifying a large amount of data, from geographic databases to user interfaces. Apple Maps is guided by international standards, established by organizations such as the United Nations Group of Experts on Geographical Names (UNGEGN), which aim to ensure consistency and accuracy in the representation of places on maps. Changing the name of a place with such historical significance, like the Gulf of Mexico, would require an international consensus, which is a long and complex process. 'The names of geographical places are subject to international standards,' said an Apple spokesperson. 'We take into account the importance of historical and cultural significance when updating our maps.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[ipadizate.com](https://ipadizate.com/apple/apple-maps-sigue-llamandolo-golfo-de-mexico-en-vez-de-golfo-de-america-por-mucho-que-quiera-trump)\n\n**Apple Resists Trump's 'Gulf of America' Decree in Apple Maps**\nUS President Donald Trump has signed a decree to rename parts of the US coastline and adjacent waters to 'Gulf of America'.

Just noticed that Apple Maps still calls it 'Gulf of Mexico'. Thought you should know.' Users quickly added to the 'Community Notes' with additional information, pointing out that the decree orders the Interior Ministry to take action within 30 days to rename the US coastline to 'Gulf of America'. The decree does not apply to the entire Gulf of Mexico, but only to the US continental shelf, bounded by the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida.

Florida has become the first state government to follow Trump's policy, with Governor Ron DeSantis using the term 'Gulf of America' to highlight extreme weather conditions in the region. Tech companies like Apple and Google still display the body of water as the 'Gulf of Mexico,' with some social media users ridiculing the change. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and tech influencer Andrew Chen were among those who found the change amusing.
