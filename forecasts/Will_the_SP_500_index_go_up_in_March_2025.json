The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 302.85 points or 0.7 percent to 43,735.97, while the S&P 500 fell 4.51 points or 0.1 percent to 5,951.55 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 126.86 points or 0.7 percent to 18,948.40. The market's mixed performance was influenced by earnings news from Nvidia, which reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results but warned about increased global competition. President Donald Trump's announcement that previously paused tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada will go into effect on March 4th also contributed to the market's volatility. Additionally, traders were digesting the latest U.S. economic data, including a Labor Department report showing a surge in first-time claims for unemployment benefits and a Commerce Department report showing a significant increase in durable goods orders.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 04:12 PM\nSource:[rttnews.com](https://www.rttnews.com/3517237/s-p-500-little-changed-amid-volatility-on-wall-street.aspx)\n\n**Economic Uncertainty May Stall S&P 500 Before Spring Rebound**\nAccording to Ilan Benhamou from JPMorgan, the S&P 500 index may experience stagnation in March due to weakening economic data, but he anticipates a rebound later in the spring. Benhamou notes that the market needs to reach a technically oversold level before recovery, and suggests that retail investors will be exhausted and commodity trading advisors will face financial constraints. However, he predicts that the S&P 500 will rise again by the end of March or early April, driven by improved liquidity, reduced macroeconomic uncertainty, and continued resilience in U.S. corporate earnings. In the mid-term, Benhamou is optimistic about the S&P 500's upward trajectory and expects yields to decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:56 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2719089/economic-uncertainty-may-stall-sp-500-before-spring-rebound)\n\n**US Stocks to Face Pressure in Early March, JP Morgan Analyst Predicts**\nJP Morgan analyst Eylon Benhamou expects the US stocks to face pressure in early March due to weak economic data, before rising again later this spring. According to a note to clients this week, Benhamou wrote, 'In the near future, stocks will not rise significantly and may be volatile, and I believe the market will be stuck at certain levels.' He added that the S&P 500 index will rise again in late March and early April as liquidity improves and companies' earnings show that US entities have the flexibility to handle different economic pressures.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:09 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0623\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629](https://www.argaam.com/ar/article/articledetail/id/1793666)\n\n**US Stock Market in a 'Bear Market' - JPMorgan Analyst Predicts Recovery in Late March**\nJPMorgan analyst Ilan Benhamou believes that the US stock market will continue to struggle and may be in a 'bear market' due to the uncertainty caused by US President Donald Trump's policies, including tariffs, immigration, and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Benhamou wrote in a client note, 'In the near future, the situation is too chaotic for stocks to rise, and I think the markets are stuck.' The S&P 500 has been in a sideways range since November and is being outperformed by international stock markets. Benhamou expects the market to reach a point where technical data appears overbought and over sold, causing a new rally. He notes that the Fear and Greed Index is already in the 'extreme fear' range and investor sentiment is 20% bulls and 60% bears. Benhamou predicts that the S&P 500 could recover in late March or early April, citing improved liquidity, a decrease in macroeconomic surplus, and increasing corporate profits.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[finanzmarktwelt.de](https://finanzmarktwelt.de/keine-rallye-jpmorgan-sieht-us-aktienmaerkte-in-der-klemme-340668/)\n\n**US Stock Market May Experience Difficulties in Early March: JPMorgan**\nAccording to Ilan Benhamou, a JPMorgan Chase & Co. employee, the US stock market may experience difficulties in early March due to weak economic indicators. However, the situation may improve later in the spring, and stocks may start growing again. The S&P 500 index has been lagging behind international markets this year due to uncertainty surrounding US President Donald Trump's policies, including tariffs, immigration, and job cuts in the federal government as part of Elon Musk's DOGE program. Benhamu wrote in a note to clients this week, 'The situation will be too complicated for stocks to grow in the near future, and I think the market is stuck.' Recent layoffs and measures taken by the DOGE team will put additional pressure on the macroeconomic picture. Consumer surveys are expected to decline, and questions about inflation will remain relevant. Stocks will need to reach a point where 'technical indicators will be blurred and sold,' Benhamu said. 'Retail investors will be exhausted, and CTAs will be more exhausted.' However, Benhamu believes that the S&P 500 index can grow in late March and early April. 'Liquidity improves, macroeconomic overhang clears, corporate America's earnings continue to show resilience, bleeding stops, and retail sales return to the table,' he said. Nvidia Corp's earnings remain stable but do not show significant growth. Risks and uncertainty surrounding tariffs continue to put pressure on overall risk appetite. Seasonality in March is weak, making the prospects for stocks in the coming weeks uncertain. 'In the medium term, I am confident that SPX will grow, and yields will decrease,' Benhamu said.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-2672473)\n\n**Experts Predict 9% Rise in US Stocks in 2025, but Trump Policies Pose Risk**\nAccording to a survey of 54 stock market experts by Reuters, the S&P 500 index is expected to rise by around 9% in 2025, reaching a potential high of 6,500 points. The experts cited two main drivers of this optimism: the US's lead in AI technology and President Trump's pro-business policies, which include plans to lower corporate tax rates. However, the experts also warned that Trump's policies, including frequent threats of tariffs and large-scale layoffs, could increase market volatility. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell to 98.3 in February, a 7-point drop from the previous month and the lowest level in eight months, indicating that Trump's policies have had a significant negative impact on consumer confidence.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 02:25 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://finance.technews.tw/2025/02/27/sp-500-to-end-2025-up-9-percent-from-here/)\n\n**Wall Street Closes Mixed as S&P 500 and Nasdaq Recover from Four-Day Losing Streak**\nThe New York Stock Exchange closed in a mixed state on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices recovering from four consecutive days of losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.43% to 43,433 points, while the S&P 500 rose 0.01% to 5,956 points, and the Nasdaq rose 0.26% to 19,075 units. Investors were watching the results of Nvidia, a microchip company, which reported a 3.67% increase after releasing positive results. The market was also influenced by news from the White House, where President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico if they do not demonstrate progress in controlling drug trafficking by March 4. Trump also announced that the US will impose a 25% tariff on the EU for 'automobiles and other things' due to a $300 billion trade deficit. However, according to the US Trade Representative's website, the US trade deficit with the EU in 2024 was actually $235.6 billion. The personal consumption expenditure price index for January will be released on Friday, a key inflation measure followed by the Federal Reserve, although interest rates are not expected to be lowered in the near future.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:41 AM\nSource:[finanzasdigital.com](https://finanzasdigital.com/cierre-mixto-bolsa-nueva-york/)\n\n**Futures dip as markets weigh trade risks, Nvidia down before results**\nU.S. stock index futures slipped on Tuesday, led by weakness across chip companies and megacaps, as investors digested fresh tariff comments from President Donald Trump and Nvidia dropped 1.5% a day ahead of its results. The Dow E-minis were down 28 points, or 0.06%, S&P 500 E-minis were down 12.5 points, or 0.21%, and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were down 81.25 points, or 0.38%. Investors assessed a report that the U.S. was planning to further restrict the quantity and types of Nvidia chips that can be exported to China without a license. Nvidia's results on Wednesday will be key for the sector, at a time when investors are questioning the industry's hefty spending on AI. President Trump said late on Monday that tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports were 'on time and on schedule', ahead of a March 4 deadline. The U.S. and China are already in a trade war. Trump also signed an order over the weekend to restrict Chinese investments in strategic areas including semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum, biotechnology and aerospace. Wall Street's three main indexes are poised for declines in 2025. Interest rate futures currently point to a cut of 25 basis points in July and traders are pricing in another reduction before the end of the year. Crypto stocks also fell, with Coinbase down 6% and MicroStrategy down 6.9% tracking bitcoin prices that touched a more than three-month low.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 12:28 PM\nSource:[zawya.com](https://www.zawya.com/en/capital-markets/equities/futures-dip-as-markets-weigh-trade-risks-nvidia-down-before-results-rza9hjb1)\n\n**Why Are US Stock Futures Rising on Monday? - Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY)**\nUS stock futures rose on Monday, following Friday's selloff. Investor anxiety over tariffs and a 10% drawdown in consumer sentiment data on Friday raised fears of a market correction. Nvidia Corporation is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings this week, with analysts expecting guidance that 'DeepSeek won't kill spending on AI infrastructure, including datacenters.' The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 4.44%, while the two-year yield was at 4.22%. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, there is a 97.5% chance that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged for the March meeting. Consumer staples stocks were in a bright spot, while information technology, consumer discretionary, and industrial sectors led the S&P 500's overall decline on Friday. Shares of UnitedHealth Group Inc. fell over 7% following a Wall Street Journal report that the Department of Justice is investigating the company's Medicare billing practices. Ed Yardeni of Yardeni Research said, 'Sentiment turned very bearish very quickly at the end of last week because investors aren't as sure about the economy's resilience as we are.' Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates quoted the above data and said, 'The AI boom is here and now, and this means that the job market is going to go through some real upheaval in 2025 and beyond.' Charlie Bilello, the chief market strategist at Creative Planning, highlighted that the Nasdaq 100 was trading above its 200-day moving average for 489 consecutive sessions, which was its second highest in history since 1986.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 11:24 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/25/02/43907808/wall-street-looks-to-bounce-back-after-fridays-rough-ride-triggered-by-consumer-sentiment-analyst-says-we-continue-to-place-our-bets-on-economys-resilience)\n\n**US Stock Market's 'Animal Spirit' Spreads Globally, But Some Experts Warn of a Reversal**\nThe 'animal spirit' that drove the US stock market to surge over the past two years is now spreading globally, with some market experts suggesting that this trend may be just beginning. The S&P 500 index has risen over 50% in 2023 and 2024, but has been relatively flat since President Trump's inauguration. Now, investors are flocking to European and Asian stock markets, ignoring tariffs, trade wars, and military conflicts. The Euro Stoxx 600 index has risen 5.8% since Trump's inauguration, while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon index has surged 18%. In contrast, the S&P 500 index has risen only 0.3% over the same period, and fell 1.7% last week. Brad Conger, an investment manager at Hirtle Callaghan, believes that the reversal of this trend may continue for a long time, given the extreme market sentiment and holding period in the US. He has been overweighting European and Chinese stocks since mid-2024. Conger cited a Goldman Sachs survey in January, which found that most global portfolio managers expect the US stock market to deliver the best returns in 2025. This one-sided atmosphere is one of the reasons for his contrarian approach. Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide Investment Management Group, believes that this shift may be long-term, rather than cyclical. The group manages around $75 billion in assets. Over the past two years, global stock markets have lagged far behind the US, with the Euro Stoxx 600 index rising 20%, the Nasdaq Golden Dragon index rising only 1%, and the S&P 500 index surging 53%. Even in 2025, when the European index caught up, its average price-to-earnings ratio was still 14, lower than the S&P 500's 22. The Chinese index was 17. The flow of funds shows that non-US stocks have a lot of potential. Citigroup said that positions have been 'significantly' shifted in favor of Europe, with investors now more bullish on Europe than on the US. The upcoming March is the US tax season, which will bring another negative factor to the S&P 500 index. Scott Rubner of Goldman Sachs said that he is watching for a 'pullback' in the index, as both retail and institutional investors have lost momentum. Christopher Murphy of Susquehanna International Group noted that the influx of investors into German stocks or broader European stocks indicates that investors are worried about missing out on opportunities. He pointed out that the implicit volatility of the German DAX index and the Euro Stoxx 50 index has surged in recent weeks. Murphy added that a situation where a macro index rises and volatility increases significantly is extremely rare. However, there is fundamental support behind it. In addition to the European valuation lag, interest rate prospects are more favorable, and corporate earnings remain resilient. The growing optimism surrounding a possible ceasefire in Ukraine is also a positive factor, as well as the expectation of increased spending to maintain peace, which is particularly beneficial for European defense companies. But for some, the influx of investors into Europe and China has been too strong, and perhaps it's time to take a break. Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou of Morgan Stanley said that the momentum indicators of the Euro Stoxx 50 index and the Hang Seng China Enterprises index suggest that they have risen too quickly and may be about to reverse, even if it's not immediately.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The market's ability to withstand adversity has increased investor confidence that the bullish trend will continue, unless a significant negative surprise occurs. Additionally, the market's breadth is favorable, as a larger percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 are contributing to the index's rise, unlike in 2024 when the 'Magnificent Seven' drove the gains. Options traders are 'betting' that the tech giants will continue to rise, with over $40 billion in option contracts changing hands last week, the largest amount so far this year. Meta Platforms and Microsoft have seen increased option activity, with Meta's reaching its highest level since April 2024 and Microsoft's since the summer of 2023. To diversify and reduce dependence on the tech sector, investors can consider the Franklin International Low Volatility High Dividend fund, which invests in strong countries outside the US. The fund has seen over $700 million in inflows in 2024 and has $1.7 billion in assets under management, with a 5-star rating from Morningstar. Vital Farms, a US-based egg and butter company, has seen its stock rise 157% in the last year and is expected to report a 48.44% increase in earnings per share on March 6, with a price target of $47.86.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 05:51 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/analysis/esto-es-todo-lo-que-pueden-hacer-para-hundir-el-mercado-200475044)\n\n**January Barometer Predicts Gains for 2025**\nThe January Barometer suggests gains for 2025 after a 3.2% increase in the S&P 500 in January. Jeffrey Hirsch predicts a growth of 8% to 12% in 2025, with volatility in the first and third quarters. Since 1950, the indicator has predicted positive years in almost 84% of cases. Hirsch said, 'I feel encouraged by the market gains so far in January, with one day to go.' He also noted, 'It's bullish. But the gains in 2025 will be more difficult and less pronounced than in the last two years.' Hirsch is cautious about the first quarter, especially in February and March, as this period is 'a weak point in the 4-year presidential cycle.' Despite the recent cooling of the 'AI fever,' the broad participation and sector rotation are welcome. Stephen Suttmeier, a technical analyst at Bank of America Securities, said that if the S&P 500 closes above 5,882 on Friday, 'the January Barometer will generate a bullish signal for 2025 and the February-December period.' The index closed at 6,071 on Thursday.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[bitfinanzas.com](https://bitfinanzas.com/el-january-barometer-predice-ganancias-en-2025/)\n\n**CPI Report Could Exacerbate US Stock Market Sell-Off**\nAnalysts expect the S&P 500 to move by 1% on January 15, based on put and call option prices, according to Stuart Kaiser, head of US equity trading strategy at Citigroup. This is the largest implied move before a Consumer Price Index (CPI) release since the regional bank turmoil in March 2023. Analysts predict a 0.2% increase in core inflation for December, following a 0.3% increase in November. This would put the core rate at 3.3% year-over-year, above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. However, a strong US labor market and rising energy prices have raised concerns that actual values may be higher than expected. 'If inflation turns out hotter than expected, interest rates could rise further and put more pressure on the stock market,' warn analysts. Brent Kochuba, founder of options platform SpotGamma, comments, 'A cool CPI number could quickly bring the S&P 500 back above 5,900 [points].' He also notes, 'We see some large long-put positions under the surface. If the CPI is hot, the S&P 500's downward rate could rise, accompanied by a large VIX surge.' The increased volatility and higher put premiums have made broader hedging more attractive on the stock market, says Kochuba. The reaction to the CPI data at the options markets shows that investors are becoming more sensitive to inflation reports again. Interest rate anxiety is growing, with the Fed's plan for two rate cuts in 2025 being threatened by rising inflation data. Analysts warn that the Trump administration's planned measures, such as higher tariffs and labor market restrictions, could trigger additional inflationary shocks. 'The risk of rising inflation and interest rate hikes in summer 2025 is significant,' say experts. If inflation does not decline as expected, the Fed may be forced to consider further rate hikes, which would put more pressure on the stock market.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:42 AM\nSource:[wallstreet-online.de](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/18896025-groesste-bewegung-maerz-2023-inflationsbericht-ausverkauf-us-aktien-verstaerken)\n\n**US Stock Market Rises After Producer Price Index Comes in Lower Than Expected**\nThe US stock market indices rose on Tuesday after the Producer Price Index (PPI) came in lower than expected. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 196 points, or 0.5%, while the S&P 500 index increased by 0.5% and the Nasdaq composite index rose by 0.8%. Some large technology stocks, such as Tesla and Palantir, rose by more than 2%. The PPI, which measures the change in wholesale prices, rose by only 0.2% in December, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, which was lower than the expected 0.4% increase. The core PPI, which excludes food and energy, remained stable during the same month. Investors are now looking to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report due out on Wednesday for clues on the next move by the Federal Reserve on interest rates. Chris Briggs, chief investment officer at SWBC, said that the soft PPI reading on Tuesday 'is friendly to the stock market, as it helps to alleviate concerns that we are on the cusp of a rapid inflation spike.' He added: 'All eyes are now on the CPI report on Wednesday, as it will fuel the market's obsession with the Federal Reserve.' Briggs said: 'A strong inflation number adds to the idea of no rate cut in 2025, and maybe even a rate hike, while a weak inflation number may help to calm the market's concerns about the Fed.' The Fed's interest rate futures are indicating a near certainty that the Fed will keep rates unchanged at the end of its meeting later this month. Additionally, market expectations are pointing to a 79% chance that rates will remain within the current range of 4.25-4.5% during the Fed's meeting in March.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 06:05 PM\nSource:[banker.news](https://www.banker.news/90631)\n\n**Options Traders Flag Big S&P 500 Moves as Inflation Report Looms**\nOptions traders are preparing for significant market volatility tied to the upcoming US consumer price index report on Wednesday. According to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup's head of US equity trading strategy, the S&P 500 Index is expected to move 1% in either direction, which is the largest implied move ahead of a CPI print since the regional bank turmoil in March 2023. 'That's the largest implied move ahead of a CPI print since the regional bank turmoil in March 2023,' Kaiser said.

According to Stuart Kaiser, Citigroup Inc.'s head of US equity trading strategy, the S&P 500 Index is expected to move 1% in either direction on January 15, the largest implied move ahead of a CPI print since March 2023. This heightened focus on CPI is due to soaring bond yields and robust jobs data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 10:45 AM\nSource:[Bloomberg Business](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-14/traders-brace-for-s-p-500-s-busiest-cpi-day-since-march-2023)\n\n**US Energy Sector Sees Strong Rebound in 2025, But Analysts Remain Pessimistic**\nThe US energy sector has seen a strong rebound in the first seven trading days of 2025, with a gain of over 5%, making it the best-performing S&P 500 sector so far this year. The increase is attributed to the surge in natural gas prices due to the US winter and the Biden administration's full-scale sanctions on Russian oil exports, which have pushed oil prices above $80 per barrel. Additionally, the growing demand for electricity due to the development of AI data centers has boosted the stock prices of nuclear power companies, such as Constellation Energy and Vistra, with gains of 24.82% and 17.60% respectively. However, Wall Street analysts remain pessimistic about the long-term prospects of the energy sector. According to US Bank analysts, the OPEC+ decision to extend the voluntary production cut of 2.2 million barrels per day until March 2025 will limit the impact of oil price increases, making it unlikely for the energy sector to continue its upward trend. Morgan Stanley and Citi analysts also predict that Brent crude oil futures will decline to $70 per barrel in the first quarter of 2025, from the current price of $81 per barrel.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 04:38 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://finance.technews.tw/2025/01/14/energy-stocks-are-off-to-a-blockbuster-start-in-2025-after-back-to-back-years-of-underperformance/)\n\n**Is the Stock Market's Upswing Coming to an End?**\nDespite some analysts' concerns about a potential downturn, the majority of investors believe that the stock market will continue to rise until the end of 2025. According to forecasts, the Standard & Poor's 500 index is expected to rise by at least 10% in 2025, driven by investors' optimism about the incoming president's plans to liberalize the economy and cut taxes, which are expected to boost economic growth. While there are concerns about renewed inflation, investor sentiment remains largely positive. However, as the saying goes, 'what goes up must come down,' and it's always wise to heed warnings, even if they are in the minority.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 05, 2025 02:48 PM\nSource:[\u0631\u0624\u064a\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a](https://royanews.tv/news/340461)\n\n**Will the US Dollar Index Continue to Rise in 2025?**\nThe US dollar index has continued to rise, causing the S&P US Dollar Daily Return Index (00684R) to break through again, falling 0.8% or 0.13 yuan to 14.5 yuan on the third day, the lowest since its listing on March 14, 2017. Experts point out that the foreign exchange market in 2024 was highly volatile, mainly due to the major central banks outside of Japan officially entering the rate-cutting cycle, reversing the violent rate hikes of the past few years. Assets have undergone re-evaluation, and future investment thinking also needs to shift from tightening to easing. The US dollar index rose from around 101 in early 2024 to 106, then fell back to 100 in September, narrowly avoiding a major decline. However, after the Fed's September meeting, the dollar index rebounded and rose to 108 by the end of the year, with a year-over-year gain of over 7%. Looking ahead, experts believe that with the current market valuation, the Fed is likely to have a 2-point rate cut this year, while the ECB is expected to have a 4-5 point rate cut. The price has already reflected this in the dollar index. However, if there is a change in the balance of power, the dollar index may change its valuation. Despite the US economy's 2025 outlook being better than the eurozone's turbulent political situation, the dollar index is expected to maintain its 2024 upward momentum, driven by economic momentum. However, it is necessary to pay attention to the short-term large gains, which may lead to a correction and consolidation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/123006/8467475)\n\n**US 'Two Houses' Suddenly Surge Over 30%, Trump's Favor?**\nThe US housing market has seen a sudden surge in two major mortgage-backed securities companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with Fannie Mae rising over 36% and Freddie Mac over 33%. Billionaire Bill Ackman believes that these companies may be deregulated by the Trump administration and potentially go public in 2026. Ackman predicts that the stocks have 'huge asymmetric upside potential' as the economy recovers and housing demand increases. He advises investors to seize the opportunity and closely monitor the market trend to make informed investment decisions. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs predicts that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in March 2025, with a 25-basis-point cut, followed by another 25-basis-point cut in June and September, with a terminal rate of 3.5% to 3.75%. Kenny Polcari, a strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC, warns that this week is another short trading week with low volume and potential increased volatility, advising against making major investment decisions. On the other hand, Citi encourages investors to capture the potential market correction in early 2025, citing that the valuation and implicit growth expectations make the market look high. The bank highlights that the S&P 500 index is expected to see double-digit profit growth, and the outlook for S&P 500 constituents in a 'no-cycle' macro environment is optimistic. Despite market volatility, Citi remains confident, citing efficiency gains and long-term tailwinds. The bank favors healthcare, communication, energy, and finance, as well as essential and non-essential consumer goods, industrial, and materials industries.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 31, 2024 01:22 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8fks4Vh7qjx)\n\n**Stock Market Soars! Can It Go Higher?**\nThe S&P 500 is on track to achieve consecutive annual gains exceeding 20% for the first time since the late '90s, with analysts predicting a bullish 2025. The index has risen about 24% this year, mirroring its impressive 2023 performance. Wall Street experts largely agree that the upward trend will continue, with a 10% increase in the S&P 500 projected for 2025. Even conservative analysts like those from Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan anticipate growth, with Oppenheimer's chief strategist remaining the most optimistic, predicting nearly 20% gains in the coming year. The robust economy and supportive government policies are fueling the record-breaking rally, with a significant influx of $500 billion invested in U.S. stocks in 2024.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[elblog.pl](https://elblog.pl/2024/12/31/stock-market-soars-can-it-go-higher/)\n\n**S&P 500 Index Expected to Rise 10% in 2025, but Valuation Concerns Remain**\nWall Street analysts predict that the S&P 500 index will continue to rise steadily in 2025, with a target of around 6,679 points, a 10% increase from the current level. This forecast is in line with the index's historical average annual return of 10.23% since its inception in 1957. However, there are varying predictions from different financial institutions, with Goldman Sachs being the most conservative at 6,500 points, implying a 9% price appreciation and dividend yield, while Deutsche Bank and Yardeni Research are more optimistic with a target of 7,000 points, expecting a 17% increase. Many institutions remind investors to be aware of the potential for large market fluctuations. The strong performance of the S&P 500 index in 2024, with a gain of over 15% and a second consecutive year of over 20% increase, is supported by several key factors, including expected 11% earnings growth in 2025 and 7% in 2026, as well as 5% revenue growth, in line with nominal GDP. Economists also predict a 2.5% actual GDP growth and a 2.4% inflation rate, creating a favorable environment for market expansion. However, analysts expect the market to shift from being dominated by large tech stocks to a more diversified market, driven by improved financial conditions and potential regulatory easing, which may lead to increased merger and acquisition activity, providing additional support for stock prices. Additionally, the market is expected to benefit from strong cyclical growth and higher risk tolerance, particularly with the unemployment rate remaining around 4%. Nevertheless, valuation concerns remain, with the S&P 500 index's price-to-earnings ratio having grown 25% over the past two years to 21.7 times, highlighting the importance of sustained earnings growth to maintain market appreciation. Furthermore, the potential impact of the new government's trade policies, including possible targeted tariffs on goods from other regions, may also affect the market's performance in 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 11:34 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/5822404)\n\n**Market Outlook: Long-term Rates Could Break Before 2025**\nThis week is expected to be relatively calm in the markets. The most relevant publication will be the ISM manufacturing PMI report on Friday, January 3. At the beginning of the week, some data on the real estate sector will be published, while the continuous unemployment benefit requests on January 2 will capture attention. Last week, the requests reached 1.91 million, although they are usually revised downward. An unexpected increase in these requests could indicate a possible slowdown in the labor market, although the overall data still suggests strength. The ISM report this week, with a forecast of 48.2 (slightly lower than 48.4), will be one of the few key indicators available. The S&P 500 index experienced a late recovery, adding 30-40 points in the last 15 minutes, driven by a $2 billion buy imbalance. Despite this, market breadth was weak: only 48 stocks advanced, while 452 declined and three remained unchanged. The strong decline of the Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon stocks contributed to the losses. The Bloomberg 500 index reflected this weakness, highlighting the challenging journey for equities. The BTIC S&P 500 futures contract for March 2025 has fallen sharply, from a high of 179.5 to 71 at the close of Friday. Historically, these contracts have been traded in narrower ranges, indicating that this year's movement is more pronounced. This could suggest a year-end de-leveraging or lower demand for margin and leverage. If the trend continues, it could reflect a broader market dynamic, such as a tightening of liquidity or adjustments to intermediaries' balance sheets. We will have more information when the FINRA data on margins is published in mid-January. The 30-year US Treasury bond yield reached its highest level since November 2023, closing at 4.82%. Unlike late 2023, when yields were falling, they are now rising and could surpass 5% again. The yield curve is steepening rapidly, especially in the differentials between 30-year and 3-month bonds, as well as between 10-year and 3-month bonds. This downward-sloping inclination, where long-term yields rise faster than short-term yields, can affect equities. Equities have always struggled during periods of yield curve steepening, especially when long-term interest rates are the ones increasing the most. The futures contracts, such as the 3-month Treasury bill against the 18-month futures contract, suggest that rates could rise by 20 points in the next 18 months. Similarly, the futures contracts for 12 months imply a 50% probability of a rate hike in the next year. This could explain the lower demand for leverage, as it is unlikely that the costs of funding will decrease. Making a parallel with the 1960s, the increase in rates and the steepening of the yield curve contributed to negative stock risk premiums and significant challenges for the market during that time. If these trends persist, we could see a similar dynamic in the coming months. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 09:03 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/analysis/la-bolsa-esta-semana-los-tipos-a-largo-plazo-podrian-romper-antes-de-2025-200474429)\n\n",
