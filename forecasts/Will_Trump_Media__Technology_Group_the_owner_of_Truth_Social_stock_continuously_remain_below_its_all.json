The loss is accompanied by a 12% decrease in annual revenue, which now stands at $3.6 million, attributed to an undisclosed advertising partner. Unlike Meta and other social media companies, Trump Media's management stated in the report that they do not believe in using traditional metrics such as active users or average revenue per user. This 'could potentially divert attention from the strategic evaluation of the company's progress and growth', according to the report. The company's stock price fell by around 1% in extended trading on Friday after the operator of Truth Social published its results for 2024. Trump Media has been criticized for its lack of transparency in its financial reporting, and its decision not to hold a conference call to discuss the results. The company has also been accused of using its platform to promote its own financial interests, including the launch of a new fintech service called Truth.Fi, which will offer cryptocurrency and ETF investments. Trump Media has placed $250 million (approximately one-third of its liquid assets) under the supervision of Charles Schwab Corp. to be invested in funds, bitcoin, and other financial vehicles. The company's financial situation has raised concerns about its viability and ability to compete with larger social media companies like Meta and X (formerly Twitter).\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 12:18 PM\nSource:[developpez.com](https://web.developpez.com/actu/369208/Trump-Media-affiche-une-perte-colossale-de-plus-de-400-millions-de-dollars-en-2024-et-12-pourcent-de-revenus-en-moins-soit-3-6-millions-de-dollars-L-entreprise-refuse-de-communiquer-les-metriques-traditionnelles/)\n\n**Trump Media & Technology Group Reports Significant Losses in 2024**\nTrump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) reported a net loss of $400.86 million in 2024, a significant increase from the previous year's net loss of $58.19 million.
