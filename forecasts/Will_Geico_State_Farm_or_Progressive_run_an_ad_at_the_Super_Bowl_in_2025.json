This move reflects a larger trend of declining ad spend from the biggest insurers in the U.S. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence data, Progressive's ad spend decreased by 30% to $1.22 billion, Geico's by 34% to $838.2 million, and Allstate's by 31% to $651.3 million. State Farm's ad budget was relatively flat, dipping just 2% to $992 million. The company stated that it will not have a presence in or around the game itself, and that it did not have any other activations planned for this year's game. State Farm's decision to reduce coverage in California and not accept new applications for business and personal lines of property and casualty insurance since July 2024 has been attributed to the impacts of inflation, catastrophe exposure, and limitations of working within decades-old insurance regulations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[sportico.com](https://www.sportico.com/business/sponsorship/2025/state-farm-super-bowl-reduced-insurance-spend-1234825710/)\n\n**From Martha Stewart To Doja Cat -- These Super Bowl Commercials Will Have The Biggest Stars**\nSeveral big brands, including Coffee Mate, Rocket Mortgage, Booking.com, Mountain Dew, GoDaddy, and Doritos, will feature celebrity spokespeople in their Super Bowl LIX commercials.

The company has been criticized for pausing the sale of insurance policies for new homes in California and announcing a policy to non-renew 30,000 properties in the state. According to a State Farm spokesperson, 'State Farm, State Farm agents, and our employees are all focused on helping customers impacted by the Southern California wildfires in the midst of this tragedy.' The company has reported that its customer contact is at 90% and has received over 7,400 home and auto claims, with tens of millions of dollars being returned to customers.

A spokesperson confirmed that the insurance giant has no plans to advertise during the Big Game. This decision comes after Progressive aired its first Super Bowl ad in 2024, starring Kid 'n Play, which initially aired in 2023 as part of the 'What Really Happened Replay' campaign. The ad was created by VML and featured the iconic '90s hip-hop duo arguing over what kind of party they had originally agreed to have for the Big Game. Progressive had made a contingency plan to air the ad if the game went into overtime, which would have cost $5 million for a 30-second spot on Fox. However, the game ended at its regularly scheduled time, and the ad did not air. This is not the first time Progressive has skipped the Super Bowl, as it also did in 2020, but it made up for it by putting a halftime show in its ad that aired around the game.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 03:54 PM\nSource:[Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/progressive-insurance-will-not-return-to-super-bowl-after-last-years-overtime-ad/)\n\n**State Farm pulls advertising for Super Bowl to focus helping California recover from wildfires**\nState Farm Insurance has decided to pull its advertising during the Super Bowl to focus on helping the people of Los Angeles recover from devastating wildfires.
