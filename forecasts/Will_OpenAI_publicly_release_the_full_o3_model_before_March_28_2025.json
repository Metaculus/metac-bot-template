Described as a successor to o1 and skipping over o2, purportedly due to [<u>Telefonica\u2019s O2</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O2_\\(UK\\)), OpenAI [<u>described</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-announces-o3-models-175657596.html) o3 as a significant breakthrough in AI reasoning. The model was reported to have significantly outperformed any previous AI system [<u>on coding and research-level math</u>](https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1870172996650053653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1870172996650053653%7Ctwgr%5E16fa4771724238be9b30de71968a334c68bca7af%7Ctwcon%5Es1_\\&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2024%2F12%2F20%2Fopenai-announces-new-o3-model%2F), and also [<u>exceeded previous performance</u>](https://arcprize.org/blog/oai-o3-pub-breakthrough) on the [<u>Abstract and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence</u>](https://arcprize.org/arc) (ARC-AGI) challenge by far, even reaching approximately human level. According to ARC-AGI:\n\n> Despite the significant cost per task, these numbers aren't just the result of applying brute force compute to the benchmark. OpenAI's new o3 model represents a significant leap forward in AI's ability to adapt to novel tasks. This is not merely incremental improvement, but a genuine breakthrough, marking a qualitative shift in AI capabilities compared to the prior limitations of LLMs. o3 is a system capable of adapting to tasks it has never encountered before, arguably approaching human-level performance in the ARC-AGI domain.\n> \u00a0\n> Of course, such generality comes at a steep cost, and wouldn't quite be economical yet: you could pay a human to solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly \\$5 per task (we know, we did that), while consuming mere cents in energy. Meanwhile o3 requires \\$17-20 per task in the low-compute mode. But cost-performance will likely improve quite dramatically over the next few months and years, so you should plan for these capabilities to become competitive with human work within a fairly short timeline.\n\nOpenAI also announced applicants could [<u>apply</u>](https://openai.com/index/early-access-for-safety-testing/) to help safety test forthcoming advanced models. In the announcement video, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman [<u>said</u>](https://www.youtube.com/live/SKBG1sqdyIU?si=_93eeXULrkrt8K_o\\&t=1293):\n\n> We plan to launch o3-mini around the end of January, and full o3 shortly after that, but . . . the more people can help us safety test the more we can make sure we hit that.",

Stated intentions to continue developing and improving the o3 model will **not** on their own result in the model being considered to not yet be the full version of o3.\n  * Names or descriptions that suggest a variant form of a \u201cfull\u201d version will be sufficient to resolve the question as **Yes**. For example, o3-pro would be sufficient, while different versions with low and high compute times would also count, for example \u201co3-low\u201d or \u201co3-high\u201d, so long as Metaculus assesses that their descriptions are compatible with being a variant of o3 full.\n* It is immaterial if o3 is released with limited or restricted reasoning or compute times. For example, if o3 is released in a manner that satisfies these criteria but is only available in \u201clow\u201d compute mode or has similar restrictions, the question will still resolve as **Yes**.\n* In the event OpenAI renames o3 to be something other than o3, this question will still resolve as **Yes** if OpenAI states that the model is the one formerly announced as o3 and all other criteria have been met.\n* Metaculus will defer to statements made by OpenAI.

Availability in other countries is not required.\n  * It must not be subject to an invite-only waitlist, for example invite-only betas or testing periods are not sufficient.\u00a0\n  * In the event of a gradual or phased rollout, or in the event access and signups are disabled due to high demand, the question will resolve as **Yes** if at least two Metaculus admins are able to access o3, on separate accounts, as described in these criteria before the date in question. Metaculus admins will not make excessive effort to check for access or to try to get access (aside from completing any signup or subscription steps needed to access o3), and will simply check periodically whether they can access o3.\n  * Rate limits or usage restrictions on the number of messages allowed are immaterial, so long as at least one message and response can be had.\n* Release of o3 via API without being released as a web interface is not sufficient.",

OpenAI also showcased o3-mini, a new model that uses the company's Adaptive Thinking Time API to provide three different reasoning modes. o3-mini is expected to be released in late January 2025, with o3 to follow shortly after.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 21, 2024 02:09 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/openais-next-generation-o3-model-will-arrive-early-next-year-020033002.html)\n\n**OpenAI Announces New Model o3 with Significant Improvements**\nOpenAI announced a new model, o3, which is set to be released in early 2024. The model is currently not available for public use, but will be made available to researchers for testing its security. The company also announced o3-mini, which is expected to be released in late January, and the full version of o3 will be released shortly after. The main feature of o3 is its significant improvement over its predecessor, o1. On the American math exam AIME, o3 achieved a 96.7% accuracy rate, compared to o1's 83.3%. This means that o3 typically makes only one mistake. The model performed well on standard tests, so the company had to create more complex tests, such as ARC-AGI, which evaluates the ability of AI to learn intuitively. According to the creators of the test, passing ARC-AGI would be a 'significant milestone on the path to artificial general intelligence.' o3 achieved a 75.7% score on ARC-AGI with low computational resources, and 87.5% with additional resources. OpenAI also demonstrated o3-mini with three reasoning modes (low, medium, and high) based on the recently announced Adaptive Thinking Time API. This allows users to regulate the time 'for thinking' before the model provides an answer. o3-mini can achieve the results of the current model o1 with significantly lower computational costs and will be available to users before the full version of o3.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 21, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[itoboz.com](https://itoboz.com/games/openai-anonsirovala-model-novogo-pokoleniya-o3-s-relizom-v-nachale-goda/)\n\n**OpenAI Develops New AI Model 'o3' with Improved Math and Code Generation Capabilities**\nOpenAI has announced the development of its new AI model, 'o3', which is expected to be released in January 2025.

The new model is designed to think before responding and can perform tasks such as reasoning and planning. According to OpenAI, 'o3' is more reliable than 'o1' in fields such as physics, science, and mathematics. In some cases, 'o3' is even comparable to general-purpose AI (AGI). The model can adjust its reasoning time, allowing users to set the operation time to 'low', 'medium', or 'high', with longer operation times resulting in better performance. OpenAI claims that 'o3' outperforms other models in benchmarks, including a 22.8% improvement in the SWE-Bench Verified benchmark and a score of 2727 on the Codeforces benchmark, surpassing the top 99.2% of engineers. The company plans to release 'o3' in January 2025, with a mini version 'o3 mini' to be released first. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, said, 'We plan to release 'o3 mini' in late January and 'o3' soon after.' Some researchers will receive a preview of the model starting today. The release of 'o3' is expected to accelerate the competition with Google's 'Jenny 2.0' and Meta's 'Llama 4'.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 10:51 PM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20241221012800091)\n\n**OpenAI Unveils o3 and o3-mini: The Next Generation of Artificial Reasoning Models**\nOpenAI has announced the development of its new artificial intelligence models, o3 and o3-mini, marking a significant advancement in the pursuit of creating more intelligent and capable AI systems. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, o3-mini is set to be released at the end of January 2025, followed by the full version of o3. These new models represent a significant evolution over their predecessors, particularly in their ability for 'simulated reasoning'. The o3 model has set new records in various benchmarks, including a 'private thought chain' system that allows AI to pause and examine its internal dialogue before responding, simulating human-like reasoning more accurately. OpenAI has initiated a request process for external researchers to test the o3 models before their public release, with applications open until January 10, prioritizing security and thorough evaluation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 09:14 PM\nSource:[RPP noticias](https://rpp.pe/tecnologia/innovaciones/openai-lanza-o3-y-o3-mini-la-proxima-generacion-de-modelos-de-razonamiento-artificial-noticia-1605783)\n\n**OpenAI Announces Next-Generation 'Reasoning' Models o3 and o3-mini**\nOpenAI announced the next generation of 'reasoning' models, o3 and o3-mini, which are designed to think before responding to user queries. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, the previous model, o1, was named with a deliberate omission of a digit 'out of respect for Telefonica (O2 brand) and the tradition of coming up with bad names.' The o3 model is trained to reason before responding, which results in a delay, but it provides a chain of reasoning and the final answer it considers most accurate. Users can adjust the thinking time, and the model's performance improves with more time. In the ARC-AGI test, o3 achieved a 87.5% result, which is considered 'human-level' at 85%. However, TechCrunch notes that these results should be taken with skepticism and await external testing. The models are not yet available to the public, but will be available for public safety tests. Altman announced that o3-mini will be released by the end of January 2025, followed by o3. OpenAI previously released a preview of o1 in September 2024, and a full version in early December, along with a ChatGPT Pro subscription with access to an 'exclusive' version.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 06:47 PM\nSource:[vc.ru](https://vc.ru/chatgpt/1720592-openai-o3)\n\n**OpenAI's New Model o3: A Leap Towards AGI**\nOpenAI has announced o3, a new 'frontier model' that can reason and solve complex puzzles with unprecedented performance for a generative AI. o3 will be available in ChatGPT in 2025 after security tests. The model is designed to excel in tasks such as code and mathematical problems, and is aimed at scientists rather than general users. According to OpenAI, o3 has broken several records in internal tests and is getting closer to human-like reasoning. o3 will enter a 'Public Safety Testing' phase today, allowing researchers and registered users to test it. OpenAI also announced o3-mini, a smaller version of the model, which will be available in three variants: low, medium, and high. The low version will be as fast as GPT-4o, while the high version will be 46 times slower.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 06:37 PM\nSource:[numerama.com](https://www.numerama.com/tech/1870856-le-futur-modele-de-chatgpt-sappelle-o3-voici-ses-nouveautes.html)\n\n",
