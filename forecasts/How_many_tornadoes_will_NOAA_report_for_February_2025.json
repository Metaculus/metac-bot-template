The National Weather Service issued ice storm warnings for parts of West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. Up to a quarter inch of ice was possible in western Maryland, West Virginia, and central and southern Pennsylvania, while up to 6 inches of snow was expected in higher elevations. AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter explained that a light glaze of ice can create treacherous driving conditions and weigh down trees and power lines, increasing the risk of power outages. The same areas could face power outages as the ice and freezing rain will be followed by cold, gusty winds. Additionally, tornado warnings were issued for parts of Kentucky, and heavy rains caused flooding in Kentucky and West Virginia. Residents in several states reported seeing 'thunder ice' \u2014 or freezing rain accompanied by flashes of lightning. This is just the start of what forecasters say could be a stormy February, with a second winter storm possible on Saturday and a third storm possible early next week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 07:20 PM\nSource:[news.yahoo.com](https://news.yahoo.com/news/storm-brings-snow-sleet-and-freezing-rain-to-mid-atlantic-and-northeast-more-than-100-million-under-winter-storm-alerts-185448916.html)\n\n**Over 1.4 million receive tornado alerts in Kentucky**\nOver 1.4 million Kentucky residents have received tornado alerts for an imminent storm set to hit the state on Thursday.

According to the National Weather Service, an average of 800 tornadoes are reported nationwide every year, with the peak season for Florida and surrounding southern states being March through May. Bay County officials emphasize the importance of staying connected and making a plan to stay prepared. 'Being able to receive alerts is the primary of importance. And then the second thing is making sure you have a plan and you know what you\u2019re going to do to react to the issuance of a tornado watch or a tornado warning,' said Bay County manager Bob Majka. A tornado watch is when people should be ready and prepared, while a tornado warning is when they should take action and seek shelter. In 2024, Florida saw over 100 tornadoes, with 6 hitting the Panhandle in January. Officials stress that having a disaster plan is crucial, which includes knowing the best place to seek shelter and checking home insurance coverage. 'We always encourage people, make sure you understand what your insurance policy covers, understand, you know, what those benefits are,' said Majka.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:35 AM\nSource:[mypanhandle.com](https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/severe-weather-awareness-week-day-3-what-you-need-to-know-about-tornadoes/)\n\n**30 Tornadoes in a Year: Unusual Activity in 2024**\nAccording to the French tornado and violent storm observatory, Keraunos, the year 2024 saw a 'higher than normal' tornado activity, with 30 tornadoes recorded in a year, spread over 22 days. This is similar to the activity seen in 2023, but not as high as the record of 50 tornadoes in 2014. Keraunos notes that the year 2024 was marked by a significant tornado, an EF2, which occurred in Carlepont, Oise on June 18, 2024. The tornado activity was unusual, with 'usual' tornadoes in the northwest and more surprising ones in the southwest and center-east. 'The year 2024 has presented an above-normal tornado activity, marked by frequent tornadoes in the spring and autumn', said Keraunos.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 03:20 PM\nSource:[Futura](https://www.futura-sciences.com/planete/breves/meteorologie-30-tornades-an-taux-superieur-normale-voici-regions-plus-frappees-france-10410/)\n\n**Being a Louisiana weather forecaster isn't easy. But 2025 snowstorm offered a rare bit of joy.**\nMike Efferson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service office in Slidell, Louisiana, has had to deal with many severe weather events in his 17-year career. However, the 2025 snowstorm that brought historic amounts of snow and record cold temperatures to south Louisiana was a rare and magical experience for him and his family. Efferson's daughters, 7-year-old Mariana and 4-year-old Melise, had never seen snow before, and the family enjoyed a fun-filled day playing in the snow, making snow angels, and having a snowball fight. Efferson, who has worked through many devastating weather events, including hurricanes and tornado outbreaks, said that this event was a welcome change from the usual high-pressure situations he faces. 'It was really exciting and it was really hard to believe,' Efferson said. 'All the pictures and videos were of people smiling and having fun.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[NOLA](https://www.nola.com/news/weather/forecaster-louisiana-snowstorm/article_71d60d88-de70-11ef-9282-8f23fd281362.html)\n\n**Entries for Poster Contest accepted through Friday**\nEntries for the 2025 Nebraska Severe Weather Awareness Poster Contest are accepted through Friday, February 7th.

The 27-day forecast of geomagnetic indices predicts the most intense magnetic storms on the following dates: February 20 - a powerful storm from weak to moderate, and February 27-28 - a moderate magnetic storm, Kp 4. The forecasts of magnetic storms can change depending on solar activity. It is recommended to regularly check updates on official websites and follow warnings from scientists. Magnetic storms occur due to coronal mass ejections on the Sun, which reach the Earth and interact with its magnetic field. Many people feel only powerful magnetic storms, while moderate ones are mostly experienced by those who are more sensitive to weather changes. Magnetic storms with high power levels can cause disruptions in the operation of communication devices - radio and mobile communication, GPRS, satellites. Magnetic storms can also affect people's well-being, especially those who are sensitive to changes in the geomagnetic environment. Possible symptoms include: headaches, fatigue, insomnia, and changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and other indicators related to the cardiovascular system. To minimize the negative impact of magnetic storms on health, experts recommend: limiting physical and psycho-emotional loads, avoiding intense training and heavy physical work, avoiding stressful situations, practicing relaxation techniques, maintaining a healthy sleep schedule, following a balanced diet, taking medications as needed, and staying hydrated. Regularly spending time outdoors and ventilating living spaces can also help.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 05:11 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/styler/magnitni-buri-usi-nespriyatlivi-dati-prognoz-1738274663.html)\n\n**Severe Thunderstorm Alert Issued for 10 US States**\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a severe thunderstorm alert for over 17 million people in the United States, warning of heavy rain, flooding, and possible tornadoes in 10 states. According to the NWS, the storm system will move through the central and southern US starting on Friday, January 31, causing strong winds and torrential rains. The affected states are Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The NWS warned, 'Flooding of small creeks and streams, urban areas, highways, streets and underpasses as well as other poor drainage and low-lying areas is ongoing or may begin vary soon across portions of...'. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has also issued a tornado watch for the eastern part of Texas, southeastern Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, where heavy rain and flooding are also expected. The storm system is expected to dissipate by Saturday morning, February 1, when it will move out to sea along the eastern coast of the US. 'According to NOAA, approximately 4.45 inches of rain is expected in the affected areas.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 09:57 PM\nSource:[as.com](https://us.as.com/actualidad/alerta-por-tormentas-electricas-severas-estados-afectados-con-inundaciones-y-riesgo-de-tornados-n/)\n\n**February Tornadoes Usually In South, Except In 2024**\nFebruary tornadoes are typically rare in the US, with an average of 42 tornadoes per year since 2004. However, in 2024, 45 tornadoes were confirmed, mostly in the Midwest, which is unusual. Wisconsin even experienced its first February tornado in records dating back to before statehood. Large February outbreaks have happened before, including the 2008 Super Tuesday outbreak that had 86 confirmed tornadoes and the 1971 outbreak that claimed 121 lives. Winter tornadoes are particularly dangerous due to rapid storm movement, rain-wrapped tornadoes, and straight-line wind damage. It's essential to take shelter immediately when receiving a warning, regardless of the time of day.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 10:53 PM\nSource:[The Weather Channel](https://weather.com/storms/tornado/news/2025-01-27-february-tornado-threat-average-2024-oddities)\n\n**February Tornado Threat Is Usually Highest In The South, Except In 2024**\nFebruary is typically one of the least active months for tornadoes in the US, averaging only about 42 tornadoes per year since 2004. However, in 2024, the situation was unusual, with 45 tornadoes confirmed in the US, mostly in the Midwest. Wisconsin experienced its first February tornado in records dating back to before statehood, and a large outbreak occurred on February 27-28, with 23 tornadoes touching down in northern Illinois, Lower Michigan, Ohio, and New York state. According to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center, the majority of tornadoes in February 2024 were in the Midwest, not in the South, which is typically the most affected region. As weather historian Christopher Burt noted, 'The Enigma Outbreak' of 1884, which spawned a swarm of stronger tornadoes across eight states in the Southeast, remains one of the deadliest February tornado outbreaks in recent times. 'The Enigma Outbreak' was dubbed 'The Enigma Outbreak' because the exact number of tornadoes and deaths is unknown. 'The Enigma Outbreak' occurred on February 19-20, 1884, and at least 182 deaths were documented. As we've discussed before, several factors make winter severe weather outbreaks dangerous, including storms moving rapidly, tornadoes being rain-wrapped, straight-line wind damage, and severe weather happening any hour of the day.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 09:54 PM\nSource:[beastwatchnews.com](https://beastwatchnews.com/february-tornado-threat-is-usually-highest-in-the-south-except-in-2024/)\n\n**February will be off to a mild start**\nMiddle Tennessee and Southern Kentucky have experienced extremely cold temperatures in the first month of 2025, with 20 out of the first 25 days being colder-than-normal in Nashville. However, the Climate Prediction Center's 6 to 10 day temperature outlook shows a high chance for warmer-than-normal temperatures for the first week of February, with temperatures potentially reaching near 70\u00b0. The Climate Prediction Center also agrees that temperatures will be above average from Feb. 3-9. While warmer temperatures increase the risk of severe thunderstorms and tornadoes, there is no significant severe weather threat within the next week. It's essential to stay informed and have a tornado safety plan in place, especially during the most active time of year for tornadoes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 09:13 PM\nSource:[wkrn.com](https://www.wkrn.com/weather-headlines/feb-2025-mild-start/)\n\n**Old Farmer's Almanac forecasts 'Thunder and Zing' spring for Alabama: Tornado season is nearly here**\nThe Old Farmer's Almanac has forecasted a 'Thunder and Zing Spring' for the United States, with the Southeast region, including Alabama, expected to be warm, wet, and thundery. The Almanac predicts that spring will be slow to arrive for many areas, with cold weather lingering in the Midwest, Great Lakes, New England, and Northeast. In Alabama, the forecast for Easter (April 20, 2025) is 'pleasant', but Memorial Day weekend (May 24-27, 2025) could bring heavy rain.

The National Weather Service expects the final total to be over 1,700, making it the second worst year on record, after 2004. The year saw a particularly active jet stream, the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to neutral conditions, and an exceptionally warm Gulf of Mexico, contributing to the rough weather. At least 50 people died, and several states broke their previous records for tornadoes, including Oklahoma, which had its worst year on record with 152 confirmed twisters. The increasing trend in the South and Southeast is a concern, with the 65 preliminary tornado reports across the South on Dec. 28 making it the third busiest day this year. 'We just never really got a break,' said Victor Gensini, an associate professor of meteorology and severe weather at Northern Illinois University. 'This (2024) will be the highest year for insured losses for severe convective storms \u2013 including hail, wind and tornadoes \u2013 by a large margin,' Gensini said. 'The Gulf of Mexico played a particular role in the cooler months, he said.

In January, two powerful winter storm systems dropped over 25 inches of snow in the region, with 28.4 inches of snow falling in Moline between Dec. 1, 2023, and Jan. 13, 2024. A rare late February tornado touched down in Annawan, destroying a shop and flipping over a semi on Interstate 80. The Midwest experienced a record-breaking year for tornadoes, with Iowa breaking its 20-year record for most tornadoes in a year. The region also saw damaging winds, including a derecho that produced 16 tornadoes and winds up to 100 mph. Summer flooding along the Mississippi River caused several road closures, temporary business closures, and business relocations. 'It's been known for centuries that the sun goes through various cycles,' said a meteorologist. 'We are currently in Cycle 25, which began in 2020 and will continue through 2031.' The northern lights made a dramatic appearance in the Quad Cities region twice this year, first with a severe geomagnetic storm in May and most recently in early October.
