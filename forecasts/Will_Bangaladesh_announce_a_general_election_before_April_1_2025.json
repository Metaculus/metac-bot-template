The commission will analyze the project of law that incorporates the members of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) to the Law 044 for the judgment of high authorities of the State. Guachalla explained that the members of the TSE have requested to be incorporated due to the 2019 conflicts that led to their arrest without a proper process. The commission will also address the project of law to modify the Law 1096 of Political Organizations to guarantee the preclusion of the decisions of the TSE and avoid obstacles to the elections scheduled for August. Guachalla stated that the principle of preclusion has been debated, as they do not want the elections to be delayed like the judicial elections, which took over a year and resulted in a mandate extension. Another project of law aims to establish the obligation of debate for all presidential candidates. Guachalla emphasized that many parties refuse to participate in debates, and this should be mandatory because citizens have the right to know the proposals of each party and citizen group before voting.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 04:15 PM\nSource:[eju.tv](https://eju.tv/2025/02/diputada-guachalla-camara-de-diputados-comision-de-constitucion-prioriza-proyectos-de-ley-para-garantizar-elecciones-generales-de-2025/)\n\n**Jamaat-e-Islami Wants Interim Government to Carry Out Reforms Before Elections**\nJamaat-e-Islami Secretary General Mia Golam Parwar stated that his party wants to give the interim government more time to hold a free, fair, and neutral election after necessary reforms.
