The company's latest AI model, DeepSeek R1, has gained significant traction, competing with the best American companies in the field, despite using a fraction of the necessary resources. This achievement has caused a stir in the stock market, with Nvidia's shares dropping 17%, resulting in a $600 billion loss in market value. This is a significant blow to the US efforts to restrict the export of AI-specialized devices to China. DeepSeek was trained using Nvidia H800 chips, a simplified version of the H100 chips subject to export restrictions, but the company has achieved excellent results using these less powerful chips. DeepSeek's path has not been without obstacles, having faced a DDoS attack and imposing restrictions on registration, making the app available only to Chinese phone users.

When asked about the change in download rankings, DeepSeek and ChatGPT provided their respective perspectives. DeepSeek analyzed the situation from multiple angles, stating that as a new AI application, it may have gained users quickly through free or discounted strategies, particularly by differentiating itself from ChatGPT's free version with limitations. Meanwhile, ChatGPT, as an industry benchmark, attracts heavy AI users, while lightweight and vertical applications are starting to harvest niche markets, reflecting the maturity of the market. DeepSeek noted that the US market has a high appetite for new and trendy applications, and a surge in downloads can trigger the App Store's recommendation mechanism, forming a positive feedback loop. However, it is essential to observe the 30-day active retention rate to avoid the 'flash-in-the-pan' phenomenon. Additionally, the current free strategy's ability to generate revenue through API calls, value-added services, or B2B partnerships will determine the sustainability of the operation. In contrast, ChatGPT's response was more concise: DeepSeek's ability to surpass ChatGPT in a short time may be due to its unique advantages or meeting users' specific needs, such as more efficient search, deeper information extraction, or a more user-friendly interface and functionality. However, ChatGPT also emphasized that it has a strong brand effect and user base in the AI field, and the ranking change may be temporary, but it indicates the intense competition in the market and the vast innovation space for AI applications. If DeepSeek can bring some breakthrough experiences, it may have a lasting impact on the market landscape.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 01:36 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_2115566404_7e18fb4404001iyc2.html)\n\n**ChatGPT Responds to Being Surpassed by DeepSeek: Ranking May Be Temporary**\nDeepSeek, a new AI application, has surpassed ChatGPT in the Apple US free app download rankings, sparking market excitement.

However, the model has been criticized for not being able to respond to historical events that contradict the country's political view, such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. DeepSeek has also surpassed ChatGPT in AppStore downloads and is one of the most highly-rated apps. The model's lower cost and potential for being more powerful have contributed to its success, but analysts have raised concerns about the total development costs, which may be higher than the reported $5.58 million.
