The ad, created by Grey New York, features the brand's mascot, Angel, offering the 'potty-tunity' from the Angel Soft brand. According to Laura Knebusch, Senior Vice President, CPG Marketing & Consumer Experience at Georgia Pacific, the ad is designed to provide the ultimate potty-tunity during the Big Game when viewers are engaged with every second. The brand conducted a survey of over 2000 U.S. consumers, which found that 92% of adults have held off on going to the bathroom so they don't have to miss out on something exciting or important, and 1 in 3 people have actually missed out on a major sports moment because they were in the bathroom. Knebusch states, 'Our campaign and commercial approach is built on an insight that's more relevant today than it's ever been. Events are getting longer, our lives are busier, and our bladders are staying the same size. People shouldn't have to trade-off between missing a moment that matters or using the bathroom.' The ad will air after the second quarter just before halftime and will feature Angel pointing out the 'potty-tunity.' The brand will also be activating across X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok with the Angel character taking over their owned channels.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 02:03 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/charlesrtaylor/2025/01/28/super-bowl-ads-2025-angel-soft--encourages-taking-a-bathroom-break/)\n\n**AI Agents Break Out: OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic Lead the Charge**\nThe year 2025 is expected to be the year of AI agents, with OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic leading the charge.

He said that 2025 will be a crucial period for the development of AI technology in the tourism industry. While the prevailing discourse in the sector suggests that AI tools will democratize the distribution of tourism, allowing providers to connect directly with consumers, the reality is more complex. The idealistic narrative imagines a future where AI agents eliminate intermediaries, simplifying travel planning and empowering providers. However, a deeper analysis suggests that online travel agencies (OTAs) will not only survive this transition but may even emerge stronger. The development of AI is led by technology giants like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple, as well as emerging actors like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity. These companies are investing billions of dollars in an attempt to dominate the AI market. The expert notes that the key factor that unites these actors is their dependence on advertising revenue. The development and maintenance of AI models require constant flows of capital, and advertising remains a reliable source of income. The business model behind AI agents points to an expansion of digital marketing channels. Companies like Google and Meta, the world's largest generators of advertising revenue, see AI as a natural extension of their platforms. Amazon, which already occupies the third place in global advertising revenue, generated $50 billion in this area last year. Even Apple, known for its hardware, expects to reach $10 billion in advertising revenue by 2025. This suggests that AI agents are not a threat to OTAs, but rather a new field of play where the latter may have an advantage. The idea that tourism providers will be able to surpass OTAs through direct offers to AI agents seems unlikely. Three key factors position OTAs as the future protagonists in this ecosystem: domain expertise in auction strategies, trust and brand recognition, and robust technological infrastructure. The arrival of AI agents will not mark the end of OTAs, but rather the beginning of a new stage in their evolution. Instead of eliminating intermediaries, AI may consolidate its role as central pillars in the distribution of tourism. The key to success for both OTAs and providers will be to adapt to this change, understanding that in the world of technology, size and experience often tip the balance, concludes Perell\u00f3.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 02:05 PM\nSource:[prensa-latina.cu](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/01/10/experto-aborda-relacion-de-la-ia-y-el-turismo/)\n\n**The State of Artificial Intelligence in 2024: Trends and Developments**\nThe year 2024 was marked by significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). The emergence of 'reasoning' models, which differ from traditional neural networks, has been a notable trend. These models, such as OpenAI's o1, have shown improved performance by allowing more time for computation. The o3 model, also developed by OpenAI, has achieved unprecedented results in various areas, including programming and human-level performance in the ARC-AGI test. This represents a significant progress in AI development, with the creation of the GPT-4 model taking three years after the release of GPT-3. OpenAI has become a commercial entity, with a significant restructure to attract investments. The company has raised $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, but investors have imposed a condition that the company must become commercially viable within three years. This has led to a lawsuit from Elon Musk, one of the company's founders and early investors, and Meta has also expressed its concerns. Additionally, OpenAI has faced internal issues, with most of the original team led by Sam Altman leaving the company. Quantum computing has also made significant progress, with Google's Willow chip being released. This chip can perform complex calculations in under five minutes, a feat that would take modern supercomputers 10 sextillion years. However, experts are concerned that the rapid progress in quantum computing could compromise existing cryptographic systems, potentially affecting cryptocurrencies. The lack of clear regulations for AI has led to concerns about data ownership and the use of public data. Many creators are suing companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Meta for using their work without permission. The integration of AI in various fields has also raised security concerns, with cybercriminals using AI for phishing attacks, spreading malware, and generating disinformation. The article also discusses the rise of AI agents, which can perform tasks autonomously, and the increasing popularity of generative models, including video generators. Google has released its own generative model, SearchGPT, and Perplexity AI has also released its own model using OpenAI and Anthropic technology. The article concludes by discussing the need for regulation in the AI industry, with the European Union being a leader in this area. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 29, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[devby.io](https://devby.io/news/iskusstvennyi-intellekt-v-2024-vse-vazhnye-trendy-za-god)\n\n**As tech firms look to translate the promise of AI in 2025, 3 clear templates emerge**\nAs the tech industry looks to translate the promise of AI in 2025, three clear templates emerge.

According to Cahn, the main players in the AI market are developing different strategies to catch up with the capabilities of GPT-4. Google is focusing on vertical integration, using its internal chip development and building its own data centers. Microsoft/OpenAI is capitalizing on its powerful brands and ChatGPT, which is the most used AI in the world, and has seen revenue growth. Amazon/Anthropic is investing heavily and has become a magnet for top talent, attracting researchers from competitors. xAI is growing rapidly and has the support of Elon Musk's X and his wallet, while Meta is doubling down on open-source models and has the bases of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. As these companies execute their strategies, we will see some players advancing and others potentially falling behind in 2025, says Cahn. The potentialized search for AI is emerging as a potentially revolutionary application, with industry observers anticipating a fragmentation of the search market, with specialized AI search mechanisms serving specific professions, segments, and uses. This trend may lead to a bifurcation between consumer and business search solutions, with different search mechanisms adapted to the needs and workflows of users. Companies like Perplexity are already gaining traction. As for funding, after a season of ultra-aggressive spending, 2025 is expected to bring a stabilization of investments. With the main players firmly established in the AI ecosystem, Sequoia predicts that the focus will shift from rapid expansion to execution and delivery of results for clients. As new data center capacity comes online, AI prices are expected to continue falling, making it easier for companies to adopt. This may pressure the profitability of Big Techs, but it also has huge potential to stimulate the emergence of new creative solutions, in countless 'garages' around the world...\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 11, 2024 09:37 AM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/byte/tecnologia-e-solucoes/o-que-esperar-de-2025-para-o-mundo-da-ia,797b0f01db030aaf3282276a6c8ac2e54n5o09wo.html)\n\n**OpenAI Considers Introducing Ads to ChatGPT Platform**\nOpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT chatbot, is considering introducing ads to its platform. According to an interview with Sarah Friar, OpenAI's CFO, the company is exploring a revenue model that includes advertising. This move could be a response to the high costs of training AI models. However, Friar later clarified that 'our current business is experiencing rapid growth and we see significant opportunities within our existing business model. While we are open to exploring other revenue streams in the future, we have no active plans to run ads.' It remains to be seen whether OpenAI will actually introduce ads to its platform. In contrast, its competitor Perplexity AI has already started using ads as a revenue stream.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 04, 2024 03:18 PM\nSource:[computerbild.de](https://www.computerbild.de/artikel/cb-News-Internet-ChatGPT-Diese-Nutzer-bekommen-wohl-bald-Werbung-angezeigt-39220191.html)\n\n**OpenAI Considers Adding Ads to ChatGPT, but Users are Concerned**\nOpenAI is considering adding ads to ChatGPT, according to Sarah Friar, the company's chief financial officer. However, Friar clarified that no active advertising project is currently underway, and the company is focusing on its current model based on API usage fees. OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in funding, which will be used to offset the costs of developing its AI models. The company is shifting towards a more traditional business model to accelerate growth and maximize commercial opportunities. This move is not unique to OpenAI, as other companies in the sector, such as Perplexity, are also experimenting with advertising models to ensure a return on investment. However, users are concerned that ads will disrupt the fluidity of interactions with ChatGPT, turning it into a 'billboard'.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 04, 2024 06:57 AM\nSource:[lebigdata.fr](https://www.lebigdata.fr/des-pubs-dans-chatgpt-ce-changement-qui-pourrait-bientot-tout-gacher)\n\n",

Given that in recent years, numerous tech companies have taken advantage of the Super Bowl's extensive reach (e.g., Amazon, Google), it seems plausible that companies within the AI sector might similarly exploit this platform. The Super Bowl provides an unparalleled audience reach, which can be attractive for emerging tech companies looking to assert their brand presence. However, the actual participation depends on the marketing strategies and budgets of these companies. Thus, using the historical participation rate of tech companies in the Super Bowl, which has been roughly 20%, I estimate an initial probability for an AI company like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Perplexity running an ad at the Super Bowl in 2025.",
