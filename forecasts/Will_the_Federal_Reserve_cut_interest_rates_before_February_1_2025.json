    "description": "According to the Federal Reserve's [target funds rate history page](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the most recent rate cuts were on November 8, 2024 and September 19, 2024, after a few years of relatively higher and rising interest rates. Previous cuts were on March 16, 2020, and March 3, 2020. Before then, there were three separate rate cuts in 2019.",

In recent years, two cuts occurred in September and November 2024, suggesting possible economic adjustments. Given historical patterns, we can consider the occurrences of rate cuts happening several times within short periods when economic uncertainty is high or when there are signs that economic growth is stalling. However, such cuts usually follow significant economic downturns or data releases that justify immediate action. The recent cuts suggest some economic urgency, but without publicly available major economic shifts or crises, the historical base for such a short-term subsequent cut is relatively low, approximately 10%.",

Given that we are on January 27, 2025, and the question requires a rate cut announcement by February 1, 2025, the window of opportunity is very narrow, spanning only four days. Historically, the Federal Reserve tends to pre-schedule its meetings with predetermined agendas, thus making an unscheduled rate cut announcement less likely unless responding to an unexpected crisis. Based on the pattern of pre-scheduled meetings and considering only five days since the last potential known move, a base rate for another imminent rate cut could be estimated low, such as 10%.

Bal stated, 'If we see a more cautious tone, there may be some pressure on gold and the general market.' The FED is expected to make a decision on interest rate cuts in the coming months, possibly between May and July.

Trump has called for an immediate interest rate cut, saying 'I know more about interest rates than they do' in a reference to the Federal Reserve officials. Trump believes that cutting interest rates will reduce borrowing costs for companies, leading to a decline in inflation, which is seen as an intervention in monetary policy decisions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 09:26 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news-banking/details/2025/1/27/2716566/%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%B2%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A3-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%87-%D8%BA%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%85-%D8%B3%D8%B9%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AF%D8%A9)\n\n**Trump's Call for Rate Cut Meets Skepticism from Wall Street Analysts**\nUS President Trump has expressed his desire for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, but Wall Street analysts are skeptical. According to Thanos Papasavvas, founder of ABP Invest, the Fed will not lower interest rates in 2025 and may even raise them as early as September. He believes that Trump's policies will push up inflation expectations and force the Fed to raise interest rates. Dan Ivascyn, investment director at Pimco, also expects the Fed to keep interest rates stable in the near future, but notes that a rate hike is possible. The US banking sector has also stated that the Fed's rate-cutting cycle has ended and that the focus should shift to raising interest rates. If the core personal consumption expenditure price index exceeds 3%, it could have a significant impact on the economy.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 08:42 AM\nSource:[ET Net](https://www.etnet.com.hk/www/tc/news/home_categorized_news_detail.php?newsid=ETN350127355)\n\n**FED Interest Rate Decision: When Will It Be Announced?**\nThe Federal Reserve (FED) is expected to announce its January interest rate decision on January 29, 2025. Investors and economists are closely following the outcome of this meeting, as the FED's interest rate decisions have a significant impact on global markets. The FED's decision will be influenced by inflation and employment data. Economists expect the FED to keep interest rates unchanged in this meeting, but there are expectations of a rate cut in the coming months, with a total of 50-75 basis points of rate cuts predicted for 2025.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 07:52 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/haberler/fed-faiz-karari-ne-zaman-aciklanacak-ocak-ayi-18305183-haberi/)\n\n**Central Banks Take Center Stage as Investors Look to 2025**\nThe attention of investors is now focused on central banks, following a week of global financial market purchases, including the appointment of Donald Trump as US President and his initial executive orders, which suggest a less aggressive approach to tariffs. The Bank of Japan has increased interest rates to 0.50%, as widely expected, but has predicted higher inflation and slower growth in the coming years. It has also warned that interest rates will continue to rise, to levels not seen in Japan since 1995. The European Central Bank is expected to continue its monetary policy easing, with a possible further interest rate cut in its meeting on January 30. Analysts predict a second rate cut in March. The Federal Reserve meeting at the end of January is expected to leave interest rates unchanged, following three consecutive cuts in the second half of 2024. The Bank of England's decision will be made in early February, with analysts predicting a 25 basis point rate cut due to falling inflation.

Market analysts expect the Fed to maintain its current interest rate, but there is a possibility of a rate cut in 2025. The Fed's decision is closely watched by investors, who are concerned about the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on the US economy. Trump has publicly called for the Fed to cut interest rates, saying he knows more about interest rates than the Fed. This has raised concerns about the Fed's independence and the potential for political interference. The European Central Bank, Swedish Central Bank, Canadian Central Bank, Brazilian Central Bank, and South African Central Bank will also make decisions on interest rates this week. Market analysts expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, while the Swedish Central Bank and Canadian Central Bank are also likely to cut rates. PIMCO's chief investment officer, Ivascyn, believes that the Fed needs to wait for further clarification on Trump's policies and US economic data before making a decision. He also notes that the current US stock and bond valuation gap is near historical extremes, and that a 'hawkish' Fed policy could put pressure on US stocks. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the US economy, the current data suggests that the US economy is showing resilience. The US job market remains stable, with low unemployment rates, and consumer confidence and spending are relatively stable. These factors make the Fed more cautious in considering further easing policies. Additionally, the persistence of inflation is a key concern for the Fed. Although inflation rates have decreased, they remain above the Fed's 2% target. Sticky inflation means that prices adjust slowly, even if economic growth slows, and inflation may remain at a higher level. This makes the Fed weigh the inflation risk when considering rate cuts. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8gTcB0GAv6U)\n\n**There is one key reason a February rate cut is unlikely**\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is unlikely to cut interest rates in February, despite expectations of a low inflation rate. The RBA cuts interest rates when unemployment goes up, not when inflation comes down. The current unemployment rate is 4%, and the RBA's goal is to keep it at the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU), which is estimated to be 4.5%. However, some economists believe the NAIRU is lower, around 4.25% or 4%. The RBA will consider the latest data on wage growth and unemployment rate, but it's unlikely to cut rates next month. The RBA is conservative and slow to move, and the minutes of the December meeting suggest that they will wait for further economic data before making a decision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 07:53 PM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-27/rba-rate-cut-in-february-will-not-happen-unemployment/104860912)\n\n**This week will make or break the case for a rate cut in February**\nThis week's economic data releases will be crucial in determining the Reserve Bank's decision on interest rates in February. The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release the Consumer Price Index for the December quarter and monthly indicator on Wednesday, January 29, 2025. Analysts expect a significant divergence between the headline and underlying inflation results, with government energy rebates and cost-of-living assistance complicating the picture. The Reserve Bank will focus on the underlying figure when making its rate decision next month, according to the article. 'There will be another significant divergence between the headline and the underlying or trimmed mean inflation result this quarter,' the article states. 'The RBA will largely be focusing on the underlying figure when it makes its rate decision next month.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 01:01 PM\nSource:[capitalbrief.com](https://www.capitalbrief.com/article/this-week-will-make-or-break-the-case-for-a-rate-cut-in-february-eb300551-fe28-43cb-a03b-cf36f5a95fd7/preview/)\n\n**The Fed's Worst Nightmare Is Becoming Reality**\nThe Federal Reserve's (Fed) dovish rate cuts have led to rising manufacturing and services prices, with inflation expected to increase further over the next six months. According to January's data, CPI swaps are pricing a 0.3% m/m increase for January and February, complicating the Fed's 2% inflation target. The market expects only one rate cut in 2025, and experts suggest that Jerome Powell should push back on early rate cuts and signal that the Fed is on hold. Rising nominal rates and inflation expectations suggest that the Fed should avoid signaling further rate cuts before July to prevent exacerbating inflation fears.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[biztoc.com](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752049-fed-worst-nightmare-becoming-reality?ref=biztoc.com)\n\n**How a February rate cut could affect Australian property in 2025**\nA potential February rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could bring back confidence to the Australian housing market in 2025, according to experts. Ray White chief economist Nerida Conisbee says an early interest rate cut could lead to a quick downturn and potentially stop price declines in Melbourne or see price growth pick up again in Sydney. However, she notes that the bigger question is how many rate cuts are likely to be seen, which is currently unknown. McGrath Estate Agents founder John McGrath expects the RBA to cut rates for several more months and says it will likely take a lowering of at least 75 basis points before families start to feel mortgage relief. Conisbee warns that an early rate cut could lead to increased competition and rising prices, while Propertyology head of research Simon Pressley says it would add more 'energy and enthusiasm' into competitive markets. The Federal Government's Help to Buy scheme is also expected to provide 'meaningful support' for first homebuyers, but Conisbee notes that undersupply remains a driving force for price growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 06:00 PM\nSource:[news.com.au](https://www.realestate.com.au/news/how-a-february-rate-cut-could-affect-australian-property-in-2025/?campaignType=external&campaignChannel=syndication&campaignName=ncacont&campaignContent=&campaignSource=newscomau&campaignPlacement=strap)\n\n**RBI rate cut delay will lead to more growth sacrifice; must deliver 0.25% reduction in Feb review - ETCFO**\nDeutsche Bank suggests that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should start reducing key interest rates by 0.25% in February.

The Federal Reserve meets 8 times a year to determine the main interest rate in the country, in an attempt to control the rapidly rising inflation levels in recent times. The schedule for the Federal Reserve's meetings to determine the interest rate in 2025 is as follows: The first meeting will be held on January 31 - February 1, 2025. The second meeting will be held on March 21-22, 2025. The third meeting will be held on May 2-3, 2025. The fourth meeting will be held on June 13-14, 2025. The fifth meeting will be held on July 25-26, 2025. The sixth meeting will be held on September 19-20, 2025. The seventh meeting will be held on October 31-November 1, 2025. The eighth and final meeting of the year will be held on December 12-13, 2025. In its last meeting in 2024, the Federal Reserve decided to lower the main interest rate on Wednesday, December 18, 2024, by a quarter of a percentage point for the second time in a row. Recently, there has been a sense of unease in the market due to concerns about rising inflation and the possibility of the Federal Reserve reducing interest rates and discussing trade policies that President-elect Donald Trump will take. Major brokerage companies said that the uncertainty surrounding US policies may lead to a slowdown in global economic growth in 2025 and fuel volatility in global markets.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 12:27 AM\nSource:[cairo24.com](https://www.cairo24.com/2146504)\n\n**Business News | RBI Likely to Follow the Path of Shallow Rate Cut in Feb MPC Meeting: Report | LatestLY**\nA report by Sharekhan suggests that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may opt for shallow rate cuts in its upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting in February 2025. This decision comes amidst a cautious global economic environment, where the US Federal Reserve has recently cut interest rates by 25 basis points with a more hawkish tone, signaling concerns over inflation and a strong US economy. The RBI is likely to follow a similar path of shallow rate cuts to balance growth concerns and inflationary risks. According to the report, 'The Fed is projecting stronger economy, and more inflation concerns which will lower the rate cut expectation. The RBI will also follow the path of shallow rate cut'. The RBI has revised its CPI inflation projection for FY25 upward to 4.8 per cent from 4.5 per cent, factoring in persistent inflationary pressures. However, the recent decline in CPI inflation and the anticipation of a continued easing trend could provide room for the central bank to consider rate cuts to support the slowing economy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 04:49 AM\nSource:[LatestLY](https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/business-news-rbi-likely-to-follow-the-path-of-shallow-rate-cut-in-feb-mpc-meeting-report-6553795.html)\n\n**Expert: Fed's December Rate Cut Was an 'Incorrect Step'**\nJohn Hilsenrath, founder of Serpa Pinto Advisory, believes that the recent 25 basis point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December was 'an incorrect step'.

Hilsenrath suggests that for future rate cuts, there needs to be 'real, tangible' improvement in the inflation situation. Although he hints at the possibility of a rate cut in March 2025, he states that the probability of easing policy in January or February is zero. However, he expresses significant concern about the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 25, 2024 08:03 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/economy-news/article-2608967)\n\n**Will RBI's new Guv usher a growth-propping rate cut in 2025?**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under new governor Sanjay Malhotra will have to decide on interest rates in February, with some analysts expecting a rate cut.

Malhotra has pointed to growth, stability, and trust as his focus areas, and has exhorted staffers to strive for perfection in performing their critical roles. The RBI under former governor Shaktikanta Das resisted pressures to cut interest rates through 2024, keeping its focus on inflation. Das, who demitted office at the end of 2024, had said that he acted as per the provisions of the statutes which stipulate focusing on inflation while being cognizant of growth. The RBI has kept the key rates unchanged for the 11th consecutive bi-monthly policy reviews, and experts expect some clarity on aspects such as the RBI's stance on cryptocurrency and the e-rupee in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 22, 2024 05:12 PM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://www.rediff.com/business/report/will-rbis-new-guv-usher-a-growth-propping-rate-cut/20241222.htm)\n\n**RBI's Rate Cut Delayed to 2025 Amid Fed's Hawkish Stance**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to delay its interest rate reduction initiatives until April 2025, according to a report from Yes Bank. This potential delay is attributed to the Federal Reserve's shift to a more hawkish approach to monetary policy, following its decision to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments suggest that the monetary policy stance is moving closer to neutral, impacting global financial markets. The strengthening US dollar and rising US Treasury yields pose challenges for emerging markets, including India, where the RBI must balance domestic growth against inflation risks.

The Fed has stated that economic activity has increased in the US, but inflation remains high. The central bank has increased its inflation forecast for 2025 to 2.5% from 2.1%. The Dow Jones plummeted by 1100 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell by 3% and 3.3% respectively. The Fed's decision has been met with disappointment, as investors had expected four rate cuts in 2025. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is also expected to cut interest rates in its upcoming monetary policy meeting in February 2025, following a decrease in inflation in November and expected relief in the coming months.

This approach differs from the European Central Bank's 1 percentage point reduction this year and the U.S. Federal Reserve's more aggressive cuts.

This move has sent the Aussie dollar plummeting to its lowest level in over two years. Despite this, Aussies remain hopeful of an interest rate drop when the Reserve Bank of Australia meets in February 2025. Markets predict a 73 per cent chance of a rate cut, with NAB's chief economist Alan Oster predicting a cut in April or May 2025. However, some experts, such as Chris Richardson from Rich Insight, believe a February rate cut is possible if the next inflation figures are low.

However, the most relevant aspect may be what the central bank signals about its monetary policy plans for 2025. Economists from the three largest investment banks in the world - Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan Chase - predict that the Federal Reserve will reduce the interest rate to 4.25%-4.5%, the lowest level since February 2023. This would be a complete point percentage drop from the range of 5.25%-5.5% in which it was between July and September 2023. The operators agree, with a 98.8% probability of a 25 basis point cut on Wednesday, according to the FedWatch tool from the CME group. Economists from BofA, Goldman, and JPMorgan expect the median projection to decrease from four 25 basis point cuts in 2024 to three, projecting a target range of 3.5%-3.75% for the end of 2025. However, the market shows less conviction, assigning as the most likely scenarios for the end of next year ranges of 3.75%-4% and 4%-4.25%, according to the FedWatch Tool. It is clear that Americans will have to get used to higher interest rates in the long term, as it is very likely that they will remain above 3% for an extended period. This threshold was not reached between 2009 and 2021.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 06:02 PM\nSource:[forbesargentina.com](https://www.forbesargentina.com/money/se-espera-reserva-federal-anuncie-otro-recorte-tasa-interes-25-puntos-basicos-cual-panorama-2025-n64574)\n\n**Markets Await Crucial Decisions from Major Central Banks**\nAs the end of 2024 approaches, financial markets are eagerly awaiting key decisions from major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. The Federal Reserve is expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points at its final meeting of 2024 on Wednesday, marking the third consecutive rate cut. Despite the rate cut being fully priced in by the markets, investors are focused on any hints about future rate cuts in 2025. The Federal Reserve is also expected to provide an update on its economic outlook, which will help determine the future direction of interest rates. According to City Group analysts, 'this week's meeting may be less hawkish than expected, as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell may be more likely to slow down rate cuts if inflation rises or unemployment falls rapidly.' In Japan, the Bank of Japan is expected to remain stable in its monetary policy at its meeting this week, as forecasts suggest it will continue to delay raising interest rates pending additional data on wages and clarification of President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates at 4.75% at its meeting on Thursday, with any decision on cutting rates expected to be delayed until February 2025.

However, Bullock noted that the board has removed its hawkish approach and dropped its usual warning about the need to 'stay vigilant to the upside risks of inflation'. This has led some experts to believe that the RBA may cut interest rates in early 2025, with three of the Big Four banks forecasting a cut in May. Yahoo Finance contributor Stephen Koukoulas suggested that the RBA could cut the cash rate by 0.50 per cent in February, while others are more pessimistic, including Professor Richard Holden, who expects homeowners to get relief until at least 2026. Bullock warned that prices are not going back to where they were before high inflation, and that cost-of-living pressures remain a 'burden on all Australians'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 10, 2024 05:45 AM\nSource:[au.news.yahoo.com](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/rba-detail-signals-early-2025-interest-rate-cut-after-mortgage-holders-denied-relief-054554691.html)\n\n**Major banks RBA interest rate cut predictions days before crucial 2024 call for struggling mortgage holders**\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is set to make its final decision of the year on Tuesday, with the central bank under pressure to provide mortgage relief to millions of homeowners. The big four banks are divided on when the RBA will deliver interest rate cuts, with NAB, Westpac, and ANZ predicting no cut until May 2025, while Commonwealth Bank believes a rate cut in February 2025 is possible. CBA senior economist Belinda Allen said, 'This seems optimistic and we believe these forecasts are too strong,' citing lower-than-expected GDP figures and softer wages growth. The cash markets now predict an even chance of a rate cut in February, up from 25 per cent before GDP figures dropped. Reserve Bank governor Michele Bullock said the inflation target won't be reached until 2026, but the board needs to be 'confident' that inflation is falling towards the target range.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 07, 2024 07:00 PM\nSource:[au.news.yahoo.com](https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/major-banks-rba-interest-rate-cut-predictions-days-before-crucial-2024-call-for-struggling-mortgage-holders-190020347.html)\n\n",
