According to Univisi\u00f3n, the incident occurred on March 3, 2024, at 3:20 pm, on flight WN733, which was still at the William P. Hobby airport in Houston, but in motion. The woman, who was described as a passenger, got up from her seat, removed her clothes, including her hat and shoes, and started walking through the cabin. At one point, she even knocked on the pilots' cabin door demanding to be let in. The situation lasted for approximately 30 minutes until an agent intervened, covering the woman with a blanket. The plane returned to the gate and the woman was removed without charges. She was taken for a medical evaluation by the Houston police. The flight was delayed for over an hour before finally taking off for Phoenix. According to the FAA, incidents involving unruly passengers have decreased in recent years, from nearly 6,000 in 2021 to 2,100 last year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 07:06 PM\nSource:[El Nuevo Diario](https://elnuevodiario.com.do/video-mujer-se-desnuda-y-causa-retraso-en-vuelo-de-southwest-con-destino-a-phoenix/)\n\n**Are Plane Accidents Increasing? ANAC Assures Aviation Sector Remains the Safest**\nThe recent news of plane accidents may give the impression that air travel is becoming less safe, but is this really the case? The Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) assures that the aviation sector is 'the most regulated' and has 'constant supervision'. According to the BBC Verify service, the data shows that over the past two decades, the general trend has been a reduction in the number of air accidents. However, the increasing number of shocking images and accidents has led to a change in passenger perception. ANAC states that 'having regard to the attributions and competences of ANAC, the regulatory entity of civil aviation, we can assert that this sector is the most regulated and regulated, with mandatory requirements and standards, subject to periodic inspections and audits, with constant supervision'. The agency also explains that this supervision occurs 'both nationally and internationally, with its personnel, namely aeronautical, obliged to specific and rigorous training, with mandatory legal imperatives, both physically and in terms of proficiency'. The ANAC also notes that the plane remains the safest mode of transportation in the world, with a ratio of 0.0000000284 fatal accidents per flight in 2023. However, the recent accidents have raised concerns, and the former chief investigator of air disasters in Finland, Ismo Aaltonen, said that 'it is a great misfortune to have observed this period with several types of accidents', but 'people should not draw conclusions based on them, as they are very different cases'. Aaltonen concluded that some of the recent incidents were unpredictable.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 08:59 AM\nSource:[Not\u00edcias ao Minuto](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/economia/2741074/mais-acidentes-aviao-ainda-e-o-meio-de-transporte-mais-seguro-do-mundo)\n\n**Flight attendant injured while restraining unruly passenger on Plus Ultra flight**\nA flight from Madrid to Caracas turned chaotic when a passenger attempted to open an emergency exit mid-flight, leading to a struggle in which a flight attendant suffered a fractured leg. The incident occurred on Plus Ultra L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas Flight 701, where the passenger had been disturbing others on board and was relocated to another seat after slapping and shouting at a fellow traveler. However, he attempted to open an emergency exit, prompting flight attendants to restrain him. The attendant sustained a partial fracture of the fibula during the struggle, but the airline confirmed that he has received medical treatment and will be unable to work for several weeks. The passenger was eventually restrained and taken into custody by local authorities upon arrival in Caracas, about 30 minutes ahead of schedule. The airline reassured that at no point was the safety of the flight or its passengers at risk, citing the significant pressure difference between the cabin and the outside environment that keeps the doors securely shut.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 05:21 PM\nSource:[Aviation24.be](https://www.aviation24.be/airlines/plus-ultra/flight-attendant-injured-while-restraining-unruly-passenger/)\n\n**Paura e percezione: quando l'emotivit\u00e0 supera la realt\u00e0**\nRecent air travel safety incidents have sparked public concern, but data suggests that flying remains as safe as ever. A survey by AP-NORC found that the percentage of Americans who consider flying safe decreased from 71% in 2024 to 64% in February 2025, while those who see it as dangerous increased from 12% to 20%. This discrepancy between data and perception shows how media attention can deeply influence collective feelings of safety. The effect of perception on reality is not new, as seen after the 9/11 attacks, when air travel plummeted, but road accidents and fatalities increased. In reality, the post-2001 period was one of the safest in aviation history, with stricter security measures and more severe controls at major US airports. Media coverage of shark attacks in 2001 also fueled public fear, with some outlets criticizing people who wanted to enjoy the beach that summer. The recent history of perceived threats has seen numerous cases where perception has surpassed reality, such as the alleged sightings of unidentified drones in New Jersey last fall, which sparked conspiracy theories and fears of an impending threat, but were later confirmed to be authorized by the FAA. The tendency to overreact to perceived emergencies is also illustrated by the 1973 'Great Toilet Paper Crisis,' where a joke by comedian Johnny Carson sparked a panic among American consumers, leading to a surge in demand and empty shelves in supermarkets. This phenomenon self-sustained, with media amplifying the perception of scarcity, ultimately leading to rationing. However, it was later discovered that there was never a real shortage, but only an unjustified alarm generated by misinformation and the public's impulsive reaction.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 03:44 PM\nSource:[MeteoWeb](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2025/03/paura-percezione-emotivita-realta-aereo-squali-droni-carta-igienica/1001755592/)\n\n**False mid-air collision warnings over Washington DC airport investigated in aftermath of deadly crash**\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating reports of false mid-air collision warnings near Washington DC's Ronald Reagan National Airport on Saturday (1 March). Several commercial flights received repeated warnings of other aircraft in their vicinity from the onboard Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), despite no other planes being in the area. This incident comes one month after a deadly crash near the airport, where 67 people were killed. According to CBS News, at least 12 flight crews reported false TCAS alerts between 6am and 10am local time. Three pilots chose to abort landings and perform a 'go-around' manoeuvre. Robert Sumwalt, former chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, said, 'I've never heard of something like this.' The FAA is investigating why the alerts occurred, with one air traffic controller telling pilots, 'It's been happening all morning. Let me know if you see anything. No one else has seen anything except for on the TCAS.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 12:18 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/false-mid-air-collision-warnings-121101519.html)\n\n**Aviation Becoming Safer? Statistics Confirm the Trend**\nAccording to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the number of fatal accidents in aviation has decreased over the years. In 2024, there were 7 fatal accidents out of 40.6 million flights, which is a significant improvement compared to the 5-year average of 5 fatal accidents. However, the fatality rate during flights has increased, with 244 fatalities reported in 2024, compared to 72 in 2023. The fatality rate remains low, at 0.06, which is lower than the 5-year average of 0.10. In most regions, the safety coefficient has improved, but in North America, the situation has worsened. IATA's Willie Walsh stated, 'Even with recent high-profile aviation accidents, it's essential to remember that accidents are extremely rare. In 2024, there were 40.6 million flights and 7 fatal accidents. Ten years ago, the average was one accident for every 456,000 flights. Today, it's one accident for every 810,000 flights.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 10:52 AM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/world/observe/aviatsija-u-sviti-staje-bezpechnishoju-statistika-pidtverdila-trend-1047902.html)\n\n**Mid-Air Drama Triggers Panic As Unruly Passenger Tries To Open Emergency Door Onboard Madrid-Caracas Flight; Video Goes Viral**\nOn a Plus Ultra Airlines flight from Madrid to Caracas on February 28, an unruly passenger attempted to open the emergency door mid-air, causing panic among other passengers. According to a flight rep, the passenger was 'restless' and 'annoying the person in the next seat with shouts and slapping him while he was asleep.' The crew intervened and restrained the passenger, securing him in the back of the plane until arrival. The passenger was detained after landing, and one flight attendant sustained injuries. 'Immediately, our cabin crew subdued the passenger and, following the action protocol, secured him in the back of the plane until he reached the destination,' said a Plus Ultra spokesperson.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 08:20 AM\nSource:[Free Press Journal](https://www.freepressjournal.in/world/mid-air-drama-triggers-panic-as-unruly-passenger-tries-to-open-emergency-door-onboard-madrid-caracas-flight-video-goes-viral)\n\n**Panik in 10,000 Metern H\u00f6he! Fluggast will Flugzeugt\u00fcr \u00f6ffnen**\nA passenger on flight 701 from Madrid to Caracas attempted to open the emergency exit of the Airbus A330 at an altitude of 10,000 meters. The dramatic scenes were captured on video. The passenger, who had been causing a disturbance earlier in the flight, was restrained by crew members and other passengers. According to Plus Ultra, the airline, the crew 'immediately brought the passenger under control and secured him in the rear of the plane, accompanied by two crew members who were lying on the floor to prevent any further conflict.' The incident occurred on February 28, 2024. A flight attendant suffered a partial fracture of the fibula and was unable to work for several weeks. The airline stated that the passenger had been 'unruly and harassing a sleeping passenger with shouting and slapping' before the incident. 'The crew acted quickly to calm the situation between the two passengers and moved the unruly passenger to a different seat where he could not disturb anyone,' the airline said. However, the situation escalated further. 'It is almost impossible to open the emergency exits on modern aircraft like the Airbus A330 due to the pressure differences between the inside and outside air and special mechanical safety features,' the airline noted.

The U.S. aviation industry has been in the spotlight following recent incidents, including a midair collision that killed 67 people and a hard landing of a Delta flight. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a decades-long shortage of air traffic controllers and outdated technology. According to FAA spokesperson Daniels, the agency 'missed its original hiring target by over 500 trainees' during the 35-day government shutdown in 2018 and 2019. Spero noted that recruitment is 'sort of a difficult thing' due to attacks on federal employees. Georgia Congressman Hank Johnson accused Elon Musk of a 'glaring conflict of interest' and 'corruption and cronyism' for trying to replace Verizon's internet contract with his own company, Starlink, without competitive bidding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 08:49 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2025/03/04/aviation-safety-doge-cuts-shutdown-fears/)\n\n**Planes Receive Multiple False Alarms Informing Them of Midair Collisions at D.C. Airport**\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating reports of multiple flights receiving false alarms about midair collisions at Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. According to the FAA, several flight crews received onboard alerts on Saturday, March 1, indicating another aircraft was nearby when no other aircraft were in the area. Some crews executed go-arounds as a result of the alerts. The FAA stated, 'The FAA is investigating why the alerts occurred.' The false alarms appeared on the flights' Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) and were reported by at least 12 flight crews. Robert Sumwalt, a CBS News transportation safety analyst, noted that Saturday's occurrence was out of the ordinary, saying, 'I've never heard of something like this.' The incident comes in the wake of a January 29 collision between an American Airlines plane and a U.S. Army helicopter that left 67 dead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 07:56 PM\nSource:[PEOPLE.com](https://people.com/planes-receive-multiple-false-alarms-informing-them-of-midair-collisions-at-dc-airport-11690483)\n\n**Unruly Passengers on Flights: A Growing Concern for Airlines**\nThe recent trend of unruly passengers on flights has been a growing concern for airlines. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), there has been a significant increase in incidents related to passengers' bad behavior since 2021. In 2023, IATA reported an incident for every 480 flights, compared to one incident for every 568 flights in 2022 and one incident for every 835 flights in 2021. The most common forms of incivility include refusing to follow crew instructions, such as not wearing a seatbelt or smoking, and verbal and physical abuse. Some airlines, like Ryanair, have taken a tough stance and have taken passengers to court for their behavior. For example, a passenger who was heavily intoxicated and forced the crew to divert a flight from Dublin to Lanzarote was sued by Ryanair for \u20ac15,000 in damages. 'We hope this action will deter any future disruptive behavior on board,' said a Ryanair spokesperson. Excessive alcohol consumption is often the cause of unruly behavior, and airlines have strict guidelines in place to prevent it. Passengers who are deemed to be intoxicated can be refused boarding or even removed from the flight. Airlines also have the right to limit or prohibit alcohol consumption on board if it poses a risk to safety. 'It's better to prevent than to cure,' said a spokesperson for the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). 'We have strict guidelines in place to prevent unruly behavior, and we will not tolerate it.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 02, 2025 07:01 AM\nSource:[ladepeche.fr](https://www.ladepeche.fr/2025/03/02/avions-violences-insultes-refus-des-consignes-de-securite-quand-les-passagers-incontrolables-menacent-la-securite-des-vols-12509874.php)\n\n**60% of unruly passengers escape prosecution due to loopholes in international aviation law**\nIncivility on flights is not uniformly sanctioned, with 60% of perpetrators escaping prosecution due to loopholes in the Tokyo Convention of 1963. The Convention, ratified by 187 countries, has some flaws, allowing many unruly passengers to go unpunished. The problem lies in the fact that the state in which an aircraft is registered or the airline is based is the only competent authority to handle onboard infractions. When an aircraft lands in another country, local police are often not competent to prosecute, and the perpetrator is usually released. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) claims that this is the reason why prosecutions are not pursued in 60% of cases. To address this legal vacuum, the Montreal Protocol was introduced in 2014 to improve the ability of states to prosecute unruly passengers for acts or infractions committed on flights that land on their territory. However, only 47 countries have ratified this protocol, including France, which represents only 33% of international passenger traffic. 'It is essential that governments and airlines have the necessary legal authority to prosecute unruly passengers, regardless of the aircraft's registration state, and a range of coercive measures that reflect the gravity of the incident,' emphasizes IATA. Efforts to promote the ratification of the protocol continue. In Europe, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Sweden have implemented national programs to reduce the number of incidents involving unruly passengers. These initiatives bring together airlines, airports, ground handling services, police, prosecutors, and airport businesses to prevent and effectively manage disruptive behaviors on flights and in airports. In France, the legal framework was strengthened in 2022 with the introduction of specific administrative and penal sanctions against this type of passenger. The United States has also taken the issue seriously, with passengers who assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with airline crew members facing prosecution and fines of up to $37,000 per offense. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) now reports the most serious cases to the FBI for potential prosecution, resulting in an 80% decrease in incidents involving unruly passengers since 2021.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: March 02, 2025 06:05 AM\nSource:[Ladepeche.fr](https://www.ladepeche.fr/2025/03/02/incivilites-dans-les-avions-pourquoi-60-des-fauteurs-de-troubles-echappent-aux-poursuites-12510014.php)\n\n**IATA Releases 2024 Safety Report: 7 Fatal Accidents on 40.6 Million Flights**\nThe International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released the results of the 2024 safety report, which shows a slight increase in the number of fatal accidents, with 7 incidents occurring on 40.6 million flights. The fatality rate has also increased, with 244 lives lost in 2024, compared to 72 in 2023 and a five-year average of 144. According to IATA, the long-term trend of aviation safety is one of continuous improvement. The organization notes that the number of fatal accidents has decreased from one per 456,000 flights in 2011-2015 to one per 810,000 flights in 2020-2024. IATA Director General Willie Walsh stated, 'We know that every fatal accident is too many. We honor the memory of each person who has lost their life in an aviation accident, expressing our deepest condolences and growing determination to make flying even safer.' The report highlights the importance of data collection and analysis in improving safety, as well as the need for global coordination to address issues such as conflict zones and GPS interference. 'The number of GPS interference incidents increased by 175% from 2023 to 2024, and the number of GPS spoofing cases increased by 500%,' said IATA. 'This is a deliberate and unacceptable risk to civil aviation,' the organization emphasized.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 06:35 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/02/28/bezopasnost-grazhdanskoj-aviacii-v-2024-godu-snizilas-po-sravneniiu-s-2023-m.html)\n\n**Iata: 'One incident every 880,000 flights: improves five-year average'**\nThe International Air Transport Association (Iata) has released its annual report on safety, highlighting improvements in several key areas, but a step back from the exceptional performance of 2023. The overall incident rate of 1.13 per million flights (one incident every 880,000 flights) was better than the five-year average of 1.25, but worse than the 1.09 recorded in 2023. In 2024, there were seven fatal incidents out of 40.6 million flights, a higher number than the single fatal incident in 2023 and the five-year average of five fatal incidents. The risk of mortality remained low at 0.06, lower than the five-year average (0.10), but double the 0.03 recorded in 2023. 'Even with recent high-profile air crashes, it's essential to remember that incidents are extremely rare,' said Willie Walsh, Iata's director general. 'In 2024, there were 40.6 million flights and seven fatal incidents. The long-term history of air safety is characterized by continuous improvement. A decade ago, the five-year average (2011-2015) was one incident every 456,000 flights. Today, the five-year average (2020-2024) is one incident every 810,000 flights. This improvement is due to the fact that we know that every fatal incident is one too many. We honor the memory of every life lost in an air crash with our deepest condolences and with an ever greater determination to make flying even safer. And for this, the accumulation of safety data, including the 2024 safety report, is our most powerful tool.' The Iata has also highlighted the importance of the Safer Skies initiative, established after the PS752 tragedy, to facilitate safety measures in high-risk airspace. The most common incidents in 2024 were tailstrikes and runway excursions, emphasizing the importance of safety measures for takeoff and landing. 'No civil aircraft should ever be a target, deliberate or accidental, of military operations. Governments must intervene, improve information sharing, and establish clearer global protocols to prevent these tragedies and safeguard civil aviation,' concluded Walsh.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 09:06 PM\nSource:[La Repubblica](https://finanza.repubblica.it/News/2025/02/26/sicurezza_trasporto_aereo_iata_un_incidente_ogni_880mila_voli_migliora_media_quinquennale_-221/)\n\n**Plane Crashes Are Decreasing, Despite Recent Incidents**\nRecent plane crashes have raised concerns, but aviation experts point out that the number of accidents is actually decreasing despite the increase in flight numbers. Ey\u00fcp Tur\u015fucu, a retired captain pilot and accident investigation expert, notes that 'statistics show that plane crashes are decreasing. Therefore, we can still say that air travel is the safest mode of transportation. However, there is a significant increase in turbulence events. This is due to changing climate conditions. Severe turbulence, which was less common in the past, is now more frequent due to climate change.' According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the US, the number of plane crashes in the US has generally decreased from 2005 to 2024. In January 2025, the total number of accidents was 52, lower than the 58 in January 2024 and 70 in 2023. Similarly, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) data shows that the accident rate per million flights has decreased from 2005 to 2023 compared to previous years.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[Milliyet](https://www.milliyet.com.tr/gundem/ucak-kazalari-artmiyor-aksine-azaliyor-7314626)\n\n**Is it safe to fly right now? Here\u2019s what the data says**\nThe likelihood of dying in a plane crash is one in 13 million, according to a study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In comparison, the likelihood of being in a car crash is one in 366. Despite recent incidents, including a Delta plane flipped over on the Toronto Airport runway and a deadly mid-air crash between an American Airlines flight and a military helicopter in Washington D.C., the FAA serves more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million passengers on an average day. Dr. Marcie Beigel, a board-certified behavioral analyst, suggests separating facts from feelings and looking for evidence of good travel outcomes to combat fears over flying. She advises focusing on why you're flying and telling yourself the best-case scenario, saying, 'The percentages are actually in our favor, and everything's going to be good, but our brain doesn't know that, so the fear comes up higher.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 03:37 PM\nSource:[pix11.com](https://pix11.com/news/local-news/is-it-safe-to-fly-right-now-heres-what-the-data-says/)\n\n**Still on the three \u2018drunk\u2019 unruly passengers**\nThree passengers who got drunk on an Air Peace flight from London to Lagos disrupted the flight by shouting and violating seating rules.

However, according to Arnold Barnett, a professor of statistics at the MIT Sloan School of Management, the risk of dying in a plane crash is 'proche de z\u00e9ro' (close to zero). Barnett points out that 12 million people fly every day, and the vast majority of the time, no one is injured or killed. In 2024, the rate of accidents was estimated to be 1.2 per million flights, with a probability of fatal accident of around 0.1 per million. This is a significant improvement from a decade ago, when the rate of accidents was 2.15 per million. Experts recommend taking simple precautions, such as always wearing a seatbelt during the flight, to minimize the risks. Barnett notes that the agents of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) undergo annual training in emergency procedures, including handling unruly passengers, cabin fires, and water evacuations. 'Chaque ann\u00e9e, en moyenne, 12 millions de personnes montent \u00e0 bord d'un avion chaque jour, explique Arnold Barnett au quotidien am\u00e9ricain. La grande majorit\u00e9 du temps, aucun passager n'est bless\u00e9, et encore moins tu\u00e9.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 11:10 AM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/entreprises/transports/avec-la-recrudescence-des-accidents-l-avion-est-il-toujours-le-moyen-de-transport-le-plus-sur_AN-202502190444.html)\n\n**Air Passengers Causing Disturbances on Flights: Experts Call for Stricter Measures**\nThe number of air passengers causing disturbances on flights is increasing. According to data from Russian airlines, the number of incidents rose by 23% in 2023 compared to the previous year, and by 39% in the first half of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The head of Aeroflot, Sergey Alexandrovsky, reported that the company recorded 800 cases of unruly behavior on flights, with five instances of forced landings and 28 instances of the use of restraint measures. Experts are calling for the creation of a unified list of air passengers who have caused disturbances, with a minimum penalty of three years and up to 10 years for repeat offenders. Some experts, such as Andrey Velichko, believe that the punishment should be more severe, including criminal penalties and a ban on flying. Others, like Alexander Starovoitov, argue that the current legislation is already strict enough and that the focus should be on analyzing the causes of the incidents before making any changes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 11:10 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/02/19/ekspert-velichko-aviadeboshirov-nuzhno-nakazyvat-samym-strozhajshim-obrazom.html)\n\n**Aircraft involved in 25 'near midair collisions' over Long Island and Queens since 2019, analysis finds**\nAccording to a Newsday analysis, there have been at least 25 'near midair collisions' over Long Island and Queens since 2019, with 13 of those cases involving commercial passenger planes. The incidents were reported by pilots, air traffic controllers, and dispatchers, and were submitted anonymously to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NASA database. The reports often blame procedural issues or miscommunication between air traffic controllers and pilots for the near misses. Experts point out that the risks of air travel have drastically decreased in recent decades and are much lower than other forms of transportation, including driving. Brian Roggow, associate dean of the College of Aviation at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said that the near misses should be taken seriously, but also be seen in the context of the millions of flights that have taken off or landed over the past six years. 'It doesn't raise the hairs on my back,' he said. Arnold Barnett, a statistics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the risk of a fatality to any individual boarding a commercial aircraft in the United States is about 1 in 100 million. 'If you see a little kid -- let's say at LaGuardia, Kennedy or Islip -- about to get on a flight, that kid is five times as likely to grow up to be president as to perish on the forthcoming flight,' he said. The FAA has not responded to Newsday's inquiry about whether it has conducted formal investigations of Long Island-area incidents or potential changes at the agency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 10:19 AM\nSource:[Newsday](https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/near-miss-aircraft-strikes-kc7x7ynw)\n\n**Are Flight Attendants Legally Allowed To Restrain Passengers?**\nFlight attendants are trained to de-escalate difficult situations, but in the event of an air rage incident, they are legally allowed to restrain passengers under certain conditions. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), over 2,000 incidents of unruly passengers were reported in 2024, a significant decrease from the almost 6,000 incidents in 2021. However, flight attendants must use verbal tools first, give a warning, and then use their discretion to determine whether physical restraint is warranted. 'They are trained to de-escalate difficult situations first, using verbal tools,' said the article. 'The next step would be giving the passenger(s) a warning. Then, if things haven't resolved, they may be called on to physically restrain the passenger.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[islands.com](https://www.islands.com/1784037/flight-attendant-allowed-restrain-passengers-legally/)\n\n**Unruly Passengers on the Rise in Norway: Airlines Take Action**\nThe number of unruly passengers on flights in Norway has been increasing in recent years, with cabin crew facing physical and verbal abuse. In response, airlines have started to remove passengers from flights before departure if they are deemed a security risk. According to the Norwegian Aviation Authority, there were 621 reported incidents of unruly passengers in 2024, compared to 569 in 2023. This translates to almost two incidents per day, year-round. The authority has launched a campaign to address the issue, which has led to increased awareness among airline staff and a rise in reported incidents. However, the number of incidents has not increased in 2024, giving hope that the problem may be under control. David Opsahl Moldskred, a fly operativ inspekt\u00f8r for kabin, said, 'The campaign has led to increased awareness among staff in the industry, and has also contributed to an increase in reported incidents. This gives us better insight into the scope of the problem and allows us to identify patterns and effective measures.' Moldskred also noted that the threshold for removing a passenger from a flight has been lowered, with more passengers being removed before departure. 'This is a clear effect of the campaign,' he said.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 07:27 AM\nSource:[sol.no](https://flysmart24.no/2025/02/07/passasjerer-blir-kastet-av-flyet-for-avgang/)\n\n**Frequent air mishaps spike global anxiety - Businessday NG**\nA series of air mishaps has sparked global anxiety, with several crashes resulting in fatalities. Despite this, experts insist that air travel remains the safest mode of transportation. Anthony Brickhouse, a US-based aviation safety expert, said, 'Air travel remains the safest mode of transportation.' The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has created an independent safety review team to address issues such as inconsistent funding, outdated technology, and short-staffed air traffic control towers. Boeing aircraft have been involved in the majority of the crashes, with several incidents occurring in 2024, including a door panel blowout and an engine fire. However, statistics show that flying is safer than ever, with a risk of death from air travel calculated to be 1 for every 13.7 million passenger boardings in the period 2018-2022. Research also suggests that up to 80 percent of aviation accidents can be attributed to human error, with pilot error accounting for 53 percent of accidents. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 04:30 AM\nSource:[Businessday NG](https://businessday.ng/aviation/article/frequent-air-mishaps-spike-global-anxiety/)\n\n**Ryanair Proposes Two-Drink Limit per Passenger to Reduce Unruly Behavior**\nRyanair has proposed introducing a limit of two drinks per passenger, which would be controlled through in-flight cards, similar to duty-free shopping. The airline believes it's time for EU authorities to take action to limit the sale of alcohol on flights. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the number of incidents involving unruly passengers has increased, with one incident occurring on every 480 flights in 2023, up from one incident per 568 flights in 2022. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also noted a rise in the number and severity of incidents involving passengers since 2020. While statistics on incidents directly related to alcohol consumption are not available, the aviation industry has long emphasized the importance of responsible alcohol service and preventing intoxicated passengers from boarding flights. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported 2,102 incidents involving unruly passengers in the previous year, resulting in fines totaling $7.5 million.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 04:30 AM\nSource:[FAKT24.pl](https://www.fakt.pl/pieniadze/ryanair-chce-wprowadzenia-limitu-2-drinki-na-pasazera/0kxhd3g)\n\n",

Probabilities ranged from 20% to 85%, with most experts estimating probabilities around 50-70%. In Phase 2, after reviewing recent news articles, most experts raised their probabilities by about 5%, reinforcing their initial analyses with reports of ongoing incidents and trends. They acknowledged challenges from FAA reports showing a decrease in overall incidents since 2021. Revised probabilities were mostly between 40% and 90%, with several experts converging around 70-75%. Overall, experts generally agreed that there is a strong likelihood of the incident rate exceeding the historical average in the specified timeframe.",
