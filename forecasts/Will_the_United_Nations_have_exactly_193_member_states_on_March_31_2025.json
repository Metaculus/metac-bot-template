'From Gaza to the Democratic Republic of Congo, passing through Ukraine, Sudan, or Myanmar, the HCDH has, over the past year, sounded the alarm on serious violations and abuses, warned of the risks of escalation, and repeatedly called for an end to the death and suffering of civilians,' said the High Commissioner at the launch in Geneva. 'We have also helped states, national institutions, regional organizations, the UN system as a whole, and the private sector to achieve better results by integrating human rights into their work.' The HCDH has defended humanity during conflicts and in times of peace, in developing countries and advanced economies, from historical grievances to emerging risks. In 2024, 2,000 employees working in 92 countries undertook 11,000 human rights monitoring missions and observed nearly 1,000 trials. They recorded 15,000 human rights violations, supported over 10,000 survivors of contemporary forms of slavery, and over 49,000 survivors of torture and their families. More than 100 detention centers and prisons have reported improvements thanks to the HCDH's efforts. The High Commissioner expressed gratitude to the 95 partners who supported the HCDH, including 67 Member States, and hopes that their engagement will continue and be even stronger in 2025. This year, the HCDH will rely on this essential work by bringing together governments, civil society, the private sector, philanthropic organizations, the scientific community, academia, and many others. The HCDH has requested $500 million this year, of which $269 million was collected, representing a 4% decrease from 2023. 'Human rights are a low-cost and high-impact investment to mobilize the population in favor of peace, security, and sustainable development, and to build social cohesion based on the contributions of each individual,' said the High Commissioner. However, human rights funding remains very insufficient. 'I fear that if we do not reach our funding targets in 2025, people who should be free will remain in prison. Women and girls around the world will remain in the shadows and miss out on many opportunities. Violations and abuses will not be reported, causing gaps in accountability and increased impunity. Human rights defenders will lose the little protection they have,' warned Mr. T\u00fcrk.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:49 PM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/le-hcdh-lance-un-appel-de-500-millions-de-dollars-pour-redynamiser-lappui-mondial-en-faveur-des-droits-humains)\n\n**Most countries late in submitting new climate pledges to UN**\nNearly 200 countries missed the deadline to submit their updated climate pledges to the UN under the Paris Agreement, raising concerns about the global commitment to combating climate change. Only 10 countries, including the UK, Switzerland, and Brazil, met the deadline. China, India, and the European Union have not yet submitted their plans, fueling fears that the decarbonization process could slow down. Experts warn that the delay could create the impression that 'there is no real will to act' and that the world is heading towards a global temperature increase of 2.6 - 2.8\u00b0C, far from the goal of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C. The UN acknowledged the delays and announced that more than 170 countries had pledged to submit their strategies by 2025, most by COP30. The EU and China have committed to submitting their plans by 2025, while the UK is currently on track to meet its commitments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[Ziarul Bursa](https://www.bursa.ro/most-countries-late-in-submitting-new-climate-pledges-to-un-48807452)\n\n**Only 14 Countries Submit New Climate Plans on Time**\nOnly 14 countries out of 200 have submitted their new climate plans to the United Nations on time. The deadline for submitting the new contributions determined at the national level (NDC) was on Monday. Spain, along with the rest of the EU, did not meet the deadline. According to Servimedia, the 14 countries that have submitted their plans are: Brazil, Switzerland, the United States, Botswana, Uruguay, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Lesotho, Andorra, Saint Lucia, Ecuador, Singapore, the Marshall Islands, and Zimbabwe. The countries had committed to submitting new plans every five years to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, as part of the Paris Agreement. The deadline for the third round of NDC submissions was on Monday, nine months before the start of the COP30. The United States submitted its climate plan on December 19, 2024, just before Joe Biden's term ended, but its successor, Donald Trump, has already taken several actions against climate change, including withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. 'We need to increase our efforts to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement,' said a spokesperson for the UN.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:49 AM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/economia-sostenible/2025/02/11/67ab24cd468aebd04b8b4596.html)\n\n**World powers fail to reach climate targets as UN deadline passes**\nThe United Nations' deadline for submitting updated carbon reduction targets passed on 2/10/2025, with nearly all nations failing to deliver their revised commitments on time. Only 10 out of nearly 200 countries met the cut-off, leaving major polluters such as China, India, and the European Union absent from the list. Ebony Holland of the International Institute for Environment and Development noted that 'broad geopolitical shifts' are proving to be a challenge for international cooperation on climate change. Despite the Paris Agreement's requirement for nations to propose more ambitious climate goals for 2035, most G20 countries failed to meet the deadline. The US, UK, and Brazil were among the few exceptions, but the American pledge was largely symbolic. France has struggled to align its climate ambitions with concrete results, and the European Union is only on track to achieve a 51 percent reduction in emissions by 2030, falling short of its 55 percent target. The UN climate chief, Simon Stiell, described this round of climate pledges as 'the most important policy documents of this century', but the slow response from major economies and geopolitical uncertainties complicate efforts to combat climate change.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 04:28 PM\nSource:[rfi.fr](https://www.rfi.fr/en/environment/20250210-world-powers-fail-to-reach-climate-targets-as-un-deadline-passes)\n\n**Most Countries Miss UN Deadline for Climate Goals**\nMost countries have missed the UN deadline to submit new climate goals, with only 10 out of nearly 200 signatory countries meeting the deadline. The countries that submitted their plans include the UK, Switzerland, and Brazil, which will host the upcoming UN Climate Conference in November. Major CO2 producers like China, India, and the European Union did not submit their plans. The US submitted its revised climate plan, but it was developed before the current administration took office and is therefore considered invalid. The EU has announced that it will submit its new plan before the COP30 Climate Conference in Brazil in November. Observers expect China to submit its plans in the second half of 2025. Other countries that met the deadline include the UAE, Ecuador, New Zealand, St. Lucia, Andorra, and Uruguay.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[epochtimes.de](https://www.epochtimes.de/wissen/umwelt/fast-alle-staaten-lassen-un-frist-zur-einreichung-neuer-klimaziele-verstreichen-a5034820.html)\n\n**Italian Companies Join United Nations Global Compact in Record Numbers**\nThe number of Italian companies joining the United Nations Global Compact has increased by 30% in 2024, with 141 new companies bringing the total to 628.

This initiative showcases the organization's unwavering commitment to promoting rural tourism as a driver of sustainable development and inclusion, while celebrating the rich cultural and natural heritage, community values, and sustainable practices that make these destinations unique. Since its creation in 2021, the initiative has received international recognition, with over 800 applications from more than 100 countries in the past four editions. The current Best Tourism Villages network of UNWTO comprises 254 members worldwide, including over 180 recognized villages and 70 participants in the Upgrade Program, representing around 60 countries from five regions. According to UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili, 'The Best Tourism Villages initiative is a tribute to rural destinations where tourism serves as a tool for creating opportunities and promoting cultural preservation and sustainable growth. These villages leverage their unique advantages to foster economic growth, safeguard local traditions, and improve the quality of life for communities.' The 2025 edition of Best Tourism Villages is now open for applications, with a deadline of May 19, 2025. A selection committee will evaluate the applications based on nine fundamental criteria, including cultural and natural resources, economic sustainability, social sustainability, environmental sustainability, and more. The initiative aims to harness tourism as a driver of rural development and well-being, promoting innovative tourism strategies in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 02:29 PM\nSource:[newsinamerica.com](https://newsinamerica.com/pdcc/boletin/2025/onu-turismo-abre-la-convocatoria-para-la-edicion-2025-de-los-best-tourism-villages/)\n\n**Grande Muraille Verte: Declaration of Closure of the Extraordinary Session of the Council of Ministers**\nThe extraordinary session of the Council of Ministers of the Great Green Wall (GMV) was held in Dakar on February 7, 2025, with the participation of ten member countries out of eleven. The meeting allowed for the examination and validation of strategic recommendations to strengthen the operationalization and perpetuation of the Pan-African Agency of the GMV (APGMV). The discussions led to several major decisions: institutional reinforcement, resource mobilization, and acceleration of reform and transition. A recruitment committee for a new executive secretary of the APGMV was established, with the Republic of Mauritania as president, and representatives from Senegal, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, the UN Environment Programme, and the GMV Accelerator. The committee will meet in Mauritania to receive candidate files and propose the best candidates by March 31, 2025. The council decided to initiate a circular meeting in East African countries to increase advocacy among the highest authorities of these countries. All countries committed to settling their arrears of payment of statutory contributions. The process of transferring the presidency of the Council to the Republic of Mali has begun and will be completed by the 5th Summit of Heads of State and Government to be held in Bamako, Mali, before June 30, 2025. The Council of Ministers expressed its deep gratitude to Senegal for the successful organization of the session and reaffirmed its determination to intensify efforts to make the GMV a central lever of climate resilience and sustainable development in Africa.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 11:01 AM\nSource:[vivafrik.com](https://www.vivafrik.com/2025/02/10/grande-muraille-verte-declaration-de-cloture-de-la-session-extraordinaire-du-conseil-des-ministres-a73903.html)\n\n**EXCLUSIVE: Proposals for creation of 31 new states \u2018brought in dead\u2019**\nProposals for the creation of 31 new states in Nigeria are 'dead on arrival' due to procedural errors, according to a lawmaker.

'The starting point, according to the requirements for the creation of states as contained in section 8(1)(a) of the constitution, is the collection of signatures from at least two-thirds of the elected representatives of the affected areas in both chambers of the national assembly and the state houses of assembly. None of this was done. That kills the proposals,' said the lawmaker.

Co-operatives are businesses and enterprises owned by their members, staff, or customers, where profits are returned to investment and members. They are often called Community Interest Companies and are growing in popularity. Research has shown that co-operatives are more efficient when profit is not diverted to foreign shareholders. The Co-operative Party, which has 43 Members of Parliament, is the 'Sister Party' to the Labour Party and promotes co-operative values such as community wealth, local business, and social justice. The party is welcoming new members and encouraging people to get involved in co-operatives, such as the Co-op Group, which is looking for passionate member-owners to join its National Member's Council.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[theisleofthanetnews.com](https://theisleofthanetnews.com/2025/02/10/dick-symonds-2025-is-united-nations-year-of-co-operatives/)\n\n**US Ineligible to Withdraw from UNHRC as Observer**\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) stated that as of January 1, 2025, the United States' membership period has ended, making it ineligible to withdraw from an international organization it no longer belongs to. According to Pascal Sim, UNHRC spokesperson, 'As a matter of principle, and in the spirit of multilateral dialogue that characterizes the Council, we welcome the participation of all member states and encourage them, whether as members of the Council or as observers, to participate in the Council's work and its mechanisms.' The US withdrew from the UNHRC in 2018, but rejoined in 2022 as a full member. Now, as an observer, the US cannot withdraw from the organization it no longer belongs to. 'For the record, the United States was a member of the Human Rights Council from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2024. From January 1, 2025, the United States is no longer a member of the Human Rights Council and becomes automatically an observer state like any of the 193 UN member states that are not members of the Council.

The UN also designated March 21 as World Glacier Day. According to UNESCO, this is an opportunity to 'sensitize the global public opinion' about the fundamental role of these cold masses, as well as the 'economic, social, and environmental repercussions' of the imminent changes in the cryosphere. There are over 275,000 glaciers worldwide, covering approximately 70,000 square kilometers and storing around 70% of the world's freshwater. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) stated that it is 'highly likely' that the melting of the two large ice caps (in Greenland and Antarctica) will continue to raise global sea levels 'for the rest of this century' and predicts that smaller glaciers in Europe, East Africa, the Andes, and Indonesia will lose more than 80% of their ice mass by 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate. However, other studies suggest that the situation is not as clear-cut, as indicated by a report from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), which states that the rate of sea ice loss in Antarctica during the warmest months has slowed 'to levels far below the average' and that by the end of 2024, the extent of sea ice had recovered to 7.3 million square kilometers, ending the year 'very close to the average of 1981 to 2010'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[www.diariolibre.com](https://www.diariolibre.com/planeta/medioambiente/2025/01/20/el-deshielo-de-los-glaciares-una-amenaza-para-los-ecosistemas/2973197)\n\n**IMUN 2025: Empowering Happiness through Culture and Empathy**\nIMUN (Italian Model United Nations) is a simulation of the United Nations General Assembly that will take place in six Italian cities, including Naples, from February 27 to March 1, 2025, and from March 20 to 22, 2025.

He stated, 'Our effectiveness will be measured by our actions. We will be 'action-oriented', delivering on our commitments to UN member states. In the face of current challenges, we must commit to working together to achieve our set goals.' Guterres' priorities focus on the UN's three pillars: peace and security, human rights, and sustainable development. Key areas of focus include: peace and security in Africa; combating the illicit use of small arms and light weapons; protecting human dignity in armed conflicts; eliminating child labor; developing financing; and accelerating progress towards sustainable development goals, particularly through digital means. Additionally, multilingualism and women's empowerment will be core issues throughout the General Assembly session. The UN General Assembly, with 193 member states, serves as a powerful platform for multilateral discussions on all international issues. The 2024 adoption of the 'Future Pact' and its annexes, 'Global Digital Pact' and 'Declaration on Intergenerational Issues', laid the foundation for a new international system to address today's and future challenges. In 2025, Guterres will convene three informal dialogues to support member states in implementing the 'Future Pact' before the General Assembly session ends in September. These dialogues will provide opportunities for open, inclusive, and action-oriented discussions to shape the path forward. Guterres' term is guided by the theme 'Seeking common ground, promoting peace, sustainable development, and upholding human dignity everywhere.' His tenure aims to create an environment where every voice is not only heard but also valued, based on the principle of unity in diversity.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 07:24 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/zh/story/2025/01/1135091)\n\n**UN Renews Algeria's Membership in Committee on Building Peace**\nThe United Nations has renewed Algeria's membership in the Committee on Building Peace for the second consecutive year, as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.

'This is a significant moment for our countries and for the United Nations,' said the UN Secretary-General, 'as we welcome new members who will contribute to the work of the Security Council and help shape the future of our organization.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[telexpresse.com](https://telexpresse.com/366280.html)\n\n**Five New Countries Join the United Nations Security Council**\nThe United Nations has welcomed five new countries to the United Nations Security Council as non-permanent members. The new members are Somalia, Pakistan, Panama, Denmark, and Greece, who will take the seats previously held by Ecuador, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, and Switzerland. Algeria's permanent representative to the United Nations in New York, Ammar Ben Jumaa, expressed his 'sincere gratitude' to the outgoing members for their 'fruitful membership'. Algeria currently holds the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January. The presidency rotates among the permanent and non-permanent members in alphabetical order by English name. The new members were elected by the UN General Assembly in June 2024, receiving two-thirds of the votes from participating member states. They will join the current non-permanent members: Algeria, Guyana, South Korea, Sierra Leone, and Slovenia, whose terms will expire at the end of 2025. The five permanent members of the Security Council, with veto power, are China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[echoroukonline.com](https://www.echoroukonline.com/%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B6%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-5-%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A)\n\n**UN Women Makes Equality of the Sexes and Empowerment of Women and Girls Top Priority in 2025**\nUN Women has made equality of the sexes and the empowerment of women and girls its top priority in 2025. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, adopted by 189 countries at the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China. According to UN Women, this program encompasses the actions taken by women worldwide, especially in the lead-up to International Women's Day, which continues to be a celebration of women leaders around the world. The 2025 International Women's Day, celebrated on March 8, will be themed 'For ALL women and girls', a rallying cry to take action in three key areas: advancing women's and girls' rights, promoting gender equality, and empowering women. Launched under the banner of UN Women's global campaign to mark the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, this edition will be a turning point in the quest for gender equality and women's empowerment worldwide. However, this 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action coincides with a growing security crisis and other crises that are only worsening, eroding trust in democracy and shrinking civic space. 'Last year, 612 million women and girls lived the brutal reality of armed conflicts, a disturbing 50% increase in just a decade,' notes UN Women. Nevertheless, the action plan comes to the rescue in these situations, providing concrete solutions. UN Women confirms that the action plan 'continues to guide policies, programs, and investments that have an impact on critical areas of our lives, such as education, health, peace, political participation, economic empowerment, media, and especially the elimination of violence against women and girls.' Therefore, the urgency is to address 'these issues and prioritize those related to climate justice and the indispensable role of digital technologies, as we are just five years away from the deadline for the Sustainable Development Goals.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 03:19 PM\nSource:[allAfrica.fr](https://fr.allafrica.com/stories/202501020218.html)\n\n**Asia: 2025 Agenda**\nThe United Nations has declared 2025 as the International Year of Cooperatives to highlight the contribution of this form of economic activity to development. The year will also be the International Year of Glaciers, with a special day to be celebrated on March 21. In 2025, Malaysia will assume the presidency of ASEAN, the political, economic, and cultural organization that brings together ten countries in Southeast Asia. The presidency of the G20 will be held by South Africa. The BRICS summit will take place in Brazil, with a date to be determined. Various elections are scheduled to take place in 2025, including parliamentary elections in Tajikistan, the Philippines, and Iraq, as well as presidential elections in Singapore and Kirghizistan. The Expo 2025 will be held in Osaka, Japan, from April 13 to October 13, with the theme 'Designing Future Society for Our Lives.' The Asia Summit on Global Health will take place in Hong Kong on May 26-27, and the Asia Christian Rights Fair will be held in Bangkok, Thailand, on September 1-2. Various religious festivals are also scheduled to take place in 2025, including the Chinese New Year on January 29, the Islamic holy month of Ramadan from February 28 to March 29, and the Hindu festival of Diwali on October 21. The new presidency of the Fabc, the Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences, will begin on January 1, with Cardinal Felipe Neri Ferrao as its new president. The 150th anniversary of the Verbiti missionaries will be celebrated on March 27-29, and the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicea will be commemorated on May 9.

Trump's economic protectionism has also been a concern for the World Trade Organization (WTO). The US is the largest donor to the United Nations and some of its Geneva-based agencies, and a reduction in funding could have a significant impact. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and six states have launched a global initiative to promote international humanitarian law, and a conference of the signatory states will be held in March 2025 to focus on ensuring respect for the fourth Geneva Convention. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) estimates that 305 million people will need humanitarian aid in 2025, but securing the necessary funding will be challenging. The future of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) is also uncertain due to Israeli legislation banning its activities in the West Bank and Gaza. Switzerland is preparing to leave its role as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and will become a member of the UN Human Rights Council, which it will chair in 2025. The council will also finalize the international treaty on pandemics in 2025, but negotiations are ongoing and several issues remain unresolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 26, 2024 09:43 AM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/international-geneva/the-outlook-for-international-geneva-in-2025/88619239)\n\n",
