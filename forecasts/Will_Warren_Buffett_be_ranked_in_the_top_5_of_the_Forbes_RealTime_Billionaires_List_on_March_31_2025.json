Veteran investor Howard Marks, who predicted the dot-com crash 25 years ago, is cautioning about high valuations, citing market exuberance, high S&P 500 valuations, ongoing AI hype, reliance on 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, and index investing bias. According to Marks, investors who enter the market when valuations are high consistently earn lower returns over the next 10 years. Marks noted that 'investors clearly shouldn't be indifferent to today's market valuation.' Berkshire Hathaway Inc. holds cash and equivalents worth $325 billion, which may indicate Buffett's concern about high market valuations or preparations for future acquisitions. Tariff tensions and the Federal Reserve's pause on rate cuts are shaping market sentiment, with Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel predicting that the stock market's performance depends on the duration of the tariffs. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Research, pointed out that if the S&P 500 drops below its December low in the first quarter, the full-year return is likely negative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 01:28 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/25/02/43622036/warren-buffett-indicator-tops-205-amid-skyrocketing-sp-500-valuations-as-this-billionaire-dot-com-crash-predictor-sounds-alarm)\n\n**Top 10 Highest-Paid CEOs in 2025: Number 1 is a Billionaire**\nAccording to Nubia Magazine and DigitalDefynd, the top 10 highest-paid CEOs in 2025 have been ranked, with Elon Musk taking the top spot as the world's number one billionaire.
