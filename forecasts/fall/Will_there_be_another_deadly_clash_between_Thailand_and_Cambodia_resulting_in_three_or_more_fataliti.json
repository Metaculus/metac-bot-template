I further assess signaling dynamics, the resilience of any ceasefire arrangements, and both strategic drivers and accident risk, with special attention to scenario-based wargaming and base rates for deadly clashes. My approach emphasizes not just troop dispositions and kinetic exchanges, but also command-and-control discipline and willingness/ability of actors to absorb and retaliate to provocations.",

The proximity to the question's resolution (about 6 weeks left) limits time exposure. The presence of external pressure and diplomatic mechanisms marginally restrains both sides, but the current pattern of tit-for-tat and distrust means the probability of another deadly (3+ fatalities) clash is significantly elevated compared to peaceful border situations.

The window for a major new clash is narrowing as diplomatic engagement intensifies: both sides are now under significant pressure from ASEAN, China, Malaysia, and the US to avoid escalation while the world, and their own populations, are watching for de-escalation. Still, trust is low and both sides are forward-deployed and on alert, and without a robust monitoring or peacekeeping buffer, local miscalculation is possible. Factoring in the unstable truce, the absence of a lasting resolution to the underlying dispute, moral and material incentives on both sides not to escalate, and the very short time to resolution, I assess the risk as non-trivial but well below even odds\u2014though not negligible, given multiple close calls.

While international mediation and elite dialogue still operate, the peace agreement is effectively on ice, monitoring is insufficient, and both publics are primed for blame and retaliation. Historically, the base rate of three or more deaths in a single clash is low after the most violent outbreaks, but today's tensions are high, and the absence of robust stopgaps elevates the risk window. Securitization theory suggests that both leaderships might prefer restraint but are constrained by audience and reputation: an incident could spiral too quickly. With only six weeks left, major actors have clear incentives for peace, but the operational reality at the border \u2013 demonstrated by multiple fatal incidents already this month, and escalation in language/actions \u2013 significantly increases downside risk. Overall, I estimate about a 1-in-3 chance (33%) of another deadly, qualifying military clash in this window, higher than the historic average but below even odds, given the powerful (but fragile) countervailing forces.",

The group deliberation reveals a tightly clustered distribution near the midline, with most operational and diplomatic forecasters\u2014Military Intelligence (40%), ICS/Threat Assessment (37-40%), Liberal Institutionalism (32%), Securitization Theory (33%), Conflict Escalation (55%), and ASEAN Regionalism/Postcolonial (58-62%)\u2014debating only the margin of this elevated-but-not-certain danger. Crucially, the collective critique repeatedly pointed to the historical pattern that after ceasefires and international spotlight, the risk of large, multi-fatality flare-ups, while real, is contained by strong incentives for sub-threshold violence and international face-saving. Many forecasters challenging the 50%+ crowd argued persuasively for a modest but significant risk\u2014not the expectation of disaster. Conversely, the risk is clearly not negligible, as 'control' of escalation remains imperfect, and local forces are prone to miscalculation. Hence, I see no reason to either dramatically raise or lower my probability: the modal forecast (30-40%) is well-supported by both base rates and the current incentive structure. The only potential adjustment would have been a slight downward move, based on repeated reinforcement of the power of restraint, but the continual recurrence of new incidents and sustained operational mismanagement supports caution. I will keep my forecast at 40%.",

Critiques of the higher probabilities (55%+, especially CrisisManagementRiskAnalysisProcedures and SoutheastAsianStudiesPostcolonialBorderDisputeAnalysis) convincingly highlight that while violence is persistent, surpassing the key fatality threshold in the short window is still unlikely given strong incentives for restraint, international pressure, and the historic tendency for violence to subside after intense mediation. The defense of SecurityStudiesSecuritizationTheory and my own forecast, as well as the emphasis on sub-threshold violence, further reinforce this. However, the critiques did highlight a slight bias toward underestimating the effect of tactical miscalculation, and several recent incidents nearly crossed the threshold. In light of that, and in the spirit of updating toward the center of the strong expert cluster (around 33\u201340%), I will slightly raise my probability to 35%, giving more weight to baseline volatility and persistent tactical risk, but still well below a coin-flip.",

Notably, the higher forecasts (above 50%) are consistently critiqued\u2014both by myself and others\u2014for conflating volatility with inevitability. The observed pattern since July is repeated near-misses, not a repeated escalation to qualifying deadly incidents, confirming my original analysis. The 6-week timeframe remains too short for the odds of a 3+ fatality incident to rise much further, unless a major triggering event occurs. Therefore, the most compelling, rationally grounded stance remains at roughly 1-in-3 odds: elevated risk due to tension and breakdowns, but still more likely than not that another qualifying deadly clash does not occur before Jan 1, 2026.",

Several competitors make strong cases, particularly the Security Studies (Securitization Theory), International Relations (Liberal Institutionalism), and Military Intelligence perspectives, that after an initial post-ceasefire spike, historical base rates for multi-fatality incidents generally subside\u2014especially under the heavy gaze of ASEAN, US, and China, as seen now. On the other hand, the critics of very low probabilities rightly emphasize that border-level volatility and command/control problems remain real, and the confidence-building mechanisms are not robust, sustaining some upward risk. The key adjustment is in calibrating more strongly toward historic patterns after intense mediation: very few direct major escalations so quickly post-ceasefire, and nearly all recent violence has been deadly but sub-threshold. Weighing these, I revise my probability slightly downward to reflect the importance of those historical post-mediation risk drops and visible political will on both sides to avoid full-scale incident, but I keep the estimate above the 'elevated risk' band due to persistent operational dangers.",

Multiple experts emphasized that, despite repeated sub-threshold incidents, local actors often face heavy, immediate pressure not to escalate\u2014reinforced by swift diplomatic intervention and economic leverage from the US, China, and ASEAN. In addition, the strong evidence of self-restraint following third-party mediation, alongside the very limited time window remaining (just 6 weeks), moderately weakens the base-rate argument for a qualifying deadly incident, especially given that the last two escalations, while alarming, maxed out at single fatalities per event. While my postcolonial perspective still highlights the genuine risk of a sudden Spark/flashpoint, I now judge the short time period and external pressures to more significantly reduce (though not eliminate) the odds of further deadly escalation.

According to [Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/will-the-cambodia-thailand-ceasefire-hold/a-73448995):\n\n> Matthew Wheeler, a senior analyst for the International Crisis Group in Bangkok, said Monday's truce could take hold \u2014 as long as both sides \"recognize their interests are better served by a ceasefire than further fighting.\"\n\n> He said the deal could hit some snags over the details, though, including how exactly to monitor the ceasefire, which has yet to be worked out in full.\n\n> Malaysia, as ASEAN chair, has offered to coordinate a monitoring team. But Wheeler says neither side is keen to host monitors from other countries.\n\n> \"There was a plan to introduce Indonesian observers under ASEAN auspices after fighting in 2011, but it never happened,\" he said.

The Thai government and military presented evidence of the mine placements during a press conference, with government spokesperson Siripong Angskasakulkiat stating that Thailand will pursue bilateral mechanisms with Cambodia first, but reserves the right to escalate to multilateral measures if needed. He emphasized that Thailand will respond appropriately to provocations. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura confirmed that Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul will send an official letter to U.S. President Donald Trump to reaffirm Thailand's position on suspending the Joint Declaration due to Cambodia's alleged breach. The letter, stemming from prior phone conversations, focuses solely on border security and excludes commercial issues. Balankura expressed hope that international pressure, particularly from the U.S., would prompt Cambodia to comply with its commitments. Trump has acknowledged Thailand\u2019s concerns but has not publicly commented on the crisis. The peace agreement, signed in the presence of the U.S. president, aimed to end hostilities following violent clashes in July that caused over 40 deaths and displaced approximately 300,000 people. Historical tensions between the two nations date back over a century, with the recent July clashes triggered by Thailand\u2019s accusation that Cambodia placed mines along the border\u2014a claim Cambodia denies categorically. The conflict involved gunfire, bombings, and rocket launches, leading to the withdrawal of ambassadors and the closure of border crossings, allowing only the return of Cambodian migrant workers. The October peace deal included joint demining operations, removal of heavy weaponry, and ASEAN-coordinated international observers. Although Cambodia announced the withdrawal of destructive weapons, regional experts warn that without addressing the underlying territorial dispute, peace remains fragile and provisional.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 07:10 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/11/17/tension-entre-tailandia-y-camboya-el-ejercito-tailandes-detecto-nuevas-minas-terrestres-en-la-frontera/)\n\n**Over 800 Cambodian Families Displaced by Border Incident; Cambodia Condemns Thai Forces' Use of Force**\nOver 800 Cambodian families were displaced due to a border incident on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, in the village of Prey Chan, where one person died and three were seriously injured in a shooting by Thai forces. Authorities and donors are providing essential humanitarian aid to hundreds of residents who fled to the Wat Chan Sy Samaky Ratanaram sanctuary. Although no further armed incidents were reported on November 13 and 14, the alert level remains high in Prey Chan and Chouk Chey, according to Cambodia\u2019s national news agency AKP. Banteay Meanchey provincial governor Oum Reatrey stated that 'the Royal Government will not allow any citizen to be in a vulnerable situation during this difficult moment.' On November 15, State Secretary Sophea Eat informed the diplomatic corps and international organizations about the incident, formally protesting the Thai military's use of force and emphasizing that it disrupted ongoing demarcation efforts agreed upon in October. She referenced a prior landmine incident on November 10 near the Preah Vihear temple\u2014historically contaminated since the 1980s war\u2014as a case requiring investigation but cautioned against letting it hinder peace efforts. Sophea Eat reaffirmed Cambodia\u2019s commitment to the July 28 ceasefire agreement and the October 26 Kuala Lumpur Joint Declaration on peaceful dispute resolution. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation condemned the shooting as a 'grave violation of Cambodia\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' a breach of international humanitarian law, and a violation of the UN Charter, ASEAN Charter, and the Southeast Asia Friendship and Cooperation Treaty. The ministry also highlighted Cambodia\u2019s 'maximum moderation' in refraining from retaliation, including after the tragic shooting of civilians, to preserve the fragile truce.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 05:37 AM\nSource:[prensa-latina.cu](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/11/17/mas-de-800-familias-camboyanas-desplazadas-por-incidente-fronterizo/)\n\n**Thai King\u2019s Historic Visit to China Amid Border Tensions with Cambodia**\nOn November 13, 2025, King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand arrived in Beijing, marking the first official state visit by a Thai monarch to China in decades. The visit was met with high-level Chinese hospitality, including a formal welcome ceremony and structured diplomatic talks, signaling the importance of Sino-Thai relations and being described by observers as a 'milestone' in regional diplomacy. However, on November 12, 2025, just one day before the king's arrival, intense gunfire erupted along the Thai-Cambodian border. Cambodia's Ministry of Defense accused Thai forces of opening fire on civilians, injuring five, and violating a ceasefire agreement. Thailand denied the claim, asserting that Cambodian troops initiated a 10-minute artillery exchange targeting a Thai border base, and stated it had maintained restraint despite being prepared to respond. This clash ended a fragile ceasefire that had lasted less than a month. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet swiftly ordered border troops to full alert and deployed reinforcements, reaffirming his hardline stance established during a similar conflict in July 2025. The underlying cause of the conflict is the longstanding, unresolved border dispute spanning over 800 kilometers, with contested territories, resource competition, and historical grievances. The situation intensified after a Thai soldier was injured on November 10 from a mine, which Thailand blamed on Cambodia\u2019s new mine-laying, while Cambodia claimed it was a legacy mine from past conflicts. This incident led Thailand to suspend implementation of the 'Peace Joint Statement' and halt the release of Cambodian prisoners of war, pushing tensions to a breaking point. While some speculated the conflict was orchestrated to disrupt the Thai king\u2019s visit, this theory lacks credible evidence. The Sino-Thai visit, planned since May 2025, aims to strengthen 'family-like' ties and advance cooperation in trade, security, and military domains\u2014evidenced by a May meeting between Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun and Thai Armed Forces Commander Songwit, which confirmed joint military exercises and personnel training. The conflict has deep historical roots and is unrelated to Sino-Thai relations. Thailand\u2019s decision to proceed with the visit despite the crisis underscores its commitment to dialogue and signals to Cambodia that peaceful resolution is possible. China, as a neutral mediator, has previously facilitated de-escalation and continues to play a constructive role. The high-level reception of the Thai king conveys a broader diplomatic message: 'dialogue over confrontation.' This atmosphere pressures both Thailand and Cambodia to de-escalate. Prolonged conflict would harm both nations, disrupting cross-border civilian life and economic development. Thailand seeks a stable neighborhood to support its China-focused cooperation, while Cambodia prioritizes its relationship with Beijing. The Chinese diplomatic gesture is thus both a sign of goodwill and a strategic signal. Ultimately, the coexistence of the king\u2019s visit and the border conflict reflects the complexity of international relations. The most rational path forward is for both sides to return to negotiations, leveraging China\u2019s mediation, to resolve disputes peacefully. The gunfire may be fleeting, but the enduring friendship between Thailand and China remains intact, and regional stability depends on mutual restraint and dialogue.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 03:15 AM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/954713674_121997470?scm=10001.279_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0.a2_5X162X1532)\n\n**Great Power Rivalry Sparks Political, Economic, and Social Tensions in Small States: The Case of Thailand and Cambodia**\nOver the past week, Thailand and Cambodia's peace declaration was ruptured by a border mine explosion, prompting urgent mediation by ASEAN and the United States. King Vajiralongkorn of Thailand made a rare visit to Beijing, highlighting the difficult strategic choices facing small nations amid great power competition. The Taiwan issue reignited tensions between China and Japan, underscoring the high sensitivity of security in the Asia-Pacific region. Analysts\u666e\u904d\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0c\u8d85\u7ea7\u5927\u56fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e92\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e2d\u7f8e\u535a\u5f08\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u77db\u76fe\u65e0\u6cd5\u56e0\u6682\u65f6\u7684\u6b62\u635f\u63aa\u65bd\u800c\u6539\u53d8, and Southeast Asian nations remain inevitably affected. Recent border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia resulted in injuries to two Thai soldiers, prompting Thailand to suspend implementation of a peace agreement. Cambodia denied the allegations and continued calling for the release of 18 Cambodian prisoners. The conflict erupted after the two countries signed the Kuala Lumpur Joint Declaration under the witness of U.S. President Donald Trump and ASEAN Chair Anwar Ibrahim, committing to resolve border disputes through ASEAN mechanisms. Following the renewed violence, ASEAN Chair Anwar Ibrahim initiated mediation, urging adherence to the agreement. He reported positive feedback from both leaders, who reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful resolution. ASEAN welcomed the removal of heavy weapons and destruction of weapons from border areas and coordinated humanitarian demining efforts. U.S. President Trump also engaged in phone diplomacy, stating he participated in efforts to implement the peace agreement, and claimed the two nations 'would be fine.' Reports indicate Trump reportedly requested that Beijing representatives not attend the signing ceremony, which Thailand reportedly respected. The border conflict, rooted in ambiguous colonial-era boundaries drawn by France, centers on the Preah Vihear Temple, which the International Court of Justice ruled in 1962 and reaffirmed in 2013 belonged to Cambodia\u2014though Thailand continues to contest the decision. The ongoing tensions have led to closed trade ports, economic losses, and civilian displacement. ASEAN's mediation has yielded limited progress. Rising nationalism in both countries exacerbates internal social tensions, with Cambodia favoring international court resolution and Thailand preferring bilateral talks. Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow presented a briefing to 59 foreign envoys and four international organizations, asserting that mines were planted after the ceasefire agreement and accusing Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention. Thailand presented four demands: 1) acknowledgment of new mine placement; 2) responsibility for damages; 3) bilateral rules negotiation; and 4) access to 13 border zones for demining. Thai media reported that the U.S. suspended tariff talks until the peace agreement is upheld. Prime Minister Anutin reiterated Thailand\u2019s stance on social media, stating that the agreement would not be resumed without compliance. The Thai Foreign Ministry later revealed that Trump informed Anutin that the U.S. would not intervene bilaterally, and that trade negotiations would continue independently of the border dispute. The U.S. continues to impose a 19% baseline tariff on Thai goods. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet thanked Anwar Ibrahim and Trump for their role in promoting peace and reaffirmed Cambodia\u2019s commitment to the spirit of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration. Thai media expressed disappointment over U.S. pressure, with journalist Suthichai Yoon stating that today\u2019s trade is inherently political, with 'security' casting a shadow over every transaction\u2014a hallmark of Trump-era Realpolitik. In contrast to past idealistic strategies emphasizing democracy and human rights, realism now prevails. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Thailand-China diplomatic ties, King Vajiralongkorn visited China from November 13\u201317, 2025, marking the first visit by a reigning Thai monarch to China. The Thai government stated the visit reflects deep friendship and mutual understanding. President Xi Jinping affirmed China\u2019s willingness to strengthen strategic alignment with Thailand, advance major projects like the China-Thailand Railway, expand imports of high-quality Thai agricultural products, and deepen cooperation in emerging sectors such as AI, digital economy, and aerospace. China has been Thailand\u2019s largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years. In the first half of 2025, bilateral trade reached $76.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year. Thai Prime Minister Anutin revealed on Facebook that China will purchase 500,000 tons of Thai rice under a government-to-government agreement, a key outcome of a bilateral meeting at the APEC summit in Busan. Meanwhile, Thailand maintains over 200 years of traditional ties with the U.S., and its Cold War-era status as a key U.S. strategic ally in Asia remains significant. The King\u2019s visit is widely seen as a strategic diplomatic move. Southeast Asian media have closely monitored the sudden escalation of Sino-Japanese tensions over the Taiwan issue. After Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi stated 'if Taiwan is attacked, Japan will be affected,' China\u2019s Consul General in Osaka, Xue Jian, responded with a 'decapitation theory' and warned Chinese citizens against traveling to Japan. China\u2019s military media reported that the PLA Southern Theater Command conducted bomber patrols over the South China Sea to deter the Philippines\u2019 joint patrols with Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S., accusing Manila of destabilizing regional peace. Beijing urged Manila to cease provocations. The U.S., whose core interests are at stake in Taiwan, has seen Defense Secretary Peter Brian Hegseth reiterate that Washington does not seek conflict but will continue to defend its interests in the region. Hegseth advanced military cooperation with India, Malaysia, and the Philippines during the Kuala Lumpur summit, signaling clear intent toward China. Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong recently warned that rising protectionism, populism, and rapid technological change are exacerbating inequality and internal pressures, fueling political polarization and social fractures\u2014posing a major challenge for nations to prevent. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. faces growing domestic pressure.

The truce, brokered in Kuala Lumpur, aimed to end five days of intense fighting in the summer of 2025 that resulted in 43 deaths and displaced approximately 300,000 people. Fresh clashes erupted on November 13, 2025, in Banteay Meanchey province along the Cambodia-Thailand border, with Phnom Penh reporting the death of a civilian. Thailand suspended the agreement on November 10, 2025, following an alleged landmine blast.

The Thai government and military presented evidence of the mine placements during a press conference, with government spokesperson Siripong Angskasakulkiat stating that Thailand will pursue bilateral mechanisms with Cambodia first, but reserves the right to escalate to multilateral measures if needed. He emphasized that Thailand will respond appropriately to provocations. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura confirmed that Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul will send an official letter to U.S. President Donald Trump to reaffirm Thailand's position on suspending the Joint Declaration due to Cambodia's alleged breach. The letter, stemming from prior phone conversations, focuses solely on border security and excludes commercial issues. Balankura expressed hope that international pressure, particularly from the U.S., would prompt Cambodia to comply with its commitments. Trump has acknowledged Thailand\u2019s concerns but has not publicly commented on the crisis. The peace agreement, signed in the presence of the U.S. president, aimed to end hostilities following violent clashes in July that caused over 40 deaths and displaced approximately 300,000 people. Historical tensions between the two nations date back over a century, with the recent July clashes triggered by Thailand\u2019s accusation that Cambodia placed mines along the border\u2014a claim Cambodia denies categorically. The conflict involved gunfire, bombings, and rocket launches, leading to the withdrawal of ambassadors and the closure of border crossings, allowing only the return of Cambodian migrant workers. The October peace deal included joint demining operations, removal of heavy weaponry, and ASEAN-coordinated international observers. Although Cambodia announced the withdrawal of destructive weapons, regional experts warn that without addressing the underlying territorial dispute, peace remains fragile and provisional.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 07:10 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/11/17/tension-entre-tailandia-y-camboya-el-ejercito-tailandes-detecto-nuevas-minas-terrestres-en-la-frontera/)\n\n**Thailand Suspends 'Peace Declaration' with Cambodia After Border Mine Incident**\nThailand has suspended the implementation of the declaration on conflict resolution with Cambodia, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand. Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakum sent official letters to U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, stating that Thailand is pausing the declaration aimed at de-escalating tensions. The move follows a mine explosion in a border region that killed four Thai soldiers, which Thailand attributed to Cambodia. Authorities claimed the mines were placed on areas recently cleared of landmines, accusing Cambodia of a serious violation of the agreement. As a result, Thailand halted the withdrawal of heavy military equipment from the border and postponed the release of Cambodian prisoners of war. The border conflict intensified in May 2025, leading to full-scale fighting, but a ceasefire was agreed upon in July 2025. In October 2025, the declaration on relations was signed in Kuala Lumpur in the presence of U.S. and Malaysian leaders. The Ministry emphasized that Thailand reserves the right to defend its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national security, with future actions dependent on Cambodia\u2019s conduct.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.Ru // \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd-\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd](https://www.ntv.ru/novosti/2949527/)\n\n**Trump Seeks Credit for Cambodia-Thailand Ceasefire, U.S. Officials Downplay China's Role**\nIn July 2024, a border conflict erupted between Cambodia and Thailand near the disputed Ta Mo Anong Temple, resulting in civilian casualties and mass displacement. The conflict was resolved with a ceasefire agreement signed on August 7, 2024. China played a visible and active role in mediating the conflict, with both Cambodia and Thailand publicly thanking Beijing for its efforts. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi engaged in multiple diplomatic initiatives, including hosting a trilateral informal meeting in Shanghai on July 30, 2024, and organizing a tea talk in Anning, Yunnan, on August 14, 2024, with Cambodian and Thai foreign ministers. Both countries reiterated their commitment to the ceasefire and praised China's constructive role. Despite this, a senior U.S. official claimed on October 24, 2024, that China had 'not played a significant or substantive role' in the peace talks. The U.S. reportedly pressured the organizers of the 47th ASEAN Summit in Malaysia to exclude Chinese officials from the official ceasefire signing ceremony, aiming to center attention on President Donald Trump. Trump sought to leverage the event to promote his image as a 'chief peacemaker' and bolster his bid for the Nobel Peace Prize, which he had openly pursued since returning to office in January 2024. However, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded on October 10, 2024, to Mar\u00eda Corina Machado of Venezuela, and Trump did not receive it.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 10:15 AM\nSource:[guancha.cn](https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2025_10_25_794521.shtml?s=sywglbt)\n\n**Over 800 Cambodian Families Displaced by Border Incident**\nOver 800 Cambodian families have been displaced due to a border incident involving a shooting in the village of Prey Chan on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, which resulted in one death and three serious injuries. Authorities and donors are providing essential humanitarian aid to hundreds of residents who fled to the Wat Chan Sy Samaky Ratanaram sanctuary. Although no further armed incidents were reported on November 13 and 14, the alert level remains high in Prey Chan and Chouk Chey, according to Cambodia\u2019s national news agency AKP. Banteay Meanchey provincial governor Oum Reatrey stated that 'the Royal Government will not allow any citizen to be in a vulnerable situation during this difficult moment.' On November 15, State Secretary Sophea Eat informed diplomatic missions and international organization representatives about the border events. She announced Cambodia\u2019s formal protest against the Thai forces\u2019 shooting on November 12, emphasizing that the illegitimate use of force also disrupted ongoing demarcation efforts agreed upon in October. Sophea referenced a prior landmine incident on November 10 near the Preah Vihear temple\u2014historically contaminated since the 1980s war\u2014calling for investigation but cautioning that it should not hinder peace efforts. She reaffirmed Cambodia\u2019s commitment to the July 28 ceasefire agreement and the Kuala Lumpur Joint Declaration on peaceful dispute resolution, signed on October 26 by the prime ministers of Cambodia and Thailand. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation declared the November 12 shooting a serious violation of Cambodia\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, a breach of international humanitarian law, and a violation of the UN Charter, ASEAN Charter, and the Southeast Asia Friendship and Cooperation Treaty. The statement highlighted Cambodia\u2019s restraint in not retaliating against repeated provocations, including the civilian shooting, to preserve the fragile truce.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 06:05 AM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/11/17/mas-de-800-familias-camboyanas-desplazadas-por-incidente-fronterizo/)\n\n**Thai King\u2019s Historic Visit to China Amid Border Tensions with Cambodia**\nOn November 13, 2025, King Maha Vajiralongkorn of Thailand arrived in Beijing, marking the first official state visit by a Thai monarch to China in decades. The visit was met with high-level Chinese hospitality, including a formal welcome ceremony and structured diplomatic talks, signaling the importance of Sino-Thai relations and being described by observers as a 'milestone' in regional diplomacy. However, on November 12, 2025, just one day before the king's arrival, intense gunfire erupted along the Thai-Cambodian border. Cambodia's Ministry of Defense accused Thai forces of opening fire on civilians, injuring five, and violating a ceasefire agreement. Thailand denied the claim, asserting that Cambodian troops initiated a 10-minute artillery exchange targeting a Thai border base, and stated it had maintained restraint despite being prepared to respond. This clash ended a fragile ceasefire that had lasted less than a month. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet swiftly ordered border troops to full alert and deployed reinforcements, reaffirming his hardline stance established during a similar conflict in July 2025. The underlying cause of the conflict is the longstanding, unresolved border dispute spanning over 800 kilometers, with contested territories, resource competition, and historical grievances. The situation intensified after a Thai soldier was injured on November 10 from a mine, which Thailand blamed on Cambodia\u2019s new mine-laying, while Cambodia claimed it was a legacy mine from past conflicts. This incident led Thailand to suspend implementation of the 'Peace Joint Statement' and halt the release of Cambodian prisoners of war, pushing tensions to a breaking point. While some speculated the conflict was orchestrated to disrupt the Thai king\u2019s visit, this theory lacks credible evidence. The Sino-Thai visit, planned since May 2025, aims to strengthen 'family-like' ties and advance cooperation in trade, security, and military domains\u2014evidenced by a May meeting between Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun and Thai Armed Forces Commander Songwit, which confirmed joint military exercises and personnel training. The conflict has deep historical roots and is unrelated to Sino-Thai relations. Thailand\u2019s decision to proceed with the visit despite the crisis underscores its commitment to dialogue and signals to Cambodia that peaceful resolution is possible. China, as a neutral mediator, has previously facilitated de-escalation and continues to play a constructive role. The high-level reception of the Thai king conveys a broader diplomatic message: 'dialogue over confrontation.' This atmosphere pressures both Thailand and Cambodia to de-escalate. Prolonged conflict would harm both nations, disrupting cross-border civilian life and economic development. Thailand seeks a stable neighborhood to support its China-focused cooperation, while Cambodia prioritizes its relationship with Beijing. The Chinese diplomatic gesture is thus both a sign of goodwill and a strategic signal. Ultimately, the coexistence of the king\u2019s visit and the border conflict reflects the complexity of international relations. The most rational path forward is for both sides to return to negotiations, leveraging China\u2019s mediation, to resolve disputes peacefully. The gunfire may be fleeting, but the enduring friendship between Thailand and China remains intact, and regional stability depends on mutual restraint and dialogue.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 03:15 AM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/954713674_121997470?scm=10001.279_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0.a2_5X162X1532)\n\n**Incoming Asean chair Philippines faces a Thailand-Cambodia 'challenge'**\nThailand announced it was suspending the peace agreement with Cambodia, signed at the 47th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 26, following reports that Cambodia laid new mines along their shared border. This led to injuries of several Thai soldiers, including one who lost a foot. Cambodia denied the allegations, with Prime Minister Hun Manet accusing Thai soldiers of killing a civilian. Despite the escalating tensions, a Thai government spokesman confirmed on Saturday that Bangkok would proceed with talks to finalize a reciprocal trade deal with the United States, stating these negotiations would remain separate from the ongoing border dispute. The incoming ASEAN chair, the Philippines, now faces the challenge of managing this bilateral conflict within the regional framework.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 02:30 AM\nSource:[South China Morning Post](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3332959/philippines-takes-asean-helm-thailand-cambodia-dispute-be-significant-challenge)\n\n**Great Power Rivalry Sparks Political, Economic, and Social Tensions in Small States: The Case of Thailand and Cambodia**\nOver the past week, Thailand and Cambodia's peace declaration was ruptured by a border mine explosion, prompting urgent mediation by ASEAN and the United States. King Vajiralongkorn of Thailand made a rare visit to Beijing, highlighting the difficult strategic choices facing small nations amid great power competition. The Taiwan issue reignited tensions between China and Japan, underscoring the high sensitivity of security in the Asia-Pacific region.

Recent border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia resulted in injuries to two Thai soldiers, prompting Thailand to suspend implementation of a peace agreement. Cambodia denied the allegations and continued calling for the release of 18 Cambodian prisoners. The conflict erupted after the two countries signed the Kuala Lumpur Joint Declaration under the witness of U.S. President Donald Trump and ASEAN Chair Anwar Ibrahim, committing to resolve border disputes through ASEAN mechanisms. Following the renewed violence, ASEAN Chair Anwar Ibrahim initiated mediation, urging adherence to the agreement. He reported positive feedback from both leaders, who reaffirmed their commitment to peaceful resolution. ASEAN welcomed the removal of heavy weapons and destruction of weapons from border areas and coordinated humanitarian demining efforts. U.S. President Trump also engaged in phone diplomacy, stating he participated in efforts to implement the peace agreement, and claimed the two nations 'would be fine.' Reports indicate Trump reportedly requested that Beijing representatives not attend the signing ceremony, which Thailand reportedly respected. The border conflict, rooted in ambiguous colonial-era boundaries drawn by France, centers on the Preah Vihear Temple, which the International Court of Justice ruled in 1962 and reaffirmed in 2013 belonged to Cambodia\u2014though Thailand continues to contest the decision. The ongoing tensions have led to closed trade ports, economic losses, and civilian displacement. ASEAN's mediation has yielded limited progress. Rising nationalism in both countries exacerbates internal social tensions, with Cambodia favoring international court resolution and Thailand preferring bilateral talks. Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow presented a briefing to 59 foreign envoys and four international organizations, asserting that mines were planted after the ceasefire agreement and accusing Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention. Thailand presented four demands: 1) acknowledgment of new mine placement; 2) responsibility for damages; 3) bilateral rules negotiation; and 4) access to 13 border zones for demining. Thai media reported that the U.S. suspended tariff talks until the peace agreement is upheld. Prime Minister Anutin reiterated Thailand\u2019s stance on social media, stating that the agreement would not be resumed without compliance. The Thai Foreign Ministry later revealed that Trump informed Anutin that the U.S. would not intervene bilaterally, and that trade negotiations would continue independently of the border dispute. The U.S. continues to impose a 19% baseline tariff on Thai goods. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet thanked Anwar Ibrahim and Trump for their role in promoting peace and reaffirmed Cambodia\u2019s commitment to the spirit of the Kuala Lumpur Declaration. Thai media expressed disappointment over U.S. pressure, with journalist Suthichai Yoon stating that today\u2019s trade is inherently political, with 'security' casting a shadow over every transaction\u2014a hallmark of Trump-era Realpolitik. In contrast to past idealistic strategies emphasizing democracy and human rights, realism now prevails. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Thailand-China diplomatic ties, King Vajiralongkorn visited China from November 13\u201317, 2025, marking the first visit by a reigning Thai monarch to China. The Thai government stated the visit reflects deep friendship and mutual understanding. President Xi Jinping affirmed China\u2019s willingness to strengthen strategic alignment with Thailand, advance major projects like the China-Thailand Railway, expand imports of high-quality Thai agricultural products, and deepen cooperation in emerging sectors such as AI, digital economy, and aerospace. China has been Thailand\u2019s largest trading partner for 12 consecutive years. In the first half of 2025, bilateral trade reached $76.1 billion, up 17% year-on-year. Thai Prime Minister Anutin revealed on Facebook that China will purchase 500,000 tons of Thai rice under a government-to-government agreement, a key outcome of a bilateral meeting at the APEC summit in Busan. Meanwhile, Thailand maintains over 200 years of traditional ties with the U.S., and its Cold War-era status as a key U.S. strategic ally in Asia remains significant. The King\u2019s visit is widely seen as a strategic diplomatic move. Southeast Asian media have closely monitored the sudden escalation of Sino-Japanese tensions over the Taiwan issue. After Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi stated 'if Taiwan is attacked, Japan will be affected,' China\u2019s Consul General in Osaka, Xue Jian, responded with a 'decapitation theory' and warned Chinese citizens against traveling to Japan. China\u2019s military media reported that the PLA Southern Theater Command conducted bomber patrols over the South China Sea to deter the Philippines\u2019 joint patrols with Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S., accusing Manila of destabilizing regional peace. Beijing urged Manila to cease provocations. The U.S., whose core interests are at stake in Taiwan, has seen Defense Secretary Peter Brian Hegseth reiterate that Washington does not seek conflict but will continue to defend its interests in the region. Hegseth advanced military cooperation with India, Malaysia, and the Philippines during the Kuala Lumpur summit, signaling clear intent toward China. Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong recently warned that rising protectionism, populism, and rapid technological change are exacerbating inequality and internal pressures, fueling political polarization and social fractures\u2014posing a major challenge for nations to prevent. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. faces growing domestic pressure. The Philippine religious group INC held large-scale anti-corruption protests in Manila from November 16\u201318, supported by civil groups nationwide. Amid calls for anti-graft measures and democratic reform, rumors of a military coup by retired generals circulated.

The conflict, which erupted after a landmine blast wounded four Thai soldiers on Monday, saw gunfire exchanged between Thailand\u2019s Sa Kaeo province and Cambodia\u2019s Banteay Meanchey province, lasting about 10 minutes with no Thai casualties. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet condemned the violence as a violation of humanitarian principles and recent peace agreements, sharing images and videos allegedly showing wounded civilians, though AFP could not verify their authenticity. Thai military spokesman Winthai Suvaree claimed Cambodian forces initiated fire into Thai territory, prompting Thai troops to respond with warning shots. Cambodian villagers, including Hul Malis and her husband Thong Kimleang, reported being shot at without provocation, with Malis stating, 'I am so frightened, I am running away now.' The border dispute stems from a century-old disagreement over colonial-era boundaries, with both nations claiming several temples. A truce was established on July 29, 2025, after intervention by former U.S. President Donald Trump, Chinese diplomats, and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who chairs ASEAN.

Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul visited the injured soldiers and the Thai Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nikorndej Balankura stated the incident revealed 'Cambodia's utter lack of sincerity,' demanding an apology, a thorough investigation, and preventive measures.

Wheeler noted the agreement was predictable to fail due to its transactional nature and Thailand\u2019s strong nationalist sentiment, which hinders conciliatory diplomacy.

The suspension followed a landmine blast in Sisaket province that wounded four Thai soldiers, which Thailand accused Cambodia of violating the Ottawa Convention banning anti-personnel mines. The peace pact, signed in Kuala Lumpur on October 26 under the chairmanship of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, aimed to de-escalate a conflict that peaked in July 2024, resulting in at least 43 deaths and the displacement of approximately 300,000 civilians. Under the agreement, both sides were to withdraw heavy weapons from the border, allow ceasefire monitors access, and Thailand was to return 18 captured Cambodian troops.

The border dispute has left at least 35 soldiers and civilians dead and forced the evacuation of 200,000 people in both countries. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington, believes that both sides have achieved most of their objectives and that the truce could hold, despite possible sporadic gunfire. However, the Thai military has accused the Cambodian forces of violating the ceasefire in several areas, which the Cambodian Ministry of Defense has denied. Matthew Wheeler, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group in Bangkok, highlights the lack of clarity on how the ceasefire will be supervised, which could hinder the agreement. Paul Chambers, an analyst at the Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, notes that without third-party supervision, it is difficult for any ceasefire agreement to be effectively implemented. The US has threatened to delay trade negotiations with both countries over tariffs unless they agree to end the clashes. According to Wheeler, the US threats have influenced Thailand's stance, which had previously rejected Malaysia's mediation offer.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/es/se-mantendr%C3%A1-el-alto-el-fuego-entre-camboya-y-tailandia/a-73455958)\n\n**Thailand and Cambodia Engage in Sixth Day of Border Clashes**\nTensions between Thailand and Cambodia continue to escalate, with the two countries engaging in border clashes for the sixth consecutive day, despite an immediate and unconditional ceasefire agreement reached in Malaysia the previous day. According to the Thai army, Cambodia violated the truce on Tuesday, prompting Thailand to respond accordingly. This is the same phrase used on July 24, when both countries' military forces blamed each other for initiating an attack. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet stated on Facebook, 'The front line has calmed down after the ceasefire at midnight.' However, during a meeting in Malaysia with Thailand's interim Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, each side questioned the other's sincerity, as their recent speeches have shown little consistency. The current conflict has resulted in 38 fatalities, dozens of injuries, and the displacement of nearly 300,000 people. The dispute combines unresolved historical issues, as the border was mapped by France in 1907, but still has several undemarcated points, which have led to clashes over the years. The current escalation is one of the bloodiest clashes between the two Southeast Asian neighbors, who have attacked each other this time with fighter jets, artillery, tanks, and infantry. Cambodia has taken the territorial dispute to the International Court of Justice, citing a desire for a peaceful solution based on international law, while Bangkok has advocated for a bilateral agreement. A meeting between the two armies in a disputed border area on May 28 ended in a fight that killed a Cambodian soldier. On July 23, a Thai soldier lost his right leg after stepping on a landmine in a border area in Ubon Ratchathani. International organizations and countries have urged the governments to resolve the issue through dialogue, but it remains to be seen whether the words and actions of both sides will align.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 05:09 AM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/07/29/persisten-desacuerdos-discursivos-entre-tailandia-y-camboya/)\n\n**Thailand and Cambodia Agree to Ceasefire, but Clashes Continue**\nDespite a ceasefire agreement reached on Monday, clashes have reportedly occurred at the border between Thailand and Cambodia. A meeting between military leaders of the two countries has been postponed. The ceasefire, which came into effect at midnight local time, has been broken, according to reports. The Thai army accused the Cambodian troops of violating the ceasefire agreement by launching attacks at several locations. In a statement on X, the Thai military said that 'unrest and armed conflict' had occurred in several areas, to which they had responded accordingly. However, the Cambodian Defense Ministry stated that the border remained calm. The two countries' leaders had agreed on a 'immediate and unconditional' ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia on Monday, following severe clashes that resulted in several deaths. The meeting was attended by representatives from the US and China, with Malaysia hosting the meeting as the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). The planned meeting between military leaders of the two countries was postponed by several hours, with no details on the reason. The conflict between the two neighboring countries has been ongoing for decades. On Thursday, severe clashes broke out along their 800-kilometer-long border, resulting in deaths and injuries on both sides, mainly among civilians. Both sides have accused each other of starting the violence, with the cause of the escalation still unclear. Over 200,000 people were displaced from their homes, but many have since returned to their regions. US President Donald Trump had personally intervened in the escalating conflict, calling for a ceasefire in phone calls with the leaders of both countries. Trump threatened that there would be no trade negotiations regarding his proposed tariffs if fighting continued. He had previously announced that the two countries would be subject to 36% tariffs starting in August. After the meeting in Malaysia, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: 'I have just spoken with the acting Prime Minister of Thailand and the Prime Minister of Cambodia. I am pleased to announce that both countries have reached a ceasefire and peace, thanks to my intervention as President of the United States.' He instructed his team to resume trade talks and added, 'I am proud to be the President of Peace!'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: July 29, 2025 03:33 AM\nSource:[Der Tagesspiegel](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/internationales/meldungen-uber-verstosse-am-morgen-waffenruhe-zwischen-thailand-und-kambodscha-ist-in-kraft-14098913.html)\n\n**Thailand and Cambodia Agree to Ceasefire After Five Days of Border Clashes**\nThailand and Cambodia have agreed to an 'immediate and unconditional' ceasefire, effective from midnight, ending five days of intense border clashes that killed 35 people and forced the evacuation of nearly 300,000 people. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced the agreement as the president of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), after a mediating meeting between the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia, Phumtham Wechayachai and Hun Manet, respectively. Anwar said, 'An immediate and unconditional ceasefire, effective from 24:00 on July 28 (17:00 GMT). This is a vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security.' The Malaysian leader highlighted that the conversations were positive and concluded with a mutual commitment to restore peace and security in the affected border areas. To consolidate the de-escalation, at least two bilateral meetings are scheduled: a meeting on Tuesday between military leaders from both countries and a second meeting planned for August 4. Hun Manet thanked US President Donald Trump's mediation and China's participation as an observer in the conversations. 'Let our bilateral discussions return to normal in our relationship,' the Cambodian leader expressed. Phumtham Wechayachai, acting as interim prime minister due to Paetongtarn Shinawatra's suspension, thanked the mediation and highlighted the agreement as 'a peaceful resolution to protect sovereignty and human life.' The clashes began on July 24 after weeks of increasing border tensions. Both armies accused each other of initiating the attacks, which involved heavy artillery including F-16 fighter jets and BM-21 rockets. The conflict left a toll of 35 deaths: 22 from the Thai side (14 civilians and 8 soldiers) and 13 from the Cambodian side (8 civilians and 5 military personnel). Additionally, dozens of people were injured and approximately 291,000 displaced, with over 156,000 in Thailand and around 135,000 in Cambodia. The humanitarian crisis generated by the clashes forced the authorities of both countries to establish massive evacuation centers to protect trapped civilians in the conflict zone. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres celebrated the ceasefire as 'a positive step' towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 28, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[Noticias SIN](https://noticiassin.com/tailandia-y-camboya-acuerdan-cese-al-fuego-tras-cinco-dias-de-combates-fronterizos-que-dejaron-35-muertos-1895153/)\n\n**Malaysia Facilitates Ceasefire Between Thailand and Cambodia**\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar, after the ceasefire talks, announced that the parties had agreed on an 'urgent and unconditional' ceasefire to take effect at midnight local time. According to The Star, Anwar announced that the Thai and Cambodian officials will host the General Border Committee (GBC) meeting on August 4 in Cambodia. Anwar stated that Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia will develop a three-party mechanism to implement the ceasefire, saying that it will 'form the foundation of sustainable peace and accountability.' Anwar emphasized the importance of the Kuala Lumpur meeting, stating that it reaffirmed Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand's joint commitment to finding a fair and lasting solution to the conflict through international law, peaceful coexistence, and multilateral cooperation. Anwar also announced that Malaysia will consult with ASEAN member countries on 'supporting peace in place.' He highlighted that the ceasefire is a vital first step in reducing tensions and restoring peace and security. Anwar emphasized that Malaysia is ready to coordinate the observation team to ensure the implementation of the ceasefire. The ceasefire talks were attended by officials from the US and China. Thailand and Cambodia have been experiencing a long-standing border dispute, with a recent conflict on May 28, resulting in a short-lived clash. The two countries' armies agreed to resolve the issue peacefully. However, a recent conflict on July 24 resulted in the loss of 32 lives from both sides. US President Trump announced on his Truth Social account that he had spoken with the parties and that they had agreed to work towards a ceasefire and ultimately peace. Despite Trump's announcement, the clashes continued.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: July 28, 2025 11:34 AM\nSource:[D\u00fcnya](https://www.dunya.com/dunya/tayland-ve-kambocya-malezya-arabuluculugunda-ateskes-karari-aldi-haberi-787090)\n\n**ASEAN Under Pressure: Malaysia Pushes for Ceasefire as Deadly Thai\u2013Cambodian Border Crisis Deepens**\nOngoing fighting between Thailand and Cambodia has resulted in over 30 deaths and displaced more than 200,000 residents. Malaysia, as ASEAN chair, is promoting an immediate ceasefire and offering mediation. Thailand insists on bilateral talks, while Cambodia has agreed to discuss a ceasefire. The conflict is rooted in territorial disputes and cultural sensitivities. Both countries have accused each other of violating international law and targeting civilians. ASEAN has offered to host talks and broker a ceasefire, but both sides remain entrenched. Analysts warn that without conciliation, the situation could lead to prolonged instability. Regional actors, including China and ASEAN, are urging restraint and dialogue. 'The situation remains volatile, and much now hinges on whether ASEAN-brokered diplomacy can overcome the mutual distrust that has long plagued this disputed border,' said a statement. 'ExpatGo welcomes and encourages comments, input, and divergent opinions, but kindly requests that you use suitable language and refrain from personal attacks or hate speech.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 27, 2025 06:21 AM\nSource:[expatgo.com](https://www.expatgo.com/my/2025/07/27/asean-under-pressure-malaysia-pushes-for-ceasefire-as-deadly-thai-cambodian-border-crisis-deepens/)\n\n",

    "summary": "The panel of forecasting experts assesses the risk of another deadly clash (3+ fatalities) between Thailand and Cambodia before January 1, 2026, as significantly elevated but not a certainty. Nearly all experts emphasize (1) a fragile ceasefire, frequent violations, and a history of volatility along the border, with recent incidents (mine blasts, shootings) nearly reaching the fatal threshold, and (2) strong international pressure for restraint, especially from ASEAN, China, the US, and Malaysia, acting as a deterrent against large-scale escalation. \n\nKey increasing factors include: lack of robust third-party monitoring/verification, entrenched nationalist sentiment and domestic political pressures on both sides, and the historical pattern in which even post-ceasefire, sudden escalation remains plausible\u2014especially given recent suspensions of peace agreements and prisoner stalemates. Lowering factors include: economic and political costs of renewed hostilities, robust (if sometimes ad hoc) diplomatic channels, and the short (6-week) window remaining for the question to resolve, giving less time for a qualifying incident to occur. While several experts see the greatest risk in accidental escalation by local commanders amid mutual mistrust, most believe the risk is somewhat offset by leaders' rational calculus, economic interdependence, and regional/international engagement.\n\nProbabilities estimated by experts range from a low of 25% to a high of 63%, with a cluster of forecasts just above and just below even odds (40%, 40%, 32%, 33%, 37%, 55%, 58%, 62%, 63%). The average forecast from these analyses is approximately 48%. In summary, while no expert sees major war as imminent, the consensus is that the chances of another deadly clash before year's end are notably higher than 'normal' peacetime and above historical averages for post-ceasefire periods, but remain short of a majority likelihood, mainly due to ongoing international restraint efforts and the limited time remaining.",
