            "final_reasoning": "Given the strong base rate\u2014no evidence of any lab outside OpenAI or Anthropic submitting to METR for pre-release catastrophic risk evaluation\u2014the status quo heavily favors a No outcome. C3.ai\u2019s strategic focus on enterprise AI, rather than on the most powerful general-purpose models, further reduces the likelihood that it would seek METR\u2019s services, which are limited and highly selective. The recent surge in regulatory attention and public scandals has not visibly changed the pattern of METR evaluations; they remain the exception, not the norm, and C3.ai does not figure in relevant reporting. Absent a late-breaking, high-profile C3.ai model or surprise regulatory requirement, the probability that C3.ai will have a model evaluated by METR before 2026 is very low. My estimate is slightly above zero only to account for the possibility of a last-minute, under-reported evaluation or a sudden shift in regulatory or industry practice, but there is no positive evidence for such an event.",

Product liability law incentivizes robust safety testing, especially for products with potential to cause catastrophic harm. Knowing the legal drivers, deterrents, and industry responses to liability exposure helps assess whether C3.ai is likely to submit models for independent dangerous behavior evaluation before commercial deployment.",
            "status_quo": "The status quo is that only OpenAI and Anthropic have had models evaluated by METR for catastrophic risk.

As leading labs like OpenAI and Anthropic publicly undergo METR evaluations, there is some pressure for peers to follow, especially for reputational and business-partner reasons. However, the race for speed and market share means many labs still deprioritize rigorous independent evaluation."

Their main business is enterprise AI applications (e.g., predictive maintenance, energy grid optimization), which are less likely to be flagged for existential risk or catastrophic misuse compared to general-purpose LLMs. This reduces internal incentives for METR-style evaluation."

The company relies on internal testing, consistent with current industry norms for non-frontier labs.",

The recent news does not suggest any shift in C3.ai\u2019s risk profile, business model, or external pressure that would make METR evaluation likely. Product liability incentives are present but not urgent, as C3.ai\u2019s products do not (yet) present the same catastrophic misuse risks as LLMs like GPT-5. There is no evidence of public scandal or regulatory action targeting C3.ai that would induce a change in practice. Given these factors\u2014and the clear requirement that only independent METR (or equivalent) evaluation counts for resolution\u2014the most likely outcome is that C3.ai will not have a model evaluated for dangerous behavior by METR before 2026.",
