The technical means, while not absent, are under tight international monitoring, and the risks of losing Western support would be existential for Ukraine. The current news cycle is focused on intense diplomacy, intermittent battlefield developments, and Western debates over security guarantees, with no suggestions that Ukraine is moving toward nuclearization. The base rate for states launching new nuclear weapons programs under international scrutiny, amid war, with such dependency on Western aid, is extremely low. The short time remaining before the question resolves further reduces the already slim probability. Therefore, the likelihood that credible reports will emerge of Ukraine launching a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is extremely low.",
