International consensus\u2014anchored by the Trump peace plan and regional actors\u2014opposes direct Israeli rule, favoring an international or Palestinian transitional administration. The practical and diplomatic costs for Israel would be severe, risking even greater isolation, sanctions, and potential legal jeopardy. Although right-wing Israeli politicians agitate for more control, and fragmentation on the Palestinian side creates a tempting power vacuum, the net effect of international, regional, and US pressure, plus the operational burdens involved, make the scenario extremely unlikely.

Even in moments of maximal Israeli military dominance, Israel has avoided the legal and diplomatic consequences of formal annexation or civil/military government in Gaza, due to the risk of demographic absorption, international isolation, and perpetual insurgency. The current news confirms: (1) robust international and regional engagement to prevent Israeli rule, (2) even right-wing Israeli governments face overwhelming constraints, (3) the operational reality in Gaza is catastrophic and unmanageable, (4) the base rate of such Israeli moves is extremely low. The only plausible pathway is a total collapse of all alternatives, combined with a dramatic new existential crisis for Israel\u2014an unlikely but not impossible scenario. Therefore, the probability of Israel formally establishing governmental control of the Gaza Strip in 2025 is very low, but not quite zero, given the volatility of the region.",

The Trump peace plan, current ceasefire terms, and ongoing diplomatic activity all exclude Israeli government or annexation scenarios. Legally, the costs of formal annexation or civil government are prohibitive, especially with ICC/ICJ proceedings ongoing. Even within Israel, apart from fringe coalition elements, there is little appetite for the enormous burden and international fallout of direct rule. The only plausible 'Yes' scenario would require a dramatic and sudden breakdown of current diplomatic efforts, a major security crisis, or a far-right political coup\u2014none of which are signaled by present news or historical precedent. The base rate for such formal moves is extremely low post-1967.

Even if Israeli military actions persist, there is no formal cabinet, council, or annexation decree extended over 50%+ of Gaza. International pressure and the threat of isolation deter Israel from crossing this line.",
            "yes_scenario": "A catastrophic breakdown occurs: the international peace plan collapses, the stabilization force never deploys, and renewed large-scale attacks from Gaza (or a major incident involving hostages or cross-border violence) prompt Israel to unilaterally announce the establishment of a 'provisional government' or annexation decree over significant parts of Gaza. The Israeli cabinet formally establishes a governance council or similar entity, led by Israeli citizens, with jurisdiction over more than half of Gaza, and this is reported in major international media. Alternatively, the Knesset votes to annex at least 50% of Gaza outright. This would come at enormous diplomatic cost and would likely trigger major regional instability.",

The base rate for Israel converting military control into formal government under high international scrutiny is extremely low. All major actors\u2014Arab states, Turkey, the U.S. (even under Trump), the EU, and the UN\u2014are united in opposing such a move, and the Israeli government itself is deeply divided and lacks a feasible administrative plan for direct rule. While ongoing violence, breakdowns in the peace plan, and the possibility of renewed hostilities could prompt more aggressive Israeli actions, these are unlikely to translate into a formal, announced, and internationally recognizable government or annexation per the resolution criteria. The most likely outcome is continued de facto military control in some areas, not a formal government. Therefore, the probability of Israel establishing direct governmental control of the Gaza Strip in 2025 is very low, though not absolutely zero given the volatility. I estimate the probability at 4%.",
