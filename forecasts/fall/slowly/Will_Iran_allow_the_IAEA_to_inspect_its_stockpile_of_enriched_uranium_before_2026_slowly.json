The rapid collapse of the September Cairo agreement, the dynamic of tit-for-tat escalation (sanctions, rhetoric, and military threats), and the recurring Iranian insistence on sovereignty and non-negotiation under pressure all point toward a sustained standoff at least through the end of 2025. The technical difficulty of accessing uranium 'under rubble' provides a plausible pretext for delay, even if the regime were inclined to cooperate. The base rate for Iran rapidly resuming IAEA inspections after military conflict and under heightened sanctions pressure is extremely low, especially within such a short window (less than two months). While I acknowledge a small possibility (on the order of 10-15%) that a crisis\u2014such as a credible threat of renewed airstrikes or a last-minute diplomatic initiative\u2014forces a grudging, face-saving Iranian announcement, the overwhelming likelihood is that no such agreement will be made public before the deadline.",

The narrative of victimhood and sovereignty is ascendant, and the snapback sanctions have further eroded trust. However, two factors nudge the probability upward: (1) credible threats of further Israeli/US strikes if ambiguity persists, and (2) the possibility of a symbolic, partial deal mediated by non-Western actors, allowing Iran to claim a diplomatic victory while offering minimal compliance. The window to 2026 is very short, making a major shift unlikely unless a credible threat or incentive emerges in the next six weeks. On balance, while a last-minute, face-saving deal is not impossible, the status quo is likely to prevail.

Technical and security pretexts are used to justify delays, while Iran demands sanctions relief and security guarantees not forthcoming in time. No new comprehensive deal is reached; minor diplomatic contacts fail to yield breakthrough.",

Under a carefully worded deal (possibly brokered by China or Russia), Iran announces resumption of inspections before January 1, 2026\u2014though possibly with restrictions or staged implementation.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for Iran granting IAEA access under high tension is low, especially without a broader deal. The recent cycle of war, mutual distrust, and parliamentary moves to suspend cooperation all reinforce the status quo of opacity. While there is international pressure and the risk of renewed strikes, Iran has shown a willingness to absorb economic and military costs for strategic leverage, and technical obstacles provide plausible reasons for delay. Unless there is a rapid, unexpected diplomatic breakthrough\u2014unlikely given the short timeline and current hardline posture\u2014the probability of Iran allowing IAEA inspections before 2026 is low, though not zero, given the possibility of a crisis-forcing move. On balance, I assess the chance at 18%.",
