The PAIGC's endorsement of Fernando Dias cannot compensate for the lack of party ballot access and the demoralization or abstention likely among its base. Comparative experience in similar African polities with manipulated elections and opposition exclusion (e.g., Tanzania, Rwanda, Cameroon) shows the incumbent wins in nearly all such cases, regardless of international criticism or local protests. While Guinea-Bissau's coup-prone history means some residual risk of an exogenous shock, the probability of a regime-accepted loss is exceedingly low under the present configuration. The only caveat is that extreme instability or a last-minute elite split (e.g., within the military or presidential coalition) could theoretically derail the process, but there is little current evidence for this. Thus, the probability of Embal\u00f3 being re-elected is extremely high.",
