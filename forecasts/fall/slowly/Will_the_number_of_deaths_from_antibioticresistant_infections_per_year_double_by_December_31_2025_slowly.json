Recent news articles and global data confirm that AMR mortality is a worsening global threat, but the US-specific figures show steady, not exponential, growth. Even the most concerning UK reports show a 17% increase year-over-year, and the US has not reported a similar pattern. The time remaining (1.5 months) is extremely short for such a substantial revision or event to occur. The most likely scenario is continued incremental increases, not a sudden doubling. While a methodological change could in theory produce such a revision, there is no indication this is imminent. Given all evidence, the probability that a credible source will report 70,000 or more US AMR deaths annually by the end of 2025 is extremely low.",
