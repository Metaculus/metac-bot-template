Furthermore, no relevant draft law has even been introduced, and the Verkhovna Rada is currently prioritizing other mobilization adjustments. The extension of martial law and mobilization through February 2026 also signals a preference for stability in current conscription rules. While ongoing military losses could force a last-minute shift, the time horizon is now extremely short, and the political costs of lowering the age to below 25 are high.

The government has prioritized alternative measures (deferments, incentives, reserving key workers, contract service, and potentially mobilizing women with medical training). Given the status quo bias, bureaucratic timelines, and the lack of a formal bill as of mid-October, it is highly unlikely Ukraine will officially reduce the minimum age for compulsory military service before January 1, 2026, unless there is a sharp, unexpected escalation. The base rate for such a rapid, late-year, politically sensitive military policy change is very low, especially in a democracy at war, where legitimacy and social cohesion are paramount. I therefore assign a low probability, but do not go to zero due to the possibility of a sudden emergency.",
