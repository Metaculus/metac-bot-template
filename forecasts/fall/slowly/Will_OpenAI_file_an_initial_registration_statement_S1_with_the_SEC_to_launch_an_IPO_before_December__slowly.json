The groundwork for a future IPO is being laid (via restructuring and discussions), but timelines from both management and credible media reports consistently target late 2026 at the earliest for any kind of filing, and more likely 2027 for an IPO event. As an investment banking expert, I know that for mega-IPOs, the confidential filing and preparation phase is lengthy and typically not rushed, especially in a company navigating regulatory, corporate governance, and market education complexities at OpenAI\u2019s scale. There is no evidence of acceleration, and all signals indicate a deliberate pace. The base rate for major tech companies of this scale reversing such clear public guidance and accelerating to a public S-1 within a year is exceedingly low.
