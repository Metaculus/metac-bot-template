The opposition is mobilized but lacks the capacity for armed insurrection or to penetrate the security elite. The recent wave of coups in West and Central Africa marginally raises risk via contagion, but Cameroon\u2019s regime characteristics (deep institutionalization, absence of strong military opposition, and history of regime survival) align more with coup-resistant cases. Given the short time left until the question resolves (about six weeks), the window for a coup is closing rapidly unless a major shock occurs. The base rate for coups in similar entrenched African regimes is <2% per year, and the structural context in Cameroon does not suggest an imminent breakdown.

While the regional coup trend is notable, Cameroon\u2019s internal regime mechanics, elite management, and coup-proofing remain robust. The advanced age and potential health issues of Biya do introduce some risk of a succession crisis, which could be an opening for a coup, but such transitions usually require longer lead times, signs of elite jockeying, or leaks of military plotting, none of which are present in current reporting.

The news shows severe repression, elite split (Bakary), and public unrest, but no direct evidence of military dissent or coup plotting. Biya\u2019s advanced age and the volatile post-election context marginally raise coup risk, especially if he were incapacitated, but there is no indication of imminent military intervention. The regime, for now, appears to have contained unrest and preserved elite/military cohesion. With only about 1.5 months left, the window for a successful coup is closing.

There is no sign of elite splits or mutiny\u2014Biya's system of patronage and careful management of the security apparatus appears intact, and the violent crackdown demonstrates regime capacity. The regional coup wave and Biya's advanced age do elevate risk above the background rate, as do succession uncertainties. However, with only about 1.5 months left in the forecast window and no sign of an imminent rupture in elite cohesion, the probability remains low, though not negligible. I adjust slightly upward from the historical base rate (which would be around 2-3%) to account for regional contagion and Biya's age, but the overall chance remains in the single digits.",
