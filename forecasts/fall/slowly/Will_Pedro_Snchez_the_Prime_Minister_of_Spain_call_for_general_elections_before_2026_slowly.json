Polling data is not currently available in this prompt, but unless PSOE\u2019s position collapses or a new scandal explodes, the incentives still tilt toward survival. Historically, Spanish PMs have not called early elections under pressure unless governance is truly impossible (see Rajoy 2016, S\u00e1nchez himself in 2019). The unresolved question is whether current scandals will escalate or the parliamentary blockade will become absolute. Both are possible, but not (yet) inevitable. Therefore, while the base rate for snap elections in Spain is low, current conditions justify a significant upward adjustment, but not to majority odds.

However, the POS is highly volatile: the loss of a parliamentary majority, intensifying corruption scandals involving not just party figures but S\u00e1nchez\u2019s family, and open internal dissent signal a structurally weakened government. Historically, Spanish governments have sometimes survived similar storms, but the current combination of gridlock, judicial escalation, and elite fragmentation raises the risk. Still, the window is tight: only about 1 year left, and the bar for dissolution is high. No definitive trigger (like an impending budget defeat, mass resignation, or formal loss of investiture) is yet visible in the news, though the situation is evolving. Balancing the strong status quo bias with these unusually high risk factors, I estimate the probability of early elections being called before 2026 at 30%. This is notably above the base rate (which is likely closer to 10-15%), but not yet high enough to expect a snap election as the likeliest scenario.",
