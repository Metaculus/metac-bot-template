Operationally, Russia\u2019s advances, while measurable, remain attritional and slow\u2014averaging less than 500 km\u00b2 per month in the best recent periods, with urban assaults (Avdiivka, Chasiv Yar) taking months even for small cities. The capture of a city like Zaporizhzhia or Kharkiv is several orders of magnitude more difficult than taking smaller towns, especially with Ukraine\u2019s continued ability to reinforce critical nodes. Winter weather, Ukrainian defensive focus, and the lack of overwhelming Russian superiority all make such operational breakthroughs highly unlikely in the next seven weeks. The only plausible Yes scenario is a sudden Ukrainian collapse, which lacks evidence in current reporting. Therefore, the base rate for the fall of large urban centers in such a short timeframe is extremely low. I assign a very low (but not zero) probability.",

The frontline remains highly contested, with Ukraine prioritizing defense of the key cities required for question resolution (Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Odesa, etc.). Russian resource constraints and the absence of any major breakthroughs, plus the lack of evidence for imminent Ukrainian collapse, make it extremely unlikely that Russia will control two or more of the listed additional cities (even Zaporizhzhia city, which is closest, is not under immediate threat of encirclement or direct assault). Eurasianist ideology motivates Russia to sustain the war, but does not overcome fundamental military limitations.
