Recent statements from Secretary Rollins repeatedly stress safety and the impossibility of 'compromising the herd.' The historical base rate for rapid SPS border reopening after pest/disease outbreaks is low, particularly when new cases have occurred as recently as September/October and with high political/media salience. The most likely scenario is that the USDA will require a longer period of clean surveillance data before shifting policy, even if this means enduring high beef prices and trade friction for a few more weeks. The path to a 'Yes' is not impossible\u2014if new surveillance data is exceptionally positive, and if economic/political pressure becomes overwhelming, there could be a late-December partial reopening, but this is a lower-probability, edge-case scenario.

            "final_reasoning": "The recent opening of the Tampico facility and transition to aerial dispersal represent real progress and a good-faith effort by Mexico and the US. There have been no new northern cases since early October, and both governments are highly motivated to resume trade for economic and political reasons. However, the USDA and Trump administration have publicly prioritized 'complete confidence' and are acutely aware of the catastrophic risk of a US screwworm outbreak, with the last ban briefly lifted in July only to be reimposed days later after a new case. Bureaucratic caution and the need for a longer disease-free interval are major hurdles, and there is no indication in official statements of an imminent reopening. Historically, such bans tend to last months after the last detected case near the border. The practical timeline to verify containment, process paperwork, and restart inspections makes reopening before January 1, 2026, unlikely but not impossible\u2014especially if there is political intervention or if a staged/partial reopening is judged sufficient for resolution. Weighing all factors, I assess the probability of reopening before 2026 as low but nonzero.",
