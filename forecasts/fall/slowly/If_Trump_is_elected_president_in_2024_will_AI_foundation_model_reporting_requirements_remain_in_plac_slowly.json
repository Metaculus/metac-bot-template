Multiple news sources (including Buck Sexton's claims and mainstream coverage) state EO 14110 was revoked, and that the administration has replaced it with a deregulatory, innovation-accelerating framework. The new 'Manhattan II' and 'AI Action Plan' initiatives focus on infrastructure, export controls, and national security through technological supremacy\u2014not through model-level reporting or safety requirements. There is no evidence in the news corpus or public record that Trump, by late 2025, has reintroduced any binding reporting requirements that meet or exceed EO 14110's standard. In fact, the administration is repeatedly described as rolling back regulatory barriers and red tape. While there is always a slim chance that a catastrophic event (e.g., major AI misuse or a bipartisan Congressional intervention) could force a reversal, there is no sign of such a scenario as of November 2025. The base rate for sustained regulatory rollback under ideologically motivated administrations is high once key executive orders are revoked, and the lack of statutory or entrenched agency regulation further reduces the likelihood of persistence. Even accounting for APA inertia, the original requirements were not deeply embedded in final agency rules but were primarily executive in nature, making reversal swift and durable. I therefore assess the probability that the reporting requirements (as defined) remain in place at the end of 2025 as extremely low.",

While national security concerns could, in theory, motivate some reporting, the administration\u2019s approach is to avoid burdensome requirements and instead focus on industrial policy, export controls, and voluntary or narrow reporting. There is no sign of Congressional action to reimpose these requirements, and the legal pathway for Trump to repeal the EO is clear. The only real path to a 'Yes' outcome would be an unexpected and severe AI-related crisis prompting new, robust reporting rules at the specified threshold, but nothing in the news or current policy trajectory points to this. While some minimal reporting (e.g., for export controls or national security) may exist, it is highly unlikely to meet the scope and technical thresholds detailed in the resolution criteria.

There is no credible sign of a countervailing movement within the executive branch or Congress to reinstate these requirements at the federal level by end of 2025. National security concerns about AI-enabled CBRN threats are acknowledged, but the administration is pursuing alternative strategies (export controls, infrastructure investment, voluntary standards) rather than mandatory reporting. The only plausible path to a 'Yes' is a sudden and severe crisis forcing bipartisan congressional action in the next two months, but there is no evidence such a shift is underway. Given the short timeline to resolution, the strong deregulatory momentum, and the absence of institutional counterweights, the base rate for regulatory rollback under a unified executive is high.

Industry and agency alignment is toward minimal guardrails, and there is no Congressional action on this front.
