The judiciary has shown itself willing to intervene, and the Supreme Court is actively reviewing related issues. The Pentagon and senior military leadership are likely to resist orders they view as outside legal or constitutional bounds, and the broader civil-military norm remains strong, especially after the 2020 experience. The current unrest, while politically charged, has not escalated to a level comparable to the 1992 LA riots or 1960s civil rights crises that triggered past invocations. However, the risk is not zero: Trump\u2019s rhetoric is escalating, and he could attempt to formally invoke the Act if a sufficiently grave incident occurs, or if he concludes that legal and institutional resistance can be overcome by political fiat. Nevertheless, barring a major, unforeseen crisis between now and January 1, 2026, the most probable scenario is continued threats and brinkmanship, not formal invocation.
