The only credible recent counterexample is the VW diesel scandal, where two former executives reportedly received prison sentences in May 2025. However, given the lack of explicit reporting on whether these individuals\u2019 sentences have begun (and if they are 'senior executives' per filing definitions), plus the likelihood of appeals and suspended sentences (a common outcome in German white-collar cases), the probability of positive resolution is low. Additional ongoing cases are unlikely to resolve fully (conviction, appeals, imprisonment) in the remaining weeks of 2025. Therefore, the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is low but not zero, reflecting a slight risk that a qualifying individual from VW or another case started a prison sentence in the eligible window.

VW was a DAX40 component in 2021, so it meets index criteria. If at least one of these executives (who must have been named on regulatory filings) began serving their prison sentence in 2025, the question resolves Yes. There is ambiguity in the news as to whether their sentences have begun (immediate imprisonment vs. appeal in liberty), but the language ('received prison sentences' vs. 'suspended sentences') and recent German practice suggest at least some were imprisoned without full suspension pending appeal. Thus, despite the strong status quo bias, the specific VW development pushes the probability just above 50%.

Given the news that at least two former VW executives did receive prison terms in May 2025 and the trial was high-profile and seems to meet the criteria, there is a plausible path to a YES resolution, but uncertainty remains about the exact status of those individuals (C-suite/board-level) and whether their sentences commenced within the window.
