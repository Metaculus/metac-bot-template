X's MAU is estimated to have stagnated or declined, with March 2024 estimates at 550 million and subsequent reports of ongoing user and advertiser losses. Threads' integration with Instagram's 3 billion MAU and Meta's demonstrated ability to drive cross-platform adoption are powerful tailwinds. The only plausible barriers are: (1) the precision and public nature of MAU reporting at the end of 2025, and (2) potential ambiguities in X's MAU estimates, especially if X ceases regular reporting. However, given the volume and consistency of independent data (Similarweb, Fast Company, Forbes, and Meta earnings calls), and the fact that Meta is incentivized to announce the milestone, it is highly probable that, before year-end, Meta will publicly confirm Threads' MAU as exceeding the best available public estimate for X. The base rate for such platform overtaking events, when supported by a large incumbent (Meta) and clear signals of declining incumbent (X), is high. Taking into account the small but real risk of reporting ambiguity or last-minute reversal, I assign a probability of 93%.",

X has experienced a persistent decline in both DAUs and MAUs, with advertising revenue also shrinking. While some X-reported MAU figures are suspiciously high (claims of 6B MAU are likely inflated or based on a different definition), the most credible third-party estimates put X's MAU at 500-550M as of early 2024, likely lower now due to continued declines. Threads' DAU:MAU ratio is rising, and Meta's strategic integration with Instagram gives Threads a unique growth engine. The main uncertainty is whether Meta will publicly report a Threads MAU above X's before the deadline. Given the competitive rivalry, Meta's focus on transparency, and the likelihood of crossing the threshold (if it hasn't already), the probability is high.

X continues to decline in both web and mobile engagement, with DAU and MAU both falling year-over-year.
