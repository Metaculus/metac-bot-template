Israel and the US have both shown restraint against direct action targeting Khamenei himself, and the US vetoed assassination proposals. Khamenei\u2019s advanced age does increase risk modestly, but there are no credible health rumors or evidence of decline. The base rate for Supreme Leader turnover in any given year (outside of natural death/infirmity) is extremely low.

External actors (Israel/US) have shown both capability and intent, but U.S. veto power and Israeli caution appear to have stayed their hand for now. The regime has also weathered major shocks in the past without leadership transition. Given only 41 days remain in 2025, the actuarial risk of sudden natural death is non-trivial but not high enough to outweigh the strong authoritarian status quo bias. While the probability is elevated compared to a typical year due to extreme events, it remains more likely than not that Khamenei will survive as Supreme Leader through the end of 2025.",

Assigning a probability just above the actuarial risk of death, plus a modest adjustment for recent instability and assassination risk, gives a final estimate of 7%.",
