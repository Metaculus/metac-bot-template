Operationally, the US withdrawal from Niger and the lack of forward presence in West Africa make rapid kinetic action highly challenging. Additionally, Nigeria is not a failed state and has signaled openness to US support short of direct attacks, making it even less likely the US would risk diplomatic blowback. The only plausible path to a direct strike is a high-profile event forcing the US hand, but the time window is short (6 weeks), and there has been no indication of imminent escalation or preparation for such an operation.

The operational and diplomatic obstacles to a US attack in Nigeria are formidable: lack of proximate bases, risk of backlash, danger of quagmire, and strong resistance from the international community and Nigeria itself. While Trump's rhetoric is unusually escalatory and there is a slim chance of a one-off drone strike or SOF raid if a clear, high-value terrorist target emerges (especially if there is a catalyzing event), the most likely outcome is continued pressure short of kinetic force. The Pentagon's own contingency plans reportedly stop short of recommending direct strikes, and the Nigerian government is signaling willingness to cooperate to avoid escalation.

Nigeria's government and regional organizations are strongly opposed to foreign intervention. Trump's historical pattern (and that of the U.S. more generally) is to issue strong threats for signaling and domestic political consumption without following through except in cases of direct U.S. interests or clear, actionable intelligence tied to imminent mass-casualty plots. The only plausible pathway to a 'Yes' is a highly visible atrocity occurring in the next six weeks that triggers an emotionally driven, limited strike, most likely via drone. However, the lack of U.S. forward basing and the short timeline make even this scenario a long shot. Overall, the status quo is heavily favored. Given these considerations, but acknowledging a small but higher-than-usual risk due to Trump's rhetoric and the deteriorating security situation, I assess the probability of the U.S. conducting a military attack within Nigeria before January 1, 2026, as 7%.",

The Pentagon and key advisors are skeptical of efficacy, and the logistical hurdles after the US withdrawal from Niger are substantial. Nigerian and African Union resistance, as well as high risk of civilian casualties and quagmire, further reduce probability. Trump's pattern of maximalist threats followed by inaction (e.g., Iran, Venezuela) is notable.
