Most unrest remains geographically and socially contained, and the security forces, while politicized, have not yet fractured or shown signs of mutiny. The high trauma and depoliticization of the population, combined with the lack of a clear trigger event since Duterte's detention (no mass uprising or military rebellion), suggests that the status quo will likely hold through the end of 2025. The greatest risk lies in Mindanao, where martial law could be declared if violence surges; however, absent a dramatic new event, this remains less likely than stability.

The Philippines\u2019 history of martial law and civil unrest is deeply entangled with patterns of elite family competition, brokerage, and the transactional structure of power, especially in the context of the Marcos and Duterte dynasties. My expertise allows for evaluating the likelihood that the current crisis will disrupt the status quo of managed conflict and elite accommodation, or escalate into mass unrest or martial law.",
            "status_quo": "No major civil unrest (meeting the thresholds) or martial law. While the Philippines regularly experiences protests, localized violence, and elite rivalry, national-level martial law or large-scale unrest (1,000+ deaths or 5,000+ arrests in the context of unrest) are rare. The last instance of martial law was the 2017 Mindanao declaration in response to the Marawi siege.",

Despite fierce competition, patron-client systems usually absorb shocks via negotiation, brokerage, and selective repression rather than descending into full-scale civil unrest or martial law. The current Marcos-Duterte feud is severe but follows a historical pattern of elite bargaining."

Martial law declarations have happened only four times since WWII, almost always in response to extraordinary violence or breakdown of state control (e.g., Marawi 2017, Maguindanao massacre 2009).

Large-scale unrest (1,000+ deaths or 5,000 arrests) is uncommon outside of Mindanao or in the absence of a dramatic trigger (e.g., coup, widespread rebellion). Current unrest is highly regionalized, with Duterte support concentrated in Davao and Mindanao, and most protests elsewhere not reaching critical mass."

His family's threats, regional mobilization, and the Marcos administration\u2019s hardline tactics raise the risk of escalation, particularly if the local clientelist networks are activated for mass mobilization."

            "no_scenario": "The Marcos administration continues to manage elite rivalry using selective repression and patronage, keeping protests and unrest below the threshold for 1,000 deaths or 5,000 arrests. Even if regional violence erupts in Mindanao, it is contained by local military-police action and elite negotiation, avoiding a declaration of martial law. Protests in Manila and other urban centers, while substantial, remain peaceful or are suppressed without mass casualties or arrests. International pressure, economic risk, and the desire to avoid ICC scrutiny restrain draconian state responses.",
            "yes_scenario": "A major violent incident erupts in Mindanao\u2014possibly triggered by Duterte loyalists or a breakaway local force\u2014resulting in sustained armed conflict and forcing the Marcos government to declare martial law in the region (similar to 2017). Alternatively, a dramatic escalation of protests in Manila (e.g., a massacre or mass arrests at a protest) leads to a crackdown that surpasses the question\u2019s thresholds. An elite split becomes unmanageable, with local warlords or police-military units defecting, resulting in mass unrest and a state of emergency.",
            "final_reasoning": "Base rates and the logic of patron-clientelism suggest the status quo of managed instability will continue, especially given the high international and domestic costs of martial law or mass repression. The Duterte arrest and Marcos-Duterte feud have raised tensions, particularly in Mindanao, but so far violence remains localized and manageable. The last martial law was in 2017 and was limited in scope. Recent large protests have not reached the critical level of violence or mass arrests required for a 'Yes' resolution. The possibility of a sudden trigger in Mindanao or a major protest crackdown cannot be dismissed, especially given the open threats from Duterte\u2019s family and the breakdown of elite accommodation. However, the most likely scenario is continued elite maneuvering, selective repression, and localized violence\u2014short of the resolution criteria. Given these dynamics, and weighing the increased risk but also the strong status quo bias, I assess the probability of major civil unrest or martial law in the Philippines in 2025 at 22%.",
