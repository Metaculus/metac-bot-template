Structural pressures\u2014economic hardship, insurgencies, legitimacy crises\u2014persist in several states (Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea-Bissau, Benin, CAR), but the period until Jan 1, 2026, is brief, and most regimes are currently suppressing opposition and monitoring dissent. The scenario most likely to trigger a coup would be an internal military split in the Sahel or a botched transition in a fragile state.

The short time to resolution (43 days) further lowers odds, as successful coups often take months to percolate from unrest to action. Latin America shows no credible near-term coup threat; self-coup potential is present but unlikely to escalate to a 'successful' coup before the deadline. Overall, while risk is elevated compared to global averages, the window is short and the most vulnerable regimes have recently suppressed or survived coup plots.

Ongoing internal dissent in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, combined with recent failed and attempted coups (Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau), signal instability. However, the presence of foreign support (Russia) may temporarily stabilize these regimes, and the short time horizon somewhat limits the likelihood of full-scale coup success, as most recent attempts have been suppressed.

Considering all the factors, I judge the probability of a successful coup (as defined by Metaculus) in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026, to be moderately above the base rate, but not extreme, due to the very short window and current regime survival strategies.",

            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing instability and dissatisfaction, military and elite factions in Africa and Latin America avoid overt attempts to unseat the executive, or any coup attempt is quickly suppressed or fails to consolidate control. Existing juntas in Africa maintain power through repression, elite co-optation, and foreign backing (notably Russia), and Latin American governments weather political crises without breakdown. The status quo of contested but stable (or at least stable-junta) regimes holds through the end of 2025.",
            "yes_scenario": "A faction within the military or security apparatus in an African country (most likely Mali, Burkina Faso, or Niger) successfully overthrows the sitting executive, either due to internal military splits, deteriorating security (e.g., loss of Bamako in Mali), or elite dissatisfaction with junta leadership. Alternatively, a sitting leader in Latin America (less likely, e.g., Nicaragua or Venezuela) enacts a self-coup, suspending constitutional order and forcibly consolidating power after an election, but this is less probable given current trends and institutional resilience.",
            "final_reasoning": "The probability of a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026, is meaningfully above zero given the recent base rate in Africa, persistent instability, elite factionalization, and ongoing jihadist threats. Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger remain at the highest risk, with evidence of internal dissent and failed coup attempts in the past year. However, several factors reduce the likelihood: (1) The short time window (six weeks) means that, even at high annual base rates, the per-month risk is modest; (2) Existing regimes in the Sahel have consolidated power with external (Russian) support, making internal coups riskier and more difficult; (3) No imminent Latin American case is at the threshold of a successful coup, with recent attempts failing and militaries remaining under civilian control. While the situation in Mali is precarious (jihadist encroachment, economic collapse, reported coup plots), and Burkina Faso and Niger face similar pressures, successful coups require both elite coordination and an opportunity, which is unpredictable over a short horizon. Given these considerations, and grounding in base rates (roughly 2\u20134 successful coups per year in Africa over the last five years, but none in Latin America), the probability for a coup in the next six weeks is moderate but not high. I estimate the risk at 20%. This is notably above pure status quo (which, for a random six-week segment, would be below 10%), but not extreme, reflecting both elevated Sahel risk and the short time to resolution.",
