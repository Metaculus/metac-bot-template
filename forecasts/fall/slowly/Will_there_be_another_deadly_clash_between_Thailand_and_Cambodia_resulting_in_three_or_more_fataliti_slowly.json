The peace agreements are fragile and have already broken down repeatedly, with both sides maintaining high alert and suspending de-escalatory steps. Recent incidents involved fatalities, but so far not above the three-death threshold since July 31. However, the presence of great powers, ASEAN mediation, and the high-profile diplomatic calendar (including the Thai king's visit to China) provide some restraint. The main factor decreasing the probability is the short remaining time frame, which limits the window for a flareup to spin out of control. Nonetheless, given the persistent volatility, the pattern of deadly incidents every few months, and the lack of resolution to underlying issues, the risk remains substantially elevated. A well-justified bold forecast, reflecting the high but not overwhelming risk, is warranted.",

            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing tensions, patrol-level incidents, and heated rhetoric, both sides exercise restraint\u2014possibly due to international pressure and economic incentives. Any skirmishes or mine incidents cause casualties below the three-fatality threshold, or are isolated to non-military actors, or are contained before they escalate. The ceasefire, though fragile, limps across the new year without another incident that meets the question's criteria.",
            "yes_scenario": "A mine explosion, rogue patrol clash, or artillery exchange\u2014triggered by a miscalculation, command breakdown, or deliberate provocation\u2014results in three or more deaths (military or law enforcement) on one or both sides. This could occur in a disputed border zone, possibly exacerbated by a retaliatory cycle. International mediation comes after the fact, but the deadly incident meets the resolution criteria.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for deadly Thai-Cambodian border clashes reaching three or more fatalities is relatively low on a weekly or monthly basis, but spikes during periods of crisis. The summer 2025 escalation saw dozens killed, but that was the first such incident in years; minor incidents (with 1-2 deaths) are more common. However, the November 2025 news shows the ceasefire is already breaking down: there have been landmine deaths, a shooting that killed at least one, and mutual accusations of violations. Both sides have suspended key elements of the peace deal, and local commanders are on edge, with nationalist rhetoric on the rise. The presence of international mediators (US, China, Malaysia, ASEAN) and the high-level diplomatic engagement (e.g., the Thai king\u2019s visit to China) provide some downward pressure on escalation, but their effectiveness is undermined by the transactional, fragile nature of recent deals and limited local buy-in. Given the short time window (6 weeks), the probability of a major, multi-fatality clash is lower than during the initial crisis, but higher than in a truly stable situation. I estimate the base rate for a 3+ fatality incident during a 6-week post-ceasefire period at 15-25% in the absence of strong deterrents, but given the current context\u2014recent breakdown, mutual provocations, but also active international engagement\u2014I lean toward the higher end of that range. My final probability is 28%.",
