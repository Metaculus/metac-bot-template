Analyst consensus is for a beat, but expectations are extremely high, setting up asymmetric risks: a blockbuster quarter and guidance could easily propel NVDA above $220, while any disappointment could shock the market and send the stock below $180 (especially since $178.91 is a recent technical low). Nvidia's historical post-earnings moves have frequently exceeded 5-10%, and both implied and realized volatility are elevated. Market structure (NVDA's massive index weight, retail participation, and momentum trading) amplifies the risk of outsized moves. Given these dynamics, the probability that NVDA closes above $220 or below $180 on at least one day before November 22 is high, though not certain. I weight the risk of a close above $220 as more likely than a close below $180, but both are plausible. The probability is further supported by the potential for technical breakouts, macro sensitivity, and the crowded bullish trade (which increases both upside and downside tail risk). Therefore, I assign a probability close to, but not at, certainty.",
