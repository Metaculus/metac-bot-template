The vast majority of funding has been joint or private, with federal investment often indirect or enabling (energy, regulation, export controls).

The resolution's requirement for an official White House press release explicitly committing at least $2 billion in US government funding for accelerating AGI is a high bar, and there is no strong evidence in the current news flow of such a press release having already been issued; nor is there clear indication of one being imminent, though it is certainly plausible. The timing window is now very tight (less than two months). Historically, moonshot-style initiatives (e.g., Cancer Moonshot, Operation Warp Speed, AI Manhattan Project) have been announced with significant fanfare, but typically these occur at the start of an administration or fiscal year, or in response to acute events. Given the already numerous and enormous AI announcements, the administration may feel it has already claimed this ground, and it is possible the specific resolution criteria will not be met before Jan 1.

            "no_scenario": "Despite ongoing announcements of massive AI, energy, and infrastructure projects by the Trump administration and its private sector partners, no official White House press release is issued before January 1, 2026, that unambiguously commits at least $2B in direct federal funding specifically for accelerating AGI (or even broad AI). Instead, the federal role continues to be framed as regulatory, facilitative, and leveraging private capital, with most investments described as public-private partnerships, energy infrastructure, or generalized AI development rather than a federal AGI moonshot.",
            "yes_scenario": "Amid intensifying geopolitical and economic competition with China, and following mounting public pressure or a major AI-related event (e.g., a breakthrough or a perceived threat), the White House issues a press release before the end of 2025 announcing a new, named $2B+ federal initiative (possibly with private sector co-funding) specifically to accelerate AGI, clearly framed as a 'moonshot' akin to the Apollo program, with explicit reference to government commitment and AGI-focused objectives.",
            "final_reasoning": "Despite historically unprecedented private AI investments and strong national security/political incentives, there is still no evidence of an official White House press release announcing a $2B+ federal 'moonshot' to accelerate AGI. The Stargate and energy/nuclear projects, while massive and involving government facilitation, have not been officially described as direct federal AGI-acceleration initiatives. The resolution criteria are strict\u2014requiring a federal press release, explicit commitment, and AGI/AI acceleration focus. With less than two months left, the high political salience of AI makes a last-minute announcement possible, but the base rate for such large, direct, new federal R&D commitments in the final months of a calendar year is low. Given the cost-benefit analysis perspective, the administration has so far preferred to leverage private capital and regulatory changes rather than direct multi-billion federal AGI investment. I estimate the probability at 22%.",
