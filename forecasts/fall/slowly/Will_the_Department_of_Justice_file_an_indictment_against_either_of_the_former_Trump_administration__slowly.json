The Comey prosecution has already generated significant judicial pushback, with judges admonishing the DOJ for 'indict first, investigate second' tactics. Such scrutiny raises the reputational and legal risk of further controversial indictments. Moreover, the time window is short (eight weeks), and there is no public reporting of imminent grand jury action or sealed indictments against Krebs or Taylor. Historically, even in periods of politicized DOJ action (e.g., McCarthy era, Nixon's enemies list), the number of actual indictments of former senior officials for dissent or leaks without clear evidence is extremely low. The fact that Krebs and Taylor have been publicly targeted and investigated does raise the risk above the historical base rate, but not dramatically so\u2014especially given the recent blowback over Comey and the absence of credible evidence of criminal conduct by either Krebs or Taylor.

The direct presidential memoranda targeting Krebs and Taylor, the DOJ's demonstrated pattern of aggressive prosecutions, and the evident disregard for long-standing prosecutorial norms all push the probability higher than the historical base rate. Still, there are significant brakes: lack of clear evidence, risk of severe backlash, and the increasingly visible resistance from career prosecutors and judges. On balance, while the probability is much higher than the historical ~1% for such cases, it does not cross the 50% threshold, as the legal and institutional barriers remain formidable, and neither Krebs nor Taylor appears to have committed conduct that would easily fit a federal criminal statute. However, the risk is substantial and rising, and a scenario in which at least one is indicted as an act of political retaliation cannot be ruled out.

However, the absence of credible public evidence of criminal activity by Krebs or Taylor, the risks of overreach (as highlighted by judicial pushback in the Comey case), and the inherent friction in the grand jury process (which still requires some plausible narrative of criminality) moderate the likelihood.
