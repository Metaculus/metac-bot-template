That said, the situation is unusually volatile compared to a typical opposition cycle, and the risk of a forced resignation is meaningfully elevated. Weighing the historical stability of party leaders, the current turbulence, the lack of a single smoking-gun scandal, and the party\u2019s preference for avoiding further self-inflicted wounds so close to a potential national election, I estimate Feij\u00f3o has a better-than-even chance to survive, but with substantial risk.",

The news coverage paints a picture of mounting elite dissatisfaction and a credibility crisis, but not yet a coordinated move against Feij\u00f3o. There is inertia and lack of an alternative, but the risk of a coup or forced resignation before end-2025 is non-trivial and notably higher than the historical base rate for opposition leaders. Given the strict resolution criteria (any break in leadership counts as No), the risk must be weighted more heavily.

The time to resolution is just over a year, with no national election scheduled and no clear, unified challenger. While Feij\u00f3o's leadership is clearly weakened and his inability to resolve the Maz\u00f3n crisis makes his position precarious, the inertia of party structures, the lack of an organized opposition, and the logistical challenges of replacing a leader outside of an electoral defeat make a sudden ousting less likely.

Persistent internal divisions\u2014particularly between Feij\u00f3o loyalists and regional heavyweights (e.g., Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, Carlos Maz\u00f3n)\u2014have undermined his authority. Recent crises in Valencia and Madrid, the fallout from Maz\u00f3n\u2019s scandal, and Ayuso\u2019s ongoing defiance all point to a fragile leadership grip."

Feij\u00f3o\u2019s position is insulated by the risk-aversion of PP elites, who recall the damaging effects of rapid leadership turnover (e.g., the Casado crisis of 2022)."

However, the fear of further fragmentation or a damaging leadership contest may lead the party to avoid open conflict until after the next major electoral test."

With no general election expected before late 2026/2027 and only regional contests (with the exception of possible early elections in Valencia or Extremadura), party elites may prefer to maintain stability rather than risk further turbulence before a major national vote."

This could occur if (a) the Maz\u00f3n crisis escalates, causing a cascade of regional PP barons to withdraw support; (b) Ayuso or another major regional figure mounts a public leadership challenge, capitalizing on continued polling declines or an electoral debacle in a key region; or (c) external events (e.g., a major corruption scandal implicating Feij\u00f3o or a sudden snap general election loss) catalyze a rapid internal revolt.",
            "yes_scenario": "Despite mounting criticism and electoral erosion, Feij\u00f3o retains the formal leadership through the end of 2025. Internal opposition remains fragmented or risk-averse, no single challenger consolidates support, and PP elites prefer to postpone a leadership transition until after major national elections or until a clearer alternative emerges.",
            "final_reasoning": "Applying base rates from Spanish party politics, party leaders rarely fall between major electoral cycles unless hit by personal scandals or catastrophic defeats. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s position is visibly weakened, with multiple news articles highlighting his passivity, internal criticisms, and loss of voter confidence. However, the internal PP machinery is cautious, and replacing a leader is a high-risk, high-cost move, especially with no unifying successor in place. The Maz\u00f3n crisis is serious but not yet existential for Feij\u00f3o; most pressure is indirect and channeled through media criticism and anonymous party sources. The status quo bias in Spanish party politics, the lack of a triggering event (e.g., a snap general election or a criminal indictment), and the potential chaos of a mid-cycle leadership contest all slightly favor Feij\u00f3o\u2019s survival. I estimate a significant risk of a 'No' outcome\u2014higher than the naive base rate\u2014but the most likely scenario is that Feij\u00f3o clings on through 2025, albeit with eroded authority.",
