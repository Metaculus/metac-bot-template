Congress or a federal agency, under public and bipartisan pressure, passes an emergency measure that sets strict limits on the total compute capacity (e.g., number of GPUs or datacenter power draw) an individual or company may possess. The law applies nationwide and is justified on national security or environmental grounds.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate for the US imposing hard caps on private computational capacity is extremely low; no significant precedent exists outside of nuclear/chemical contexts, and current AI risks, while debated, have not triggered a comparable policy response. The dominant federal political agenda is focused on rapid AI expansion, deregulation, and blocking of restrictive state laws. Industry lobbying is unusually unified and powerful. While there is growing international and public concern about datacenter energy use and AI risk, US policy is moving in the opposite direction, with the administration actively facilitating more datacenter access and compute buildout. State-level regulations are focused on application domains, not hardware limits, and are being challenged or preempted. No recent news points toward a legislative process or executive order that would impose nationwide compute caps before 2026. While a catastrophic black swan event could change this, such a scenario remains highly improbable within the timeframe. The status quo is robust, and the incentives for change are weak compared to the barriers.",
