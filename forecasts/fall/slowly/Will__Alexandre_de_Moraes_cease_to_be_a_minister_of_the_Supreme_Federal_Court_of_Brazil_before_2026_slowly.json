Despite being a polarizing figure, Moraes enjoys robust constitutional protections, institutional backing, and a fractured opposition. The most recent news shows him doubling down on controversial legal actions, with no sign of retreat or credible new threat to his tenure. While international criticism and right-wing opposition have intensified, they have not translated into actionable political risk. The Senate is not currently aligned to pursue impeachment, and the political right is weakened and divided.

The political environment, while polarized, has recently seen the right lose both cohesion and mobilization power. De Moraes retains strong support among judicial peers and the centrist elements of the political elite, who view him as a key defender of institutional order, especially after the January 8th coup attempt and the subsequent trials. Recent news demonstrates the continued assertiveness of de Moraes and the STF, but also the failure of opposition strategies to gain meaningful traction. While international criticism and sanctions are notable, they have not translated to actionable domestic pressure. The only plausible risks are truly extraordinary events or a personal decision, neither of which are currently signaled in the news. Thus, the probability of de Moraes ceasing to be a minister before 2026 remains very low, though not absolute zero given rising international controversy and persistent, if weakened, domestic opposition.",
