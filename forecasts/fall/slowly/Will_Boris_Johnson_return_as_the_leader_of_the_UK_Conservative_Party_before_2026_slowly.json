The only plausible route involves a total party meltdown and the absence of any other unifying figure\u2014circumstances which, even now, seem more likely to lead to another leadership contest among sitting MPs or a managed transition to a less tainted figure. The latest news coverage shows Tories are trying to repudiate Johnson, not resurrect him. While the party is desperate, it is not yet irrational to the point of re-electing the architect of many of its current woes. Therefore, the odds remain extremely low, though not absolutely zero, as British politics can surprise. My final probability reflects both the base rate and the specifics of the current moment.",

Badenoch is embattled but not yet toppled, and potential successors (Jenrick, others) are waiting in the wings.

The party's strategy is to distance itself from Johnson, not revive him. Historical base rates for such a rapid, scandal-tainted return are close to zero. Even amid deep instability, parties rarely repeat failed leadership choices so quickly, especially when blaming that leader for their current crisis. Only a truly extraordinary, black-swan event would put Johnson back in contention. The probability is accordingly extremely low, but not absolutely zero.",
