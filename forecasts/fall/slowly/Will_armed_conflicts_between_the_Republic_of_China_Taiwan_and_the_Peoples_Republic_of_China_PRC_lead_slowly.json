The domestic mood in Taiwan favors de-escalation, and while Xi Jinping's reunification deadline rhetoric and Japan's new assertiveness add risk, the closing time window (just over a month remaining) makes it extremely unlikely that a new, deadly exchange will occur and rapidly escalate to 100+ deaths.

Arms sales and alliance signaling by the US and Japan reinforce deterrence rather than provoke immediate war. There are no reports of exchanges of fire between PRC and ROC military forces causing even minor casualties, let alone 100+ deaths, within the past year. The base rate for such an event is extremely low. While the risk of accidental escalation is never zero, and the new Japanese angle marginally increases risk, there is no concrete indication (mobilization, war preparations, breakdown of crisis communications) that a major armed clash is imminent in the next 1.5 months.

The PRC is highly sensitive to external intervention but also acutely aware of the catastrophic consequences of a major kinetic conflict\u2014especially with strong US and Japanese warnings. The window to the resolution (just over a month) is extremely short for a major conflict to break out, be recognized by three credible sources, and cause 100 deaths. Rhetorical escalation and military posturing are classic methods to signal resolve and deter adversaries without crossing the threshold into open conflict. Historical base rates overwhelmingly favor the status quo. The most likely outcome is continued tension without a triggering incident large enough to meet the resolution criteria. A 'Yes' outcome would require a dramatic, unheralded shift in Chinese policy or an accident spiraling out of control\u2014neither of which is currently indicated by observable evidence.",
