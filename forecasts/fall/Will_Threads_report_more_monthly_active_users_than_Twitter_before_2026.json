While web usage gives X some overall edge, the aggregate best public MAU estimates indicate it is at most near even with Threads and likely dropping below soon, if not already. Mark Zuckerberg and Meta\u2019s executive team have a historical pattern of publicly touting milestone overtakes, increasing the probability that a report will be made if/when Threads definitively passes X.

The case, originally filed five years ago, centered on Meta\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. Judge Boasberg ruled that the FTC must demonstrate Meta currently holds monopoly power, not just past dominance, and concluded it failed to do so. In 2021, Boasberg had initially dismissed the case for insufficient evidence of Facebook\u2019s market power; the FTC later filed an amended complaint with additional data on user numbers and competitive metrics. In 2022, he allowed the case to proceed due to the enhanced detail. Key Meta figures\u2014including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, and other current and former executives\u2014testified during the trial, which began in April 2025. The FTC had argued that the acquisitions should have been blocked and demanded the divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp, claiming no viable alternatives exist to Facebook and Instagram for social communication. However, Judge Boasberg emphasized that the FTC must prove current anticompetitive behavior, not past actions, noting that social media\u2019s core use and content formats have changed significantly since Meta\u2019s early days. He found that TikTok and YouTube are now seen as genuine substitutes for Meta\u2019s platforms, with strong economic competition evidenced by user migration, Meta\u2019s massive investments to remain competitive, and internal industry documents identifying Meta as a key rival. Boasberg concluded: 'Meta is not an unchallenged monopolist,' and the evidence supporting Meta\u2019s competitive position was 'credible and persuasive.' This ruling follows a similar outcome in October 2025, when Google avoided forced divestiture despite being found to have monopolized the search market, though it was ordered to loosen control over search data.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2025 01:12 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/world/2025-11-19/doc-infxweku2393072.shtml)\n\n**US: Meta wins huge antitrust case, avoids break-up**\nOn November 18, 2025, US District Judge James Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta in a landmark antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020, preventing the company from being forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC had alleged that Meta acquired these platforms to eliminate competition, citing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2008 maxim, 'It's better to buy than compete.' Judge Boasberg concluded that the FTC failed to prove Meta currently holds monopoly power, stating that the market landscape has changed significantly: 'the wall' between social networking and social media has broken down. He emphasized that Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube now offer nearly identical features, particularly short-form video content via Reels, with only 7% of Instagram users now engaging primarily with friends' content. The court rejected the FTC\u2019s argument that 'connecting friends and family' constituted a distinct market separate from video entertainment platforms. Meta welcomed the ruling, with its chief legal officer stating that the company's products drive American innovation and economic growth. CEO Zuckerberg had previously sought intervention from former President Donald Trump, who, after returning to office, has supported major tech firms, while Zuckerberg and other tech leaders have made substantial donations to Trump\u2019s campaigns. The ruling marks a major victory for Meta in its ongoing legal and regulatory battles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 11:29 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/us-meta-wins-huge-antitrust-case-avoids-break-up/a-74798391)\n\n**U.S. Federal Judge Acquits Meta of Dominance Abuse Charges**\nA U.S. federal judge, James Boasberg, ruled on November 18, 2025, dismissing claims by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, abused its dominant market position following its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The FTC had argued these acquisitions were designed to reduce competition and maintain a near-monopoly in the personal social networking market. However, Judge Boasberg rejected the FTC\u2019s argument, stating that 'even if Meta benefited from monopoly in the past, the FTC must prove that this dominance continues\u2014and the agency failed to do so.' The decision represents a major legal victory for Meta. In a statement on X, Meta emphasized that the ruling recognizes the intense competition it faces, highlighting that its products deliver value to individuals and businesses and exemplify American innovation. During the trial, which took place in April and May 2025, FTC attorneys claimed Meta maintained a monopoly over 'personal social networking' by controlling users\u2019 relationships with family and friends, with Snapchat being the only real competitor. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s founder and CEO, and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg testified. FTC lawyers cited numerous reports of user dissatisfaction, particularly regarding the increasing number of ads, which continue to generate billions in profits. Meta countered that its main competitors are YouTube and TikTok, which operate in a broader, rapidly evolving global market and compete fiercely for user attention.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 09:13 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9/20251118-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A6-%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%87%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86)\n\n**Meta reacts to historic FTC antitrust case victory**\nMeta celebrated a major legal victory over the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on November 18, 2025, after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected the FTC\u2019s attempt to force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. The court ruled that the FTC failed to prove Meta retains monopoly power in social networking, citing the rapidly evolving digital landscape.

The FTC had argued in 2020\u2014during President Donald Trump's first term\u2014that Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp stifled competition. Meta countered that its investments enabled those platforms to grow to over 1 billion users and pointed to TikTok\u2019s rise as evidence of ongoing competitive pressure.

He specifically noted that TikTok and YouTube are now dominant competitors, with TikTok alone being sufficient to undermine the FTC\u2019s claim. The judge concluded that 'even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC's case.' The FTC may appeal, but it has not yet indicated plans to do so.

Threads, launched in July 2023 as a direct competitor to X (formerly Twitter), leveraged cross-promotion from Instagram, which had 968.6 million daily active users globally in October, and allowed sign-in via Instagram credentials.

The integration with Instagram remains a major advantage, allowing users to create accounts and share content across both platforms, which has helped Meta attract users and increase downloads. In contrast, Musk's X lost advertisers after its name change and now has lower average usage than two years ago. Threads has opened advertising worldwide and aims to monetize its growing user base in high\u2011spending markets such as the United States and Japan.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 09:52 PM\nSource:[Ambito](https://www.ambito.com/tecnologia/elon-musk-pierde-escandalosamente-contra-mark-zuckerberg-la-guerra-x-versus-threads-n6195378)\n\n**Threads Finally Surpasses X: Zuckerberg\u2019s Platform Overtakes Musk\u2019s in Daily Users**\nForbes reports that Meta\u2019s text\u2011centric platform Threads has overtaken Elon Musk\u2019s X in global mobile daily active users (DAUs) for the first time in September 2024.  According to Similarweb data for the week of 15\u201321\u202fSeptember, Threads averaged 130.2\u202fmillion DAUs versus 130.1\u202fmillion for X.  The same source lists 128.7\u202fmillion DAUs for Threads on 20\u202fSeptember, slightly above X\u2019s 127.1\u202fmillion.  On iOS, Threads led with 62.5\u202fmillion DAUs against X\u2019s 56.6\u202fmillion.  In the United States, X still dominates with 21.3\u202fmillion DAUs versus Threads\u2019 16.2\u202fmillion, and X\u2019s web traffic (140.7\u202fmillion DAUs on x.com) far exceeds Threads\u2019 7.7\u202fmillion.  Android users spend an average of 4:04\u202fminutes on X, nearly double the 2:14\u202fminutes on Threads.\n\nThe article highlights Threads\u2019 rapid growth since its 2023 launch as an Instagram spin\u2011off.  Ross Sandler of Barclays Research notes that Threads could generate an estimated US$2\u202fbillion in advertising revenue in 2026 and US$9\u202fbillion in 2027, citing its \u201chigh monetization potential\u201d in high\u2011spending markets such as the United States and Japan.  In contrast, X\u2019s global ad revenue fell 51.7\u202f% to US$2\u202fbillion in 2023 and dropped another 2.3\u202f% the following year, according to Emarketer.  Emarketer projects X\u2019s first post\u2011Musk ad\u2011revenue growth in 2025, a 16.5\u202f% increase to US$2.26\u202fbillion.\n\nQuotes from the article include: Ross Sandler saying \u2018Meta is illuminating new ad inventory groups with Threads\u2019; Mark Zuckerberg stating \u2018Threads has 3\u202fbillion monthly active users\u2019; and Mark Mahaney asserting \u2018Threads\u2019 deep integration with Instagram gives it an advantage over X for growth of revenue and user base.\u2019\n\nThe piece presents data and expert commentary without overt editorializing, offering a balanced view of the competitive dynamics between the two platforms.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 05:56 PM\nSource:[Forbes M\u00e9xico](https://forbes.com.mx/threads-finalmente-rebasa-a-x-la-plataforma-de-zuckerberg-supera-a-la-de-musk-en-usuarios-diarios/)\n\n**Instagram Monthly Active Users Reach 3\u202fBillion \u2013 China \u2013 Ansa.it**\nAfter 15 years since its launch, Instagram has exceeded 3\u202fbillion monthly active users, as announced by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Threads.

Bloomberg reports that Meta will update Instagram to focus more on 'reels'\u2014video clips that compete with Tik Tok. The redesign will feature a navigation bar that 'highlights private messages and reels', and a test in Korea and India will let users set reels as the home feed instead of photos and videos. Tik Tok faces uncertainty in the U.S.; days earlier, President Trump confirmed an agreement to hand the platform's algorithm 'to the United States', easing public concerns about a possible shutdown.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 08:01 AM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/china/notizie/cina/2025/09/25/instagram-30-_71667eec-235b-4452-9ee2-fd1cd21a4201.html)\n\n**Threads Surpasses 400 Million Active Monthly Users, Closing Gap on X**\nThreads, the latest social network from Meta, has surpassed 400 million active monthly users, marking a 100 million increase from December 2024 and a 200 million increase from August of the same year.

According to Fast Company, this growth indicates a strong consolidation of Threads as a direct competitor to X, Elon Musk's social platform, which is focusing on its AI-powered chatbot Grok. While X is estimated to have around 550 million active monthly users as of March 2024, Threads is rapidly closing the gap, especially in terms of daily active mobile users, as shown by Similarweb's public data. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has stated that his goal is to reach 1 billion active monthly users on Threads, and the platform is implementing new features, such as direct messages, real-time news and trending topics, to achieve this target. The rapid growth of Threads confirms the increasing interest of users in alternative and innovative social networks, especially those integrated with AI and real-time content.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 10:04 AM\nSource:[Leggo online](https://www.leggo.it/tecnologia/news/threads_supera_400_milioni_record_sfida_x_oggi_13_8_2025-9011104.html)\n\n**Threads Surpasses 4 Billion MAU, Approaching X's Daily Mobile App Usage**\nMeta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) Threads has surpassed 4 billion monthly active users (MAU) in just two years since its launch as a competitor to social media X. Instagram's Adam Mosseri announced this on Tuesday (12th). Following this news, Meta's stock price has broken through its 52-week high of $784.75. According to data from TechCrunch, Threads added 50 million monthly users in the last quarter, bringing its total to 3.5 billion MAU, as reported by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April. X still leads with over 6 billion MAU, according to former CEO Linda Yaccarino's past statement. However, Similarweb data shows that Threads is approaching X's daily mobile app usage. Meta launched Threads in 2023 as a potential 'X killer' to attract users from Elon Musk's platform. As of June 2025, Threads has 111.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android, a 127.8% increase from the same period last year. In contrast, X has 13.2 million daily active users, a 15.2% decrease from the same period last year. On the web, X still dominates with an average daily global visitor count of 144.8 million in June, compared to Threads' 6.9 million. Threads' growth is attributed to the wave of new features introduced over the past year, including DM, Pedibers integration, customized feeds, and AI tools. Meta's stock price has risen 31.83% so far this year. Wall Street analysts have revised their price targets and reaffirmed their buy ratings based on Meta's strong 2Q 2025 earnings and optimistic 3Q outlook. Analysts from Rosenblatt, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, Wedbush, and KeyBanc highlighted accelerated ad revenue, increased engagement, and rapid progress in AI-driven monetization as key positives. They noted that Meta's massive AI investment, including increased capital expenditures on data centers, infrastructure, and product development, is already driving stronger ad conversion rates, deeper user engagement, and new revenue streams. They pointed out that Meta is leading in AI, expanding monetization across the platform, and maintaining double-digit growth despite increasing costs. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 09:31 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/47080018/mau-4)\n\n**Thread Surpasses 400 Million Monthly Active Users, Closes Gap with X**\nMeta's social media platform 'Thread' has surpassed 400 million monthly active users (MAU) in just two years since its launch, rapidly closing the gap with its competitor X (formerly Twitter). According to reports from TechCrunch and other foreign media outlets, Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, said that as of a few weeks ago, the number of people using Thread every month had exceeded 400 million. Thread was launched in July 2023 as a rival to X. It took two years for the platform to reach 400 million monthly users. The recent surge is significant. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, announced in April that Thread had reached 350 million monthly active users, and in just one quarter, the number increased by 50 million. Mosseri said, 'We started with the absurd idea of competing with Twitter, but now Thread has become a meaningful platform where people can freely exchange different perspectives.' He expressed gratitude to everyone who has contributed to creating today's Thread and said, 'There is still much to be done, and I expect further development.' Thread is rapidly closing the gap with X. According to SimilerWeb, a market research firm, as of June, Thread's daily active users on iPhone and Android mobile apps reached 111.5 million, a 127.8% increase from the previous year, while X had 132 million daily active users, a 15.2% decrease from the previous year. This is the result of various new features released in the past year, including direct messages, Fediverse integration, customized feeds, and AI feature enhancements. However, in terms of web access, X still leads the way. In June, X's average global web visitors reached 145.8 million per day, while Thread had only 6.9 million.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 06:27 AM\nSource:[\uae30\uc220\ub85c \uc138\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc14\uafb8\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc758 \ub180\uc774\ud130](https://it.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2023092145730)\n\n**Threads Surpasses 4 Billion Monthly Active Users, Closing in on X**\nMeta's social media platform Threads has surpassed 4 billion monthly active users (MAU) in just two years since its launch, closing in on Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, announced on August 12 that Threads has reached 4 billion MAU, a significant milestone. Mosseri said, 'We started with a crazy idea to compete with Twitter, but now Threads has evolved into a platform where people can freely share their perspectives.' Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, previously announced in April that Threads had reached 350 million MAU, a 500 million user increase in just one quarter. Threads is rapidly catching up to X, with Musk stating that X has around 6 billion MAU. According to Similerweb, a market research firm, Threads' mobile daily active users are also approaching X's numbers, with 111.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android devices in June, a 127.8% increase from the previous year. In contrast, X had 132 million daily active users in June, a 15.2% decrease from the previous year. However, X still leads in web traffic, with an average of 145.8 million daily visitors in June, compared to Threads' 690,000 daily visitors. Threads has been attracting users with new features such as direct messages, federated social networking, customized feeds, and AI enhancements. In Korea, Threads is growing rapidly among 20-30-year-olds, with a domestic MAU of 5.43 million in July, a 240 million increase from the previous year. An IT industry insider said, 'Threads, a text-based SNS like X, has naturally become a platform for informal communication, and is gaining popularity among young people.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 12:47 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2025/08/13/BSZCAFULX5G2VPONJIWDEMAPIU/)\n\n",
    "date": "2025-11-19T21:11:14.039396",
    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is very strong consensus that Threads is highly likely to publicly report more monthly active users (MAUs) than Twitter/X before the end of 2025. All experts cite rapid and sustained MAU growth for Threads (now at or above 400 million), fueled by Meta\u2019s integration with Instagram, network effects, and positive user migration, contrasted against X\u2019s stagnation or decline (with MAU estimates falling or flat around 500\u2013550 million since March 2024). Thread\u2019s mobile daily active usage has already overtaken X by several measures, and MAU parity is imminent or already achieved based on most recent data points.\n\nKey factors increasing the probability include Threads\u2019 Instagram-based onboarding and network leverage, Meta\u2019s resources and product development pace, declining user satisfaction and engagement on X (due to controversies, rebranding, and advertiser flight), and historical precedents of platform turnovers when incumbents falter. The main risk cited across forecasters is ambiguity: the YES resolution requires Meta to publish a clear MAU number above the most credible public estimate for X, and factually comparable figures must be available before December 31, 2025. While measurement/definition mismatches or non-disclosure are possible, Meta\u2019s incentive to publicly declare this milestone is viewed as very strong, especially after similar major platform overtakes in past digital history. \n\nNo forecaster sees significant likelihood of an X/Twitter recovery or a Threads stall sufficient to prevent crossover, with all assigning high probabilities (ranging from 80% to 95%) for a YES outcome. Final risks reside in public reporting clarity and metric comparability rather than underlying platform dynamics, which overwhelmingly favor Threads. In summary: The aggregate forecast is that it is extremely likely Meta (Threads) will report a higher MAU than Twitter/X before 2026, pending clear and timely public disclosure.",
