The resolution criteria require at least $2B of explicit federal funding with acceleration of AI/AGI as the clear stated goal in a White House press release. No such initiative (comparable to the Biden Cancer Moonshot or ARPA-H) is evident in official White House documentation as of November 2025, despite much larger-sounding numbers in the news. The two-month window is very short for launching a genuinely new federal moonshot of that scale, especially if it hasn't already been prefigured in the 2026 federal budget or a major OSTP/federal science agency rollout. However, the possibility cannot be completely ruled out because of the ongoing public framing of a 'race with China' and national security rhetoric, which creates political incentive for a dramatic announcement. Given the overwhelming dominance of private-led investment, the lack of a dedicated federal initiative with new funds announced as of Nov 2025, and the strictness of the resolution language\u2014while recognizing an outside chance remains for a Hail Mary end-of-year announcement\u2014I forecast a moderately confident No, but not with extremal certainty.",

To date, the administration\u2019s largest announcements (e.g., Stargate, energy grid, nuclear buildouts) have combined public and private funding, but federal contributions are generally dwarfed by the headline numbers and are not always clearly earmarked for AGI acceleration rather than broader AI infrastructure. From a budget process perspective, the window for new appropriations is extremely tight, limiting opportunities for headline-grabbing new federal commitments prior to year-end. However, given Trump\u2019s political appetite for high-visibility initiatives and the rapidly escalating U.S.-China AGI rivalry, the probability is non-trivial that a final, qualifying press release could be engineered by year-end. Still, given the need for precise language, a clearly federal commitment, and historical federal administrative caution about AGI, the odds remain well below even. Base rate for such explicit federal AGI 'moonshots' is near zero, but recent momentum and political incentives raise the odds above negligible.

Yet, the defining pattern is that these investments are not direct, federal-only 'moonshots'; rather, they are industry-led, with government as facilitator, enabler, or minority stakeholder. PET would expect a real moonshot precipitated by an exogenous shock or sudden reframing, but such a focusing event has not visibly occurred since the question opened, and there is little historical precedent for a surprise pre-election White House AGI moonshot of this scale announced in less than 2 months. The clearest recent White House-linked initiatives (e.g., Stargate, $80B nuclear, $92B AI/energy) are either multi-partner ventures with ambiguous federal funding components, not explicitly dedicated to AGI acceleration, or lack the necessary direct federal outlay. Given these facts, and the very short window remaining for a qualifying announcement, the probability of the White House making a clear, official $2B+ AGI moonshot announcement before 2026 remains low, though not impossible given the high-pressure policy environment.",

Despite provocative analogies ('Manhattan II'), no news item describes a recent White House press release unambiguously announcing a direct $2B+ federal commitment to AGI acceleration as a 'moonshot.' The $80B nuclear initiative appears aimed at infrastructure indirectly supporting AI, not AGI-centric moonshot R&D. Given the cost-benefit lens, politicians know that leveraging private capital is far more efficient and less politically risky than a large, single federal outlay, especially outside a true national crisis. The historical base rate of Apollo/Manhattan-type moonshots is much lower than the rate of public-private or promotional 'massive investments,' even in periods of high-tech competition. Therefore, absent clearer evidence in the next two months, and despite apparent political will, I assess the probability that the White House will issue a qualifying press release before January 1, 2026 as <50%.

The repeated and widespread consensus among domain experts is that all recent splashes are either predominantly private-led, public-private hybrids, or lack the direct, explicit, on-paper federal commitment in an official White House press release that the question demands. My original forecast arguably over-weighted the possibility that this era\u2019s spectacle and urgency would override the routine procedural hurdles (budget, agency, comms). Importantly, the group\u2019s emphasis on timing, coordination inertia, and incentive toward ambiguity (not clarity) in announcement language further constrains the path to a YES outcome. Given these points, I am revising my probability downward to better reflect the high procedural bar and the odds that, despite extraordinary AI moonshot rhetoric, nothing will qualify through January 1, 2026.",

Forecasters focusing on the federal science policy process, appropriations, and formal White House communication procedures articulated the critical distinction between performative partnership/PR 'moonshots' and bona fide, OMB-anchored, White House-announced AGI acceleration initiatives with explicit federal funding commitment. They emphasized that all meaningful historical precedents for science moonshots followed visible OSTP, OMB, and budget coordination\u2014something plainly absent here, despite the rhetorical moonshot framing and immense private sector totals. The strong consensus across these arguments is that the current wave of announcements (Stargate, nuclear, etc.) are almost certainly not qualifying under the stated resolution criteria, and that there is insufficient evidence the final weeks of 2025 will produce the necessary bureaucratic machinery, especially given institutional and fiscal inertia. While the arms race scenario leaves a residual chance for a dramatic, qualifying announcement, even my original initial forecast seems slightly too high versus the preponderance of evidence. I have therefore revised my probability downward.",

Arguments based in Federal Policy, Budget Process, and AI Governance consistently highlight that nearly all recent announcements are public-private blends or regulatory/infrastructural, not direct, clearly earmarked federal AGI acceleration initiatives. Several strong perspectives (particularly Budget and Federal Science Policy) emphasize not only the strictness of the resolution but also the bureaucratic and timing hurdles\u2014late-year, large-scale federal moonshots are almost never rolled out without prior overt signals, and there\u2019s no evidence of ongoing preparations for such an explicit initiative. In group debate, no one offers evidence of a direct White House AGI moonshot press release meeting the resolution bar, and the lower-end probabilities are most in line with base rates and current facts. The discussions reinforced that the persistent PR and big numbers are mostly moonshot theater and fiscal optics rather than genuine new federal commitments. Thus, my already skeptical probability should shift a bit further down, as the risk window is even tighter than initially assessed.",

The strongest arguments\u2014especially from forecasters focused on federal budget procedures, AI governance standards, and innovation systems\u2014converge on the substantive point that no recent or imminent White House press release explicitly ticks all resolution boxes. Specifically, the odds of a direct, $2B+ federal-only AGI acceleration initiative, officially branded and announced under the tight time constraint, remain low. The discussion highlighted, from multiple perspectives, the hurdles imposed by the short window, institutional inertia, and the administrative tendency to blur lines with private investment. Critiques of higher probabilities were compelling in underscoring the gulf between the policy-theater of public-private \u2018moonshot\u2019 branding and genuine, appropriated federal AGI moonshots. Key points from fellow economic, budgetary, and policy process analysts were particularly persuasive that the remaining risk is essentially a wild-card, last-minute announcement\u2014always possible with Trump, but not enough to materially adjust odds upwards. In summary: arguments across disciplines converge to support, if anything, a minor downward revision. However, my initial probability (35%) already incorporated a nontrivial tail risk of surprise, so I will nudge slightly downward to reflect heightened consensus and the overwhelming lack of qualifying White House actions in the evidence.",

In research, AI advanced scientific innovation: a U.S. team developed CellTransformer, an AI model published in Nature Communications on October 7, enabling the most detailed mapping of the mouse brain to date. AI now participates in research from hypothesis generation to paper writing, though most journals still prohibit AI from being listed as an author. To test AI-generated research rigor, Stanford University hosted the first fully AI-written and AI-reviewed academic conference, the 'Artificial Intelligence Science Agent Open Conference,' on October 22, operating with minimal human oversight. In industry, competition intensified: OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, a browser centered on ChatGPT, on October 21, positioning it as a direct challenge to Google Chrome. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a 'once-in-a-decade' opportunity to reshape web browsing. On October 28, Microsoft and OpenAI announced a new final agreement to solidify their partnership, with Microsoft supporting OpenAI\u2019s board in forming a public benefit corporation (PBC) and completing capital restructuring. AI applications expanded into critical infrastructure: Italy\u2019s Ministry of Culture announced a project to develop an AI-powered security system to detect abnormal behavior near valuable artifacts, following a museum heist at the Louvre the previous day. Strategic and ecosystem development accelerated globally: the 45th Gulf Information Technology Exhibition in the Middle East showcased AI, IoT, and big data advancements, while Japan\u2019s 2025 High-Tech Expo projected AI integration into daily life. Infrastructure investment surged\u2014Morgan Stanley estimated U.S. tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft) spent up to $400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. Major deals included: OpenAI and Broadcom\u2019s joint development of a 10-gigawatt AI accelerator on October 13; a $40 billion consortium led by BlackRock acquiring Airend Data Centers from Macquarie on October 15; Meta\u2019s plan to build a 1-gigawatt AI data center in Texas by 2028; and Google\u2019s plan to restart a nuclear power plant in Iowa to power its AI infrastructure on October 27. Policy-wise, the European Commission released two AI strategies\u2014'Applying AI' and 'AI in Science'\u2014in early October to accelerate AI adoption in European industry and science. China issued the 'Guidance on Deployment of Large AI Models in Government Affairs' to provide direction for AI model implementation in public administration. Despite rapid adoption, risks emerged: China\u2019s China Internet Network Information Center reported 515 million users of generative AI by June 2025, indicating deep integration into daily life. However, the European Broadcasting Union found on October 22 that about half of AI assistants\u2019 responses to news queries were inaccurate. On October 24, a study on arXiv tested 11 large language models and found AI exhibited 'flattery' 50% more than humans, potentially compromising accuracy. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law on October 13 requiring AI chatbot operators to implement 'critical' safeguards, such as preventing interactions on suicide or self-harm with minors or vulnerable groups. On October 16, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned that while AI boosts productivity, it could also widen inequality within and between nations, urging stronger policy responses.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1893892941_70e2834d02001v0gm.html?from=society)\n\n**AI Weekly Roundup**\nThe AI economy reached a new milestone in November 2025, marked by Nvidia becoming the world's first company to achieve a $5 trillion market capitalization, reflecting strong investor confidence in its central role in AI infrastructure. This surge was driven by global demand for advanced AI chips, with Nvidia expanding its influence in Asia through major deals with South Korean corporations and potential US-China trade talks that could allow sales of its Blackwell processors to China. The US and South Korea are preparing a strategic agreement to boost cooperation in AI, quantum computing, and semiconductor supply chains. Meanwhile, escalating AI spending is raising investor concerns: Meta plans to raise at least $25 billion via bond sales to fund AI infrastructure, while Microsoft faces growing local opposition to its data center expansions. Amazon's AWS reported its fastest growth since 2022, fueled by AI initiatives, and Google secured a 25-year carbon-free power deal with the reopened Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa. On the corporate side, OpenAI transitioned to a for-profit public benefit corporation, enabling future capital raises and an IPO, and established a new governance panel to assess Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) achievement. GitHub launched 'Agent HQ' to manage third-party AI coding agents, and OpenAI enhanced its Sora video generator with reusable character cameos and video stitching. A 2026 partnership with PayPal will enable payments via ChatGPT through 'Instant Checkout'. In consumer applications, Meta will integrate vast amounts of AI-generated content into its recommendation systems, Canva accelerated its AI feature rollout, and Pinterest introduced an AI shopping assistant for conversational searches. Labor disruption intensified as Amazon cut 14,000 corporate jobs, and former McKinsey consultants are now training AI to replace their roles. California State University invited tech companies to co-develop AI integration plans for campuses. Ethical concerns emerged with 1X launching pre-orders for its $20,000 Neo humanoid robot, which learns chores via human teleoperation, and Character.AI implementing a ban on users under 18 to address safety risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 03:01 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@sean.spaniel/ai-weekly-roundup-778e79b0d1d7)\n\n**Sam Altman Just Dropped an Exact Date for AGI**\nDuring the October 2025 OpenAI Q&A livestream, Sam Altman and Jakob Pachocki announced a specific timeline for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), marking a shift from vague predictions to a concrete project plan. The timeline includes: September 2026 for an 'intern-level AI research assistant' capable of helping build the next AI, and March 2028 for a 'legitimate AI researcher'\u2014an AI capable of conducting independent, high-level research. This milestone signifies the potential start of recursive self-improvement, triggering an 'intelligence explosion' where AI accelerates its own development. The announcement, backed by OpenAI\u2019s $1.4 trillion infrastructure plans, is presented not as a prediction but as a target. The article notes that missing this date carries significant strategic risk, with even major investors like Mark Zuckerberg reportedly willing to misallocate hundreds of billions to avoid falling behind.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 05:23 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/write-your-world/sam-altman-just-dropped-an-exact-date-for-agi-2619490b435c)\n\n**\"Manhattan II\"  --  Former CIA Officer Buck Sexton Exposes the Hidden Race With China**\nFormer CIA officer Buck Sexton warns of a critical global race for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which he labels 'Manhattan II,' in a press release published on October 31, 2025. According to Sexton, the United States is now engaged in a high-stakes technological arms race with China, comparable in scale to the original Manhattan Project. He asserts that whoever achieves ASI first will gain permanent global dominance in military, economic, and geopolitical power. Sexton criticizes former President Biden for issuing Executive Order 14110, which he claims stifled AI innovation by imposing excessive regulations on top scientists. In contrast, he praises President Trump for immediately repealing the order on his first day back in office and launching a new, aggressive initiative. The 'Manhattan II' project is estimated to involve $2.2 trillion in funding, distributed as follows: $500 billion for AI infrastructure and data networks, $280 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, $175 billion for an AI-powered defense shield, and $1.4 trillion for advanced energy systems. Sexton claims China is already operating at wartime production speed, capable of manufacturing 500,000 AI-powered drones per month, with over a million already deployed. He warns that China is leveraging American technology to threaten U.S. national security. Sexton frames the race as America\u2019s 'last chance' to reclaim global leadership and secure its future. He positions 'Manhattan II' as a pivotal moment for America\u2019s economic and military revival through innovation. Buck Sexton, a former CIA counter-terrorism officer who debriefed President George W. Bush during the Iraq War and was hand-picked to co-host a top-rated radio program with over 15 million followers, uses his national security background to advocate for urgent action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/31/3178399/0/en/Manhattan-II-Former-CIA-Officer-Buck-Sexton-Exposes-the-Hidden-Race-With-China.html)\n\n**U.S. Developments: Trump\u2019s Refugee Plan Sparks Debate, OpenAI Launches Aardvark, China Agrees to Major U.S. Agricultural Purchases**\nOn Thursday, October 31, 2025, the United States witnessed a wave of political, economic, and technological developments. The Trump administration announced a controversial refugee policy limiting admissions to 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year\u2014the lowest in modern history\u2014prioritizing white South Africans under Executive Order 14204, citing humanitarian and national interests and targeting individuals 'exposed to unlawful or unjust discrimination' in their home countries. The move has drawn scrutiny for explicitly favoring a demographic group not previously prioritized in refugee policies, reflecting broader efforts to tighten immigration control under a 'merit-based humanitarian' framework. In technology, OpenAI launched Aardvark, an autonomous AI-powered cybersecurity researcher driven by GPT-5, designed to detect and patch software vulnerabilities. Described as a 'breakthrough in AI and security research,' Aardvark is currently in private beta to refine its real-world capabilities before wider rollout. Industry experts view it as a pivotal step in integrating AI and cybersecurity, a trend central to corporate tech strategy. In trade, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins confirmed that China will purchase 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans in 2025 following a meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, with additional commitments to buy 25 million tons annually from 2026 to 2028, plus sorghum and hardwood. Rollins hailed the deal as 'HUGE,' stating it would channel funds 'directly to American farms, American workers, and American families,' aiding recovery after years of trade volatility. In financial markets, Meta Platforms Inc. shares dropped over 11%, reaching their lowest level in four months, after reporting a sharp 83% year-over-year decline in earnings per share to $1.05\u2014well below analyst expectations\u2014sparking investor concern over rising AI-related costs. The broader markets followed, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 1%, the Nasdaq Composite dropping 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 0.2%. While Alphabet shares rose 3% on strong results, declines in Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia triggered a broad rotation out of tech stocks. Conversely, bank and healthcare stocks\u2014including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Eli Lilly\u2014rose on strong earnings and favorable outlooks.\nOriginal language: da-DK\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Invezz - Danish](https://invezz.com/da/nyheder/2025/10/30/amerikansk-sammenfatning-trumps-flygtningeloft-udloser-debat-openai-afslorer-aardvark-kina-handelsaftale/)\n\n**Global AI Landscape in October 2025: Breakthroughs, Strategic Expansion, and Emerging Risks**\nIn October 2025, global artificial intelligence (AI) development continued to show multi-point breakthroughs and cross-disciplinary integration, driving paradigm shifts across multiple fields while raising growing concerns about challenges and risks.

The Trump administration announced a controversial refugee policy limiting admissions to 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year\u2014the lowest in modern history\u2014prioritizing white South Africans under Executive Order 14204, citing humanitarian and national interests and targeting individuals 'exposed to unlawful or unjust discrimination' in their home countries. The move has drawn scrutiny for explicitly favoring a demographic group not previously prioritized in refugee policies, reflecting broader efforts to tighten immigration control under a 'merit-based humanitarian' framework. In technology, OpenAI launched Aardvark, an autonomous AI-powered cybersecurity researcher driven by GPT-5, designed to detect and patch software vulnerabilities. Described as a 'breakthrough in AI and security research,' Aardvark is currently in private beta to refine its real-world capabilities before wider rollout. Industry experts view it as a pivotal step in integrating AI and cybersecurity, a trend central to corporate tech strategy. In trade, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins confirmed that China will purchase 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans in 2025 following a meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, with additional commitments to buy 25 million tons annually from 2026 to 2028, plus sorghum and hardwood. Rollins hailed the deal as 'HUGE,' stating it would channel funds 'directly to American farms, American workers, and American families,' aiding recovery after years of trade volatility. In financial markets, Meta Platforms Inc. shares dropped over 11%, reaching their lowest level in four months, after reporting a sharp 83% year-over-year decline in earnings per share to $1.05\u2014well below analyst expectations\u2014sparking investor concern over rising AI-related costs. The broader markets followed, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 1%, the Nasdaq Composite dropping 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 0.2%. While Alphabet shares rose 3% on strong results, declines in Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia triggered a broad rotation out of tech stocks. Conversely, bank and healthcare stocks\u2014including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Eli Lilly\u2014rose on strong earnings and favorable outlooks.\nOriginal language: da-DK\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Invezz - Danish](https://invezz.com/da/nyheder/2025/10/30/amerikansk-sammenfatning-trumps-flygtningeloft-udloser-debat-openai-afslorer-aardvark-kina-handelsaftale/)\n\n**What oil monarchies can bring to the AI table**\nThe United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) and Saudi Arabia are positioning themselves as key players in the global artificial intelligence (AI) race, leveraging their oil wealth, stable governments, and access to cheap energy to attract massive investments. Following a May 2024 visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.A.E. announced plans for a $500 billion Stargate AI complex and promised $1.4 trillion in U.S. investments. The U.S. Commerce Department recently approved the export of 500,000 advanced Nvidia microchips to the U.A.E., lifting prior national security restrictions. OpenAI praised the region's 'democratic values, open markets, and trusted partnerships,' while Blackstone signed a $3 billion deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Humain to build data centers. The U.A.E. has demonstrated AI capability with the release of K2 Think, a budget-friendly alternative to ChatGPT, and has led the region in AI governance since appointing the world\u2019s first AI minister in 2017. Geopolitical conditions favor cooperation: the Trump administration\u2019s push to dominate the 'AI stack' reduces fears of chip leakage to China, and regional instability\u2014such as Iran\u2019s diminished capacity after Israeli-U.S. strikes\u2014creates a favorable backdrop. The Gulf\u2019s central location, within a 2,000-mile radius of half the world\u2019s population, makes it strategically positioned to serve energy-constrained markets like India. However, progress has lagged: the approved Nvidia chips will only be used by U.S. firms like Oracle operating in the U.A.E., not directly sold to Emirati or Saudi entities. Analysts warn of a significant profit gap, as standalone data centers may not generate sufficient returns without control over upstream software and services, which remain likely to be dominated by Silicon Valley. Security risks persist, with concerns over the vulnerability of high-value infrastructure to conflict or attack, a risk unfamiliar to major tech investors. According to Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute, the ambitious bilateral deals have not advanced as quickly as expected. Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute calls the chip approval a 'test case' for future cooperation. Matt Gertken of BCA Research predicts that while the region has strong comparative advantages, the economic viability of these projects remains uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 01:41 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/global/what-oil-monarchies-can-bring-to-the-ai-table-11761874109207.html)\n\n**AI Giants Turn Eyes to South Korea Amid Global Tech Race and Strategic Investments**\nMajor AI companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and NVIDIA, are intensifying their focus on South Korea amid significant technological and investment developments. On October 1, OpenAI announced a partnership with Samsung and SK Hynix to support the $500 billion 'Stargate' initiative\u2014co-led by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle\u2014aimed at expanding AI infrastructure globally, with a 'Korean version' of the project. SK Hynix reported record quarterly profits, with operating income up 119% year-on-year and exceeding 10 trillion KRW for the first time, driven by strong demand for AI-grade memory chips, and confirmed its 2026 chip capacity is fully booked. The collaboration includes telecom infrastructure, data center expansion, and floating data centers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, praising Korea as having 'all the conditions to become a global AI leader' and noting it has the highest number of ChatGPT paid subscribers outside the U.S. On October 29, the South Korean presidential office revealed Amazon plans to invest at least $5 billion in South Korea by 2031 to build AI data centers. President Lee reiterated Korea\u2019s goal to become one of the world\u2019s top three AI leaders and to position Seoul as Asia\u2019s AI hub. The 2025 APEC summit in Korea drew global attention: U.S. President Trump and President Lee reached a preliminary trade deal, with tariffs reduced to 15% and Korea committing to invest at least $35 billion in the U.S. The 'Technology Prosperity Agreement' includes joint AI policy frameworks, AI export coordination, secure pharmaceutical and biotech supply chains, and space exploration cooperation. On October 30, U.S. and Chinese leaders met in Busan, focusing on export controls for critical technologies like rare earths and semiconductors. NVIDIA, impacted by U.S. export restrictions, has seen its Chinese market share drop to zero since Q2 2025, despite previously holding 95% of China\u2019s AI chip market. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized at the GTC Washington event on October 28 that the U.S. must lead the AI race to ensure innovation and governance remain rooted in American technology and values, calling AI the 'Apollo moment' of this generation. He also urged the U.S. to allow AI chip exports to China to retain developer engagement, warning that bans risk losing markets and self-harm. According to Bloomberg, Huang plans to announce new partnerships with Samsung, SK Hynix, and Hyundai during the APEC CEO Summit on October 31, including supplying GPUs for South Korea\u2019s planned AI data centers. South Korea aims to spend $3 billion by 2030 to purchase approximately 200,000 high-performance GPUs. As a result, Korea has become the central focus of global AI investment and technological competition in late October 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 04:50 AM\nSource:[tmtpost.com](https://www.tmtpost.com/7743467.html)\n\n**Altman unveils trillion-dollar AI vision as OpenAI eyes massive expansion**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled a trillion-dollar vision for AI infrastructure, outlining plans to develop 30 gigawatts of computing capacity at a projected cost of $1.4 trillion. This marks a pivotal shift from OpenAI\u2019s origins as a research-focused nonprofit to a corporate entity structured for massive public capital raising, potentially culminating in an initial public offering (IPO). Altman emphasized the need for OpenAI to scale rapidly, aiming to add 1 gigawatt of compute capacity per week\u2014equivalent to over $40 billion in capital costs per gigawatt. He also announced the expansion of the Stargate project, initially a $500 billion initiative with Oracle, SoftBank, Nvidia, and CoreWeave, now tripled to 30 GW of data center capacity. To support this, Altman stated OpenAI must eventually generate hundreds of billions in annual revenue, requiring growth at 10 times its current pace. The newly formed OpenAI Foundation will oversee mission-driven efforts, including AI for disease cures and 'AI resilience,' though funding sources remain unclear. Despite criticism over circular deals with public companies like Nvidia and concerns about an AI bubble, Altman remains focused on scaling. He earns only $76,000 annually from OpenAI, with wealth derived from tech investments. Former employees have backed Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit accusing Altman of abandoning OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit mission.

This plan, enabled by a new financial agreement with Microsoft, includes the goal of adding one gigawatt of computing power weekly. The initiative is part of the Stargate project \u2014 a $500 billion venture involving Oracle, Nvidia, SoftBank, and CoreWeave \u2014 announced at the White House in January and described by Altman as a job creator that would 'rebuild America's digital backbone.' Despite industry optimism, the plan raises concerns about financing, control, and global power imbalances. OpenAI\u2019s revenue is projected to reach $20 billion by 2025, but Altman\u2019s target requires a tenfold increase. The company\u2019s restructuring now allows freer fundraising, with an initial public offering deemed 'the most likely path.' Altman\u2019s rise mirrors Silicon Valley\u2019s top tech leaders, but his focus on AI infrastructure marks a shift from consumer products to foundational intelligence systems. Critics, including Elon Musk, accuse OpenAI of abandoning its original nonprofit mission for profit, citing governance issues and ethical risks. Altman\u2019s brief ousting in 2023 and subsequent reinstatement \u2014 now being dramatized in the film 'Artificial' starring Andrew Garfield \u2014 highlight the cultural weight of the AI era. The geopolitical stakes are high, as AI reshapes national security, finance, and democracy. Prediction markets integrated with AI, such as those on Trump Media\u2019s Truth Social, signal the fusion of AI, finance, and social media, raising ethical concerns over manipulation, data privacy, and behavioral commodification.

The investment will come through a series of companies and will include the creation of new data centers, expansion of power generation capacity, and upgrading of the electrical grid, as well as the launch of specialized training and professional development programs in artificial intelligence. Trump will participate in the event alongside Senator David McCormick, who is hosting the inaugural edition of the Energy and Innovation Summit in Pennsylvania, at Carnegie Mellon University. The event is expected to attract leaders from the artificial intelligence and energy sectors, including up to 60 CEOs. Among the expected participants are Larry Fink from BlackRock, Alex Karp from Palantir Technologies, Dario Amodei from Anthropic, Darren Woods from Exxon Mobil, and Mike Wirth from Chevron. According to Jake Murphy, spokesperson for McCormick, John Gray, CEO of Blackstone, will announce a $25 billion project to develop energy infrastructure and data centers, and launch a joint project to increase power generation capacity, which is expected to create 6,000 jobs per year in the construction sector and 3,000 permanent jobs. Blackstone declined to comment, while Axios published details of the summit earlier. US commitment to AI superiority The announcements expected on Tuesday are the latest step taken by Trump to fulfill his pledge to ensure American leadership in artificial intelligence. Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has adopted a comprehensive strategy that includes attracting private investments, relaxing regulatory restrictions, and speeding up the issuance of necessary licenses for new projects. Earlier this year, Trump announced a $100 billion investment in artificial intelligence data centers by SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle. The Trump administration also lifted restrictions on AI chips imposed during the Biden era, as part of a broader plan to boost American innovation and facilitate access to advanced technology for US allies. These moves aim to keep the United States ahead of China in the AI race. Beijing has invested heavily in this emerging sector, and the Chinese startup DeepSeek has raised concerns among investors on Wall Street after unveiling its AI model 'R1', which showed the possibility of developing AI at very low costs. Data centers and increasing demand for electricity Trump and his administration have also emphasized the importance of meeting another priority for the technology sector: ensuring the United States has enough electricity to power AI-intensive data centers. According to their view, providing sufficient electricity is a matter of national security, essential to ensuring America's continued superiority over its global competitors in the AI race. By 2035, data centers are expected to account for 8.6% of the US electricity demand, more than double their current share of 3.5%, according to Bloomberg NEF data. In this context, the Trump administration has pointed out that expanding reliance on coal-fired power plants, as well as natural gas and nuclear power, is necessary to support this growing demand. It has also warned that failing to take these steps could lead to potential power outages in the future. The US Energy Department has used emergency powers to keep two power plants from being shut down, and hinted at the possibility of further federal intervention. The political significance of choosing Pennsylvania By hosting the event in Pennsylvania, Trump and McCormick highlight the political importance of accelerating the development of artificial intelligence. The key state is a 'battleground' in the electoral arena, where Biden won in 2020, and Trump regained in 2024. The event comes after the completion of a deal between Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel and US Steel, headquartered in Pittsburgh, for $14.1 billion. The deal ended a contentious takeover dispute that had intersected with US politics for several months before ultimately receiving Trump's support. The deal is expected to boost local steel production and protect thousands of jobs. Both Trump and Biden had sought to win the support of labor unions, while the United Steelworkers union opposed the deal.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 08:08 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2025/07/15/article_2763956.html)\n\n**Trump to Announce $70 Billion in Investments in AI and Energy**\nUS President Donald Trump is expected to announce $70 billion in investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and energy in the state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, July 15. This initiative is part of the White House plan to accelerate the development of technology in the country. The investments from various companies will include new data centers, expansion of energy generation, and improvements to network infrastructure, as well as AI training and internship programs. Trump will be accompanied by Republican Senator David McCormick at the first Energy and Innovation Summit in Pennsylvania at Carnegie Mellon University, where leaders in AI and energy, including 60 executives, will attend. Jon Gray, of Blackstone Inc., is expected to announce a $25 billion project for the development of data center and energy infrastructure. A joint venture will also be launched to increase energy generation, creating 6,000 construction jobs annually and 3,000 permanent jobs, according to Jake Murphy, McCormick's spokesperson. The announcements may represent a significant step by Trump in his promise to seek US leadership in AI. Since the beginning of his second term, the President has adopted a comprehensive approach that includes attracting private sector investments, relaxing regulations, and accelerating the licensing process for new projects. Trump has already announced a $100 billion investment in AI data centers from SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI Inc., and Oracle Corp. The government has also repealed restrictions on the use of AI chips, established by the Joe Biden administration, as part of a broader effort to drive innovation in the country and facilitate access to advanced technology for US allies. The measures aim to keep the US ahead of China in the AI race. Beijing has invested significantly in this emerging technology, and the Chinese startup DeepSeek shook investors on Wall Street in January with its innovative R1 model, suggesting that AI could be developed at a much lower cost. Trump and other government officials have also emphasized the importance of meeting another priority of the technology industry: ensuring that the US has enough energy to operate AI data centers, which consume a lot of energy. In their view, adequate electricity supply is linked to national security, essential for keeping the US ahead of global competitors in the race to dominate AI.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 14, 2025 03:19 PM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/mundo/trump-vai-anunciar-us-70-bilhoes-de-investimento-em-ia-e-energia-diz-agencia/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a diverse range of expert perspectives\u2014including federal policy, budgeting, AI governance, political science theories, science and technology studies, and economics\u2014there is broad agreement that the White House has thus far not issued an official press release explicitly committing at least $2 billion in federal funding for an AGI acceleration 'moonshot' as required by the resolution criteria. While the Trump administration and private sector have made numerous highly publicized, multi-billion dollar announcements (e.g., Stargate, nuclear energy for AI, joint ventures), these are typically structured as public-private partnerships, with unclear proportions of direct federal funding or ambiguous language failing to meet the narrow requirements of a government-only moonshot for AGI. Several experts highlight the political incentives and intense US-China rivalry as drivers increasing the probability of a dramatic, last-minute White House announcement, but they also note strong historical, procedural, and fiscal barriers: such federal initiatives are rare, generally require extended approvals and clear branding, and are not commonly introduced abruptly near the end of the year. The group identifies that most recent investments focus on AI infrastructure and energy, are often led by private industry, or employ regulatory/indirect support, all of which diminish the likelihood of a 'Yes' resolution. While probabilities offered range from about 8% to 45%, the consensus is that a qualifying White House AGI moonshot initiative remains unlikely within the short window left in 2025, barring a major focusing event or policy shock. The mean of the forecast probabilities hovers near one-third, weighted up by geopolitical pressure and political showmanship, but ultimately tempered by timing, ambiguity in White House communication, and the persistent predominance of public-private partnerships over unequivocal federal AGI moonshots.",
