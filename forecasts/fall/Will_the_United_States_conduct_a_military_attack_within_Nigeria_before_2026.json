Under mounting domestic political pressure and perhaps in the waning days of his administration, Trump orders a limited, targeted drone or missile strike against a Boko Haram or ISWAP camp inside Nigeria, justified as a counter-terrorism action. The strike is announced as a warning, calibrated to avoid major escalation and civilian casualties, possibly coordinated with token notification of the Nigerian government\u2014 but still unilaterally executed by the US and reported by credible sources as a US military action inside Nigerian territory.",

US ROE and legal policy make it hard to justify a kinetic strike absent an imminent threat/attack on Americans, or a UN/legally recognized genocide, neither of which is credibly present. Trump\u2019s rhetoric signals possible escalation but functions as political signaling to a domestic audience; similar patterns have occurred in Venezuela, Iran, and elsewhere, with tough talk but ultimately no follow-through owing to realism from DOD, State, and legal advisers. While there could be more covert support, the likelihood of an overt US attack between now and the end of 2025 remains low unless a massive massacre occurs, is credibly blamed on the Nigerian government or their utter inaction, and global outrage creates cross-institutional willingness to act. Considering all structural, operational, legal, and political constraints, a probability estimate above 10% would exaggerate the risk\u2014yet the level of official threat and crisis atmosphere (unusual even by recent standards) raises this marginally above the historical baseline.

The base rate for US attacks in large, non-failed states amid complex civil strife (outside of Afghanistan/Iraq-style wars) is extremely low\u2014even under high-profile humanitarian pressure (e.g., Syria, Sudan, DRC, Myanmar). The logistical and diplomatic obstacles to projecting force into Nigeria are severe (no nearby bases, large population, complex terrain, hostile regional/diplomatic climate, significant risk to civilians). Trump\u2019s pattern is to threaten, not act, unless a triggering event is so dramatic it presents a unique window for a small symbolic action. While I believe the odds are higher than normal due to the recent dramatic rhetoric and some planning signals (ordering DoD to prepare possible action), the probability is still modest given prevailing incentives, constraints, and history. Barring a catalytic mass atrocity in the next 6 weeks that 'forces the President\u2019s hand,' the status quo of 'all bark, no bite' will hold.",

While the rhetoric is unusually escalatory, both the AU and Nigeria have strongly and publicly rejected the genocide framing, calling for caution and warning against violation of sovereignty. Intelligence, operational, and diplomatic barriers remain high, especially with a reduced US military footprint in West Africa. Recent US history shows a gap between rhetorical threat and kinetic follow-through, particularly from President Trump, unless US citizens are attacked or a shock event occurs.

As of now, even with DoD preparations, the balance of factors\u2014historical precedent, operational logistics, diplomatic posture, and likely bureaucratic resistance\u2014strongly disfavors a strike in the next 1.5 months. However, the probability cannot be placed at zero due to both the present posturing and uncertainty inherent in late 2025\u2014so I overweight slightly for risk of a one-off drone or air strike.

However, I remain convinced that the uniquely repeated and highly publicized threats, open tasking of the Pentagon, and pre-election context create a non-trivial possibility of a symbolic strike (drone, precision air attack), raising risk somewhat above the pure historic base rate. Still, in dialogue with the group, I accept my previous estimate\u2014triple the historical base rate\u2014was slightly overweighted for the exceptional rhetorical environment.

Discussion of a possible 'symbolic' strike (Reaper drone or SOF action) does not override the near unanimity of risk-averse institutional, logistical, and normative factors. While several forecasters (including myself) gave a modest uptick in probability due to unprecedented rhetoric and DoD tasking, critiques of the higher-end estimates for overweighting rhetorical noise were persuasive.

I found these critiques convincing, especially in the context of: (1) total absence of observable real-world military movement, (2) very short lead time, (3) previously similar situations that produced only more sanctions or diplomatic pressure, (4) universal regional and diplomatic resistance, and (5) the evidence that even high-level DoD planning is not matched by deployment or imminent actionable intent. My own factors for \u2018raising\u2019 the risk (tail event, single symbolic strike, political imperative) were rooted in scenarios that have not yet started to materialize and are explicitly discounted by observable indicators and precedent.

The group deliberation reinforced\u2014through diverse disciplinary angles\u2014that absent a catalyzing, world-shifting atrocity, the probability remains flat and low, with higher numbers unsupported by concrete, non-rhetorical signals.

The possibility of a 'rupture event' like a sudden mass-casualty atrocity fueling a token strike is real, but that scenario remains highly contingent and unsupported by current indicators.

While many forecasts initially edged up slightly from base rates due to unprecedented rhetoric and declared DoD readiness, the critiques largely converged on the risk of overweighting rhetorical tail risk in absence of concrete movement: no asset redeployment, no coalition activity, and persistent UN/AU/Nigeria resistance. My own analysis already placed significant emphasis on the inertia of the status quo and the rarity of US kinetic action in similar contexts. On deeper reflection, my original 7% is slightly high relative to the most compelling arguments: a 3-5% probability appropriately reflects base rates, the absence of operational signals, and the temporal proximity to question closure.

In a November 1, 2025, post on Truth Social, Trump stated he is instructing the Department of War to prepare for possible action, describing any future attack as 'fast, fierce, and sweet'\u2014mirroring the brutality of the attackers. He also called on Congressman Riley Moore of West Virginia to provide a report on the situation, citing estimates that over 50,000 Christians have been killed since 2009, with more than 7,000 deaths in 2025 alone. Moore, who has long highlighted the crisis, described Nigeria as 'the most dangerous country on Earth for a Christian' and identified three main groups responsible: Boko Haram, the Islamic State in West Africa, and the Fulani pastoralist community. Although these groups have different objectives, Moore asserts they are united by a common goal: the genocide of Christians. He criticized the Nigerian government for 'practically closing its eyes' to the violence and emphasized that U.S. security assistance has not been used to combat these terrorist groups. Trump, following Moore\u2019s advocacy, redesignated Nigeria as a 'Country of Particular Concern' under the International Religious Freedom Act, unlocking 15 tools including aid cuts, security assistance suspension, and sanctions. Moore stressed that the goal is not regime change but targeted action to stop the persecution, and he believes this can be achieved without direct military intervention. The article was published on November 13, 2025, by Gazeta do Povo.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:19 PM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/ideias/trump-massacre-cristaos-nigeria/)\n\n**There's no genocide in Nigeria, says AU chief after Trump military threats**\nThe African Union Commission chairperson, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, stated on November 12, 2025, at the United Nations in New York, that there is no genocide occurring in northern Nigeria, rejecting claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump that 'very large numbers' of Christians were being killed in the country. Youssouf emphasized that the situation in northern Nigeria differs from atrocities seen in Sudan or eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and urged caution, saying, 'Think twice before... making such statements.' He noted that the first victims of the extremist Islamist group Boko Haram are Muslims, not Christians, citing that human rights experts have confirmed most Boko Haram victims have been Muslim. Trump had earlier in November 2025 demanded the Defense Department prepare for potential 'fast' military action if Nigeria fails to stop the killings of Christians, and threatened to 'stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria' and possibly 'go into that now disgraced country, guns-a-blazing, to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists.' Nigeria's Foreign Ministry responded by affirming its commitment to fighting violent extremism and maintaining its alliance with the United States, stating it 'will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion.' Nigeria, home to 200 ethnic groups practicing Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions, has a history of peaceful coexistence, though periodic violence has occurred, often fueled by ethnic divisions or competition over scarce resources.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 10:16 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/theres-no-genocide-in-nigeria-says-au-chief-after-trump-military-threats)\n\n**Will Trump attack Nigeria?**\nPresident Donald Trump has threatened military intervention in Nigeria unless it stops the killings of Christians, stating in a Truth Social video that the U.S. would 'do things to Nigeria that Nigeria is not going to be happy about' and 'go into that now-disgraced country guns-a-blazing.' However, the article argues that the U.S. has no vital national security interest in Nigeria, despite a strong humanitarian concern. The violence is primarily carried out by Boko Haram, the Islamic State in West Africa Province, and Fulani tribal militants, with estimates suggesting over 52,000 Christians killed and more than 10,000 churches burned since 2009, including over 7,000 in the first eight months of 2025. The Nigerian government denies targeting Christians, claiming terrorists attack all who oppose their ideology. An adviser to President Bola Tinubu stated that while U.S. assistance is welcome, it must respect Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity\u2014something any military incursion would violate. Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa with 237 million people, is divided roughly 50-50 between Christians and Muslims, with 40% under 14 years old and millions of displaced Christians living in camps. The article questions the feasibility of U.S. military action: deploying aircraft carriers near Nigeria would risk civilian casualties due to terrorists hiding in schools and hospitals; ground operations would require massive logistics, intelligence, and time, and could provoke the Nigerian government. Special forces and Marine deployments would face intelligence gaps and long-term commitments, with no guarantee of success. The article concludes that Nigeria would become a quagmire, with terrorists relocating to northern Nigeria or neighboring countries. It criticizes Trump\u2019s pattern of unfulfilled threats\u2014against Putin, the Taliban, and Maduro\u2014arguing that such rhetoric undermines American credibility and risks American lives without strategic justification. The author urges hope that Trump will shift focus and avoid action, emphasizing that the U.S. should not risk lives where there is no vital national security interest.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 05:09 PM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/12/trump-attack-nigeria/)\n\n**Jihad at Lake Chad: Why Trump Threatens Invasion of Nigeria**\nThe situation in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is rapidly deteriorating, marked by escalating conflict between two major jihadist groups: Boko Haram* and Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP)*. The conflict, rooted in ideological differences since 2015, has intensified into a violent struggle for territory, resources, and influence around Lake Chad, which spans Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. Boko Haram*, led by Abubakar Shekau, split from ISWAP* after Shekau rejected the leadership of Abu Musab al-Barnawi in 2016. Boko Haram* adheres to a radical takfiri ideology, targeting Muslims who do not join the jihad, while ISWAP* has sought to gain local support by avoiding attacks on mosques and markets. The conflict entered a new phase in December 2022, with ISWAP* launching attacks that killed around 56 fighters. By 2024, Boko Haram* had driven ISWAP* southward into Nigeria, conducting punitive operations against civilians suspected of sympathizing with rivals. In May, nearly 100 people were killed in Malam Karamti and Kwattatandashi; in late October\u2013early November, Boko Haram* attacked ISWAP* positions on Tumbun-Gini Island, killing 50 and seizing weapons and explosives. The group aims to control rich fishing resources, strategic islands, and trade routes. Christian communities face severe persecution: from January to August 2025, at least 7,087 Christians were killed (32 per day), and 7,899 were abducted. In Benue State, Amnesty International** reported at least 6,896 deaths from January 2024 to May 2025, with over 500,000 internally displaced persons. Notable massacres occurred in Sanke and Eveta, where 72 and 100\u2013280 people were killed, respectively. Since 2009, approximately 125,000 Christians have been killed, 19,000 churches destroyed, and 1,100 Christian communities displaced. A separate conflict between Muslim Fulani herders and Christian farmers in central Nigeria is driven by competition for water and pasture, not religion. In early November 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Nigeria\u2019s leadership of failing to protect Christians, threatening immediate military intervention. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed this, stating: 'Either Nigeria protects Christians, or we destroy the Islamist terrorists responsible.' Trump\u2019s actions are driven by three goals: consolidating support among evangelical Christians (25% of the U.S. electorate), reasserting U.S. influence in Africa (due to Nigeria\u2019s oil, gas, and critical minerals vital for green tech), and diverting attention from domestic crises. The Pentagon has developed three scenarios: a large-scale naval and air campaign, targeted drone strikes using MQ-9 Reapers and MQ-1 Predators, and enhanced intelligence sharing and joint operations. However, high-ranking Pentagon officials admit that limited operations won\u2019t significantly reduce violence or degrade terrorist capabilities, requiring a full-scale campaign like in Iraq or Afghanistan\u2014something the White House currently rejects. Nigeria faces a dire dilemma: unable to counter the jihadists alone, yet facing U.S. political leverage exploiting the crisis.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 03:53 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0421\u041d\u0413 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 - \u0418\u0410 REGNUM](https://regnum.ru/article/4000463)\n\n**[OPINION] Before Trump Drops His Bombs - Simon Kolawole**\nSimon Kolawole's opinion piece critiques former U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cut all aid to Nigeria and potentially launch a military strike if the government continues to allow the killing of Christians. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, demanded that Nigeria act swiftly against 'Islamic Terrorists' responsible for 'horrible atrocities' and instructed the U.S. Department of War to prepare for possible action, using aggressive language such as 'guns-a-blazing,' 'fast, vicious, and sweet.' However, Kolawole notes that Trump did not mention 'Christian genocide'\u2014a term popularized by the NGO InterSociety, linked to the separatist IPOB\u2014despite its widespread use in American lobbying circles. The author argues that the Nigerian security crisis is multidimensional: (1) terrorism (Boko Haram), (2) insurgency, (3) banditry and kidnapping, (4) herders-farmers clashes, and (5) communal conflicts. He emphasizes that Trump\u2019s focus on 'Islamic Terrorists' misrepresents the complex reality\u2014especially in the Middle Belt, where conflicts are primarily over land and grazing rights, not religion. Kolawole warns that military intervention would not resolve these deep-rooted issues, citing the U.S. failure in Afghanistan as evidence that terrorism cannot be 'completely wiped out' with speed and force. He also questions the feasibility of 'Operation exNigeria' (a hypothetical breakup of Nigeria), noting that Christians are spread across northern states, not just the southeast. Additionally, the piece highlights China\u2019s cautious stance on Nigeria, rejecting foreign interference, while also addressing unrelated topics: celebrating two journalists\u2019 60th birthdays, criticizing FIFA\u2019s appointment of South African referees for a Nigeria-Gabon match, and questioning a proposed ban on petrol vehicles in favor of electric ones\u2014pointing out the irony of needing petrol generators to charge EVs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 06:07 AM\nSource:[reubenabati.com.ng](https://reubenabati.com.ng/opinion/opinion-before-trump-drops-his-bombs-simon-kolawole)\n\n**Nigeria Brutalizes Peaceful Protesters Demanding Protection from Jihadis, Killing One**\nOn November 13, 2025, Nigerian military forces attacked peaceful protesters in Katsina State, a predominantly Muslim region in northern Nigeria, who were demanding government protection from ongoing jihadist violence. The protest followed a 'fresh attack by bandits' that killed at least one person and led to the abduction of 17 residents across three communities\u2014marking the third such attack in a week. According to the Vanguard and Daily Trust, residents, mostly youths, blocked the Funtua-Katsina highway to protest the government\u2019s failure to secure the area. Security forces arrived and killed one protester, with residents alleging that soldiers shot two dead and injured two others. The victims, primarily farmers, reportedly pay 'taxes' to the attackers\u2014consistent with historical patterns of Fulani herders imposing jizya-like levies on Christian communities under Sharia-influenced governance in Katsina. Despite evidence of genocidal attacks by Fulani jihadists, the Nigerian government, under President Bola Tinubu, denies religiously motivated violence, attributing the conflict to economic instability and climate change. The government has reportedly pressured media and citizens to avoid identifying the attackers as Fulani or Muslim, using terms like 'bandits' or 'unknown gunmen.' This suppression has been criticized by religious leaders, including Father Remigius Ihyula, who stated that the government prevents acknowledgment of the attackers' identity. The situation intensified after U.S. President Donald Trump designated Nigeria a Country of Particular Concern (CPC) for religious freedom on October 31, 2025, citing the genocide of Christians by Fulani jihadists. Trump responded by threatening U.S. military intervention 'guns-a-blazing' if Nigeria continues to deny the reality. In retaliation, Nigerian media reported that local Christians are being threatened with arrest for speaking out\u2014highlighting a climate of fear just days before the violent crackdown on protesters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/africa/2025/11/13/nigeria-brutalizes-peaceful-protesters-demanding-protection-from-jihadis-killing-one/)\n\n**Trump's Threats and U.S. Response to the Persecution of Christians in Nigeria**\nPresident Donald Trump has responded to the ongoing massacre of Christians in Nigeria by threatening to cut all U.S. aid to Nigeria and potentially launch a military intervention 'with weapons in hand' if the Nigerian government fails to stop the violence. In a November 1, 2025, post on Truth Social, Trump stated he is instructing the Department of War to prepare for possible action, describing any future attack as 'fast, fierce, and sweet'\u2014mirroring the brutality of the attackers. He also called on Congressman Riley Moore of West Virginia to provide a report on the situation, citing estimates that over 50,000 Christians have been killed since 2009, with more than 7,000 deaths in 2025 alone. Moore, who has long highlighted the crisis, described Nigeria as 'the most dangerous country on Earth for a Christian' and identified three main groups responsible: Boko Haram, the Islamic State in West Africa, and the Fulani pastoralist community. Although these groups have different objectives, Moore asserts they are united by a common goal: the genocide of Christians. He criticized the Nigerian government for 'practically closing its eyes' to the violence and emphasized that U.S. security assistance has not been used to combat these terrorist groups. Trump, following Moore\u2019s advocacy, redesignated Nigeria as a 'Country of Particular Concern' under the International Religious Freedom Act, unlocking 15 tools including aid cuts, security assistance suspension, and sanctions. Moore stressed that the goal is not regime change but targeted action to stop the persecution, and he believes this can be achieved without direct military intervention.

He rejected claims made by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who alleged the mass killing of Christians in Nigeria, the continent\u2019s most populous country. Speaking from the United Nations headquarters in New York, Youssouf stated that the situation in northern Nigeria does not compare to the atrocities witnessed in regions such as eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. He emphasized the need for caution before making such statements, noting that the primary victims of Boko Haram\u2019s terrorist activities have been Muslims, not Christians. Youssouf underscored that Boko Haram has committed horrific crimes over the past 15 years, but predominantly targeted Muslim communities. He concluded that labeling the situation as a 'genocide against Christians' lacks factual basis on the ground. This comes after Trump\u2019s statements in early November 2025, in which he claimed he had ordered the U.S. Department of Defense to prepare for a 'rapid military action' if Nigeria did not take 'decisive steps' against the killing of Christians, without providing evidence. Trump also threatened to cut off 'all aid and assistance' to Nigeria and warned of a 'strong intervention' if the alleged 'atrocities against Christians' continued, stating he 'would not tolerate the killing of innocents.' The Nigerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded by affirming the government\u2019s commitment to 'fighting violent extremism in all its forms,' stressing that Nigeria 'will continue to defend all citizens regardless of ethnicity, creed, or religion,' and expressing hope that Washington remains a 'close ally and partner' in combating terrorism. The government confirmed ongoing military operations against Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa, noting 'tangible progress in reclaiming areas previously under terrorist control.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 04:47 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/african-union-trump-statements)\n\n**African Union Chief Denies Genocide in Nigeria Amid Trump's Accusations**\nOn Wednesday, November 13, 2025, African Union Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf stated there is no genocide occurring in northern Nigeria, rejecting claims made by former U.S. President Donald Trump that 'very large numbers' of Christians are being killed in Africa's most populous country. Speaking to journalists at the United Nations headquarters in New York, Youssouf said the situation in northern Nigeria does not resemble the atrocities witnessed in Sudan or eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, and urged 'careful consideration before making such statements.' He emphasized that 'the first victims of Boko Haram are Muslims, not Christians.' Boko Haram has waged an insurgency in northeastern Nigeria for 15 years, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths, with human rights experts confirming that the majority of victims are Muslim. Trump had previously called for the U.S. Department of Defense to prepare for a 'rapid' military response if Nigeria does not take strict action to stop the killings of Christians, without providing specific evidence. He also threatened to cut all aid to Nigeria and possibly carry out a 'complete cleansing' of the country from 'Islamic terrorists.' In response, Nigeria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs affirmed its ongoing fight against extremism, expressed hope for continued strong U.S. partnership, and stressed that it 'will continue to protect all citizens regardless of ethnicity, creed, or religion.' Nigeria is home to over 200 ethnic groups practicing Christianity, Islam, and traditional religions, with a long history of coexistence, despite sporadic violence fueled by ethnic divisions or resource conflicts.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 02:39 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/11/13/%d8%b1%d8%a6%d9%8a%d8%b3-%d9%85%d9%81%d9%88%d8%b6%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%a7%d8%af-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a3%d9%81%d8%b1%d9%8a%d9%82%d9%8a-%d9%84%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d9%88%d8%ac%d8%af)\n\n**There's no genocide in Nigeria, says AU chief after Trump military threats**\nThe African Union Commission chairperson, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, stated on November 12, 2025, at the United Nations in New York, that there is no genocide occurring in northern Nigeria, rejecting claims made by U.S. President Donald Trump that 'very large numbers' of Christians were being killed in the country. Youssouf emphasized that the situation in northern Nigeria differs from atrocities seen in Sudan or eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and urged caution, saying, 'Think twice before... making such statements.' He noted that the first victims of the extremist Islamist group Boko Haram are Muslims, not Christians, citing that human rights experts have confirmed most Boko Haram victims have been Muslim. Trump had earlier in November 2025 demanded the Defense Department prepare for potential 'fast' military action if Nigeria fails to stop the killings of Christians, and threatened to 'stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria' and possibly 'go into that now disgraced country, guns-a-blazing, to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists.' Nigeria's Foreign Ministry responded by affirming its commitment to fighting violent extremism and maintaining its alliance with the United States, stating it 'will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion.'

However, the article argues that the U.S. has no vital national security interest in Nigeria, despite a strong humanitarian concern. The violence is primarily carried out by Boko Haram, the Islamic State in West Africa Province, and Fulani tribal militants, with estimates suggesting over 52,000 Christians killed and more than 10,000 churches burned since 2009, including over 7,000 in the first eight months of 2025. The Nigerian government denies targeting Christians, claiming terrorists attack all who oppose their ideology. An adviser to President Bola Tinubu stated that while U.S. assistance is welcome, it must respect Nigeria\u2019s territorial integrity\u2014something any military incursion would violate. Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa with 237 million people, is divided roughly 50-50 between Christians and Muslims, with 40% under 14 years old and millions of displaced Christians living in camps. The article questions the feasibility of U.S. military action: deploying aircraft carriers near Nigeria would risk civilian casualties due to terrorists hiding in schools and hospitals; ground operations would require massive logistics, intelligence, and time, and could provoke the Nigerian government. Special forces and Marine deployments would face intelligence gaps and long-term commitments, with no guarantee of success. The article concludes that Nigeria would become a quagmire, with terrorists relocating to northern Nigeria or neighboring countries. It criticizes Trump\u2019s pattern of unfulfilled threats\u2014against Putin, the Taliban, and Maduro\u2014arguing that such rhetoric undermines American credibility and risks American lives without strategic justification. The author urges hope that Trump will shift focus and avoid action, emphasizing that the U.S. should not risk lives where there is no vital national security interest.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 05:09 PM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/12/trump-attack-nigeria/)\n\n**Jihad at Lake Chad: Why Trump Threatens Invasion of Nigeria**\nThe situation in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is rapidly deteriorating, marked by escalating conflict between two major jihadist groups: Boko Haram* and Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP)*. The conflict, rooted in ideological differences since 2015, has intensified into a violent struggle for territory, resources, and influence around Lake Chad, which spans Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. Boko Haram*, led by Abubakar Shekau, split from ISWAP* after Shekau rejected the leadership of Abu Musab al-Barnawi in 2016. Boko Haram* adheres to a radical takfiri ideology, targeting Muslims who do not join the jihad, while ISWAP* has sought to gain local support by avoiding attacks on mosques and markets. The conflict entered a new phase in December 2022, with ISWAP* launching attacks that killed around 56 fighters. By 2024, Boko Haram* had driven ISWAP* southward into Nigeria, conducting punitive operations against civilians suspected of sympathizing with rivals. In May, nearly 100 people were killed in Malam Karamti and Kwattatandashi; in late October\u2013early November, Boko Haram* attacked ISWAP* positions on Tumbun-Gini Island, killing 50 and seizing weapons and explosives. The group aims to control rich fishing resources, strategic islands, and trade routes. Christian communities face severe persecution: from January to August 2025, at least 7,087 Christians were killed (32 per day), and 7,899 were abducted. In Benue State, Amnesty International** reported at least 6,896 deaths from January 2024 to May 2025, with over 500,000 internally displaced persons. Notable massacres occurred in Sanke and Eveta, where 72 and 100\u2013280 people were killed, respectively. Since 2009, approximately 125,000 Christians have been killed, 19,000 churches destroyed, and 1,100 Christian communities displaced. A separate conflict between Muslim Fulani herders and Christian farmers in central Nigeria is driven by competition for water and pasture, not religion. In early November 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Nigeria\u2019s leadership of failing to protect Christians, threatening immediate military intervention. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed this, stating: 'Either Nigeria protects Christians, or we destroy the Islamist terrorists responsible.' Trump\u2019s actions are driven by three goals: consolidating support among evangelical Christians (25% of the U.S. electorate), reasserting U.S. influence in Africa (due to Nigeria\u2019s oil, gas, and critical minerals vital for green tech), and diverting attention from domestic crises. The Pentagon has developed three scenarios: a large-scale naval and air campaign, targeted drone strikes using MQ-9 Reapers and MQ-1 Predators, and enhanced intelligence sharing and joint operations. However, high-ranking Pentagon officials admit that limited operations won\u2019t significantly reduce violence or degrade terrorist capabilities, requiring a full-scale campaign like in Iraq or Afghanistan\u2014something the White House currently rejects. Nigeria faces a dire dilemma: unable to counter the jihadists alone, yet facing U.S. political leverage exploiting the crisis.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 03:53 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0421\u041d\u0413 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 - \u0418\u0410 REGNUM](https://regnum.ru/article/4000463)\n\n**Nigerian Christian leader calls Trump's spotlight on violence in Nigeria an 'answered prayer'**\nAndrew Gwaivangmin, executive secretary of the Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association, stated that Christians in Nigeria are 'excited' that former U.S. President Donald Trump has prioritized efforts to stop violence against believers, calling it an 'answered prayer.' In a Fox News interview, Gwaivangmin said the international community had long failed to act, but Trump's focus on the crisis\u2014marked by threats to send U.S. troops 'guns-a-blazing' and cut aid if violence continues\u2014has brought urgent attention. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu responded on X, denying that Nigeria is religiously intolerant and emphasizing the government's commitment to religious freedom and interfaith cooperation. Open Doors, an international Christian organization, reported that attacks on Christians, primarily by Islamist militants like Boko Haram and Fulani fighters, are concentrated in northern Nigeria but increasingly spreading to the Middle Belt and southern regions. Gwaivangmin shared that missionaries have been killed and displaced, with hundreds of widows resulting from these attacks, and expressed hope for U.S. logistical and equipment support, though he dismissed the idea of direct American military presence as unrealistic.

Trump claimed he had instructed the Pentagon to prepare for 'possible action' and vowed to send U.S. troops 'guns a-blazing' to 'completely wipe out the Islamic terrorists' responsible for 'horrible, horrible atrocities.' The statements, which were widely circulated and sparked global concern, were initially questioned for authenticity\u2014some claimed they were AI-generated, though the White House denied this, stating Trump 'just looks that good.' Nigeria\u2019s government strongly rejected the allegations, with Information Minister Mohammed Idris calling them 'false, baseless, despicable, and divisive,' and President Bola Ahmed Tinubu denying religious intolerance. However, the reality of violence in Nigeria is complex: while Christian communities in the northcentral region, such as Yelwata and Zike, suffered mass killings by armed herders (mostly Fulani, Muslim) in June and April 2025, the root causes are not religious but rather competition over shrinking farmland and water resources due to population growth and climate pressures. Analysts, including Malik Samuel of Good Governance Africa and Miriam Adah of ACLED, emphasize that the conflict is primarily a land dispute, not a religious war. ACLED data from 2020 to 2025 shows 317 Christian deaths in 385 targeted attacks, but 417 Muslim deaths in 196 attacks\u2014indicating Muslims are disproportionately affected overall. Additionally, jihadist groups like Boko Haram and ISWAP, which have killed over 40,000 people since 2009, primarily target Muslims deemed 'insufficiently devout,' with the majority of victims in the predominantly Muslim northeast. The conflict has also seen intense infighting between Boko Haram and ISWAP, including a deadly clash in August 2025 on Lake Chad that killed around 200 fighters. Despite Trump\u2019s framing of the crisis as a 'Christian genocide,' experts argue this oversimplification risks exacerbating religious divisions and could trigger a 'religious crisis.' Critics, including Bill Maher and Rep. John James, echoed Trump\u2019s narrative, but analysts like Dr. Uche Igwe of LSE argue the U.S. attention could pressure Nigeria to improve governance and intelligence-sharing, though the danger remains that military threats could worsen instability. The article concludes that while U.S. involvement could aid peace efforts, the focus must shift from blaming religion to addressing systemic governance failures and promoting national unity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 01:52 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15269745/The-slaughter-Christians-Nigeria-sparked-fury-Trump-blown-religious-crisis.html)\n\n**[OPINION] Is Rambo Coming To Dinner? - Wole Olaoye**\nWole Olaoye's opinion piece examines the escalating violence in Nigeria's Middle Belt, framing it as a systematic campaign of religious persecution and territorial conquest targeting Christians. The article highlights the rise of Islamist extremism following the adoption of Sharia Law in 12 northern Nigerian states, the infiltration of Libyan-trained terrorists, and the exploitation of banditry as a 'war economy' involving illicit mining and forced demographic changes. It references claims by activist Mike Arnold and Bishop Wilfred Anagbe that the conflict is not merely 'farmer-herder clashes' but a coordinated effort involving foreign jihadists, criminal mining networks, and political manipulation. The piece responds to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to intervene militarily in Nigeria if the government fails to protect Christians, citing a Truth Social post where Trump vowed to 'go into that now disgraced country, guns-a-blazing' and 'attack fast, vicious, and sweet.' The author warns that a Rambo-style U.S. military intervention risks worsening the situation, advocating instead for a 'light, partner-enabled' approach through intelligence and logistics cooperation with Nigeria. The article concludes with a quote from Teacher Abel: 'O deity, save me if you can; if not, just leave me as you met me,' underscoring the desperation of Nigeria\u2019s crisis. The author criticizes Nigerian governments for complicity, impunity, and failure to prosecute terrorists, while urging the U.S. to target the root causes, not specific ethnic groups.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 06:42 AM\nSource:[reubenabati.com.ng](https://reubenabati.com.ng/opinion/opinion-is-rambo-coming-to-dinner-wole-olaoye)\n\n**[OPINION] Before Trump Drops His Bombs - Simon Kolawole**\nSimon Kolawole's opinion piece critiques former U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to cut all aid to Nigeria and potentially launch a military strike if the government continues to allow the killing of Christians. Trump, in a post on Truth Social, demanded that Nigeria act swiftly against 'Islamic Terrorists' responsible for 'horrible atrocities' and instructed the U.S. Department of War to prepare for possible action, using aggressive language such as 'guns-a-blazing,' 'fast, vicious, and sweet.' However, Kolawole notes that Trump did not mention 'Christian genocide'\u2014a term popularized by the NGO InterSociety, linked to the separatist IPOB\u2014despite its widespread use in American lobbying circles. The author argues that the Nigerian security crisis is multidimensional: (1) terrorism (Boko Haram), (2) insurgency, (3) banditry and kidnapping, (4) herders-farmers clashes, and (5) communal conflicts. He emphasizes that Trump\u2019s focus on 'Islamic Terrorists' misrepresents the complex reality\u2014especially in the Middle Belt, where conflicts are primarily over land and grazing rights, not religion. Kolawole warns that military intervention would not resolve these deep-rooted issues, citing the U.S. failure in Afghanistan as evidence that terrorism cannot be 'completely wiped out' with speed and force. He also questions the feasibility of 'Operation exNigeria' (a hypothetical breakup of Nigeria), noting that Christians are spread across northern states, not just the southeast. Additionally, the piece highlights China\u2019s cautious stance on Nigeria, rejecting foreign interference, while also addressing unrelated topics: celebrating two journalists\u2019 60th birthdays, criticizing FIFA\u2019s appointment of South African referees for a Nigeria-Gabon match, and questioning a proposed ban on petrol vehicles in favor of electric ones\u2014pointing out the irony of needing petrol generators to charge EVs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 06:07 AM\nSource:[reubenabati.com.ng](https://reubenabati.com.ng/opinion/opinion-before-trump-drops-his-bombs-simon-kolawole)\n\n**Explained: Trump's 'Guns\u2011a\u2011Blazing' Warning to Nigeria, Religious Violence, Political Implications**\nUS President Donald Trump threatened military action in Nigeria, warning he could go 'guns-a-blazing' to stop Islamic extremists accused of targeting Christians, following a Truth Social post on November 2, 2025. He stated that the U.S. would halt all aid if Nigeria failed to protect Christians and instructed the Department of War to prepare for potential strikes, promising they would be 'fast, vicious, and sweet.' US Secretary of War Pete Hegseth echoed the warning on X, asserting the U.S. would act against 'Islamic Terrorists' committing atrocities. Nigeria responded by welcoming American assistance but insisting on respect for its sovereignty, with adviser Daniel Bwala stating, 'We welcome US assistance as long as it recognises our territorial integrity.' This follows Trump\u2019s designation of Nigeria as a 'Country of Particular Concern' under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998\u2014a label that enables sanctions or aid restrictions. The designation, previously applied during Trump\u2019s first term and lifted by Biden, currently includes China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Saudi Arabia. US aid to Nigeria remains substantial: $32.5 million approved in September 2025 for hunger relief and $27 million part of a $536 million humanitarian package for Sub-Saharan Africa in August 2024. The conflict in Nigeria involves Boko Haram and the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWA), responsible for 20,409 deaths across 11,862 attacks on civilians from January 2020 to September 2023, including 385 attacks targeting Christians (317 deaths) and 196 attacks on Muslims (417 deaths). The violence stems from religious extremism, ethnic and herder-farmer clashes, economic inequality, and colonial-era legacies. Boko Haram, founded in 2002, seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate and opposes Western education, gaining global attention after the 2014 Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping, with over 50 girls still missing. Despite Trump\u2019s rhetoric, actual U.S. military action is constrained by limited presence\u2014US forces no longer operate in Niger, a key base for monitoring Sahel extremism, following its closure in 2024 after the Niger government rejected American presence. Analysts note Trump\u2019s stance aligns with his political focus on white Christian voters, a key demographic, echoing past rhetoric about 'genocide against White people' in South Africa.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd](https://newsable.asianetnews.com/world/trumps-guns-blazing-warning-to-nigeria-religious-violence-political-implications-articleshow-m5fd73i)\n\n**Trump Threatens Military Action Against Nigeria Over Alleged Christian Killings**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Saturday, November 2, 2025, to send 'heavily armed' American forces to Nigeria if the country does not stop what he described as the killing of Christians by Islamists.

Trump also stated that the U.S. would immediately halt all aid to Nigeria if the government fails to act. In response, Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu expressed willingness to meet with Trump in the coming days. The Nigerian presidential spokesperson, Daniel Baowa, stated that Trump had previously helped Nigeria by allowing arms sales, which aided anti-terrorism efforts and led to 'good results.' Baowa emphasized that attacks in Nigeria target not only Christians but also adherents of other faiths and non-believers, and that this issue would be discussed during a potential meeting. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth confirmed that the Pentagon is preparing for possible action, stating that either Nigeria protects Christians or the U.S. will eliminate the Islamist extremists committing atrocities. Trump, who has previously sought the Nobel Peace Prize without success, posted on Truth Social that 'thousands of Christians are being killed' and blamed extremist Muslims, though he provided no evidence. The claim that Nigeria is 'non-tolerant' religiously was rejected by President Tinubu, who stated that religious freedom and tolerance are foundational to Nigeria's national identity. Nigeria is roughly split between a Muslim-majority north and a Christian-majority south. Violent conflicts have persisted for over 15 years in northeastern Nigeria due to Boko Haram, which has caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced two million since 2009, according to the UN.

In March 2025, Congressman Chris Smith urged the U.S. State Department to designate Nigeria as a 'country of particular concern' due to religious freedom violations. Trump also labeled Nigeria a 'country of particular concern' on Friday, November 1, 2025. The U.S. State Department designates such countries for severe religious freedom abuses.

The northeast has seen over 15 years of jihadist violence by the extremist group Boko Haram, which has caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced 2 million since 2009, according to the UN. In the northwest, 'bandit' gangs attack villages, killing and kidnapping civilians. Central Nigeria remains a hotspot for recurring clashes between Muslim herders and Christian farmers, which experts say are primarily over land due to population growth, despite having a religiously charged appearance.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 08:27 AM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/ar/%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7/20251102-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D8%B6%D8%AF-%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D9%80%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%A8%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86)\n\n**Donald Trump Threatens Military Intervention Against Nigeria Over Alleged Christian Killings**\nOn November 1, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Nigeria with military intervention on Truth Social if the country did not stop the 'murders of Christians' committed by 'Islamic terrorists' on its soil. Trump stated that if the Nigerian government continues to tolerate such killings, the United States would immediately cease all aid and could 'go into this now dishonored country and shoot wildly' to completely destroy the terrorists responsible for 'horrible atrocities.' He ordered the Department of Defense to prepare for possible action and urged Nigeria to act quickly. This follows Trump's designation of Nigeria as a 'Country of Particular Concern' (CPC) for religious freedom earlier in the week, claiming Christianity faces an 'existential threat' in the country. The Nigerian government rejected the accusations, with President Bola Tinubu stating on X that labeling Nigeria as religiously intolerant 'does not reflect our national reality.' Nigeria faces ongoing security challenges, including the jihadist insurgency by Boko Haram and its offshoot ISWAP in the northeast\u2014responsible for over 40,000 deaths and the displacement of more than 2 million people since 2009\u2014and recurring violent clashes in the central region between Muslim Fulani herders and Christian farmers, which are often framed as religious conflicts but are primarily rooted in land disputes. Trump cited unverified figures claiming 3,100 Christians were killed in Nigeria compared to 4,476 globally, though these statistics lack clear sourcing.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 07:25 AM\nSource:[CNEWS](https://www.cnews.fr/monde/2025-11-02/nigeria-donald-trump-menace-dune-intervention-militaire-si-le-pays-ne-met-pas-fin)\n\n**Trump Accuses Nigeria of Religious Persecution, Threatens Military Action Amid Security Crisis**\nDonald Trump has accused the Nigerian government of tolerating the killings of Christians, labeling the situation a 'existential threat' to Christianity in the country. On Truth Social, Trump threatened to cut all U.S. aid to Nigeria and warned of potential military action, stating, 'If the Nigerian government continues to tolerate the murders of Christians, the United States will immediately cease all aid and could very well go into this now dishonored country and shoot wildly to completely destroy the Islamist terrorists committing these horrible atrocities.' He ordered the Department of War to prepare for action. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth echoed this on X, asserting the Pentagon is 'preparing to act': 'Either the Nigerian government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamist terrorists committing these horrible atrocities.' Trump had previously placed Nigeria on the U.S. 'Country of Particular Concern' (CPC) list for religious freedom in October 2025, citing 'a threat to Christianity' despite providing no source for his claim of 3,100 Christian deaths in Nigeria versus 4,476 globally. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu rejected the characterization, stating on X that 'the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect our national reality.' The country faces multiple security challenges: Boko Haram and its offshoot ISWAP remain active in the northeast, having caused over 40,000 deaths and displaced over 2 million since 2009, according to UN estimates. In central Nigeria, violent clashes between Muslim Peul herders and Christian farmers\u2014often framed as religious conflicts\u2014are rooted in land disputes. In the northwest, criminal gangs known as 'bandits' terrorize communities through kidnappings, killings, and arson. Trump's advisor for Africa, Massad Boulos, claimed in October that jihadists kill 'more Muslims than Christians' in Nigeria. This stance aligns with Trump\u2019s prior rhetoric on Afrikaners in South Africa, whom he claimed were victims of a 'genocide' and granted refugee status, despite their historical role in apartheid. The article notes that the U.S. and European far-right political figures have amplified these claims, though experts question their validity.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 06:03 AM\nSource:[La-R%C3%A9publique-des-Pyr%C3%A9n%C3%A9es](https://www.larepubliquedespyrenees.fr/societe/afp/france-monde-societe/trump-accuse-le-nigeria-de-tolerer-les-meurtres-de-chretiens-et-menace-le-pays-d-une-action-militaire-26566741.php)\n\n**Trump threatens to send US military into Nigeria with 'guns-a-blazing'**\nDonald Trump has threatened to send the U.S. military into Nigeria 'guns-a-blazing' if the Nigerian government fails to stop what he describes as the killing of Christians by Islamists. On Truth Social, Trump claimed he instructed the Department of War to prepare for possible military action, stating that the U.S. would stop all aid and intervene to 'completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists' responsible for 'horrible atrocities.' He added, 'I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians.' Pete Hegseth, the U.S. Defense Secretary, endorsed the post, saying, 'Yes sir. The Department of War is preparing for action. Either the Nigerian Government protects Christians, or we will kill the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities.' Trump made these claims without providing evidence, echoing assertions from conservative U.S. politicians such as Congressman Chris Smith, Senator Ted Cruz, and Congressman Riley Moore, who have accused Nigeria of failing to protect Christians. The U.S. State Department, under Trump\u2019s announcement, designated Nigeria a 'Country of Particular Concern' (CPC) in March 2025 over an 'existential threat' to Christians. Nigeria\u2019s President Bola Ahmed Tinubu rejected the characterization, stating, 'The characterisation of Nigeria as religiously intolerant does not reflect our national reality. Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so.' Nigeria, Africa\u2019s most populous country, is divided between a Muslim-majority north and a Christian-majority south. The country faces severe security challenges: Boko Haram has killed over 40,000 people and displaced over 2 million since 2009, and in central Nigeria, conflicts between Muslim herders and Christian farmers\u2014often framed as religious but rooted in land access disputes\u2014have led to deadly violence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 04:58 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/trump-threatens-send-us-military-045826014.html)\n\n**Trump Threatens 'Fast, Vicious' Military Action Against Nigeria Over Christian Killings, Halts All US Aid**\nOn November 2, 2025, former U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social that he would halt all U.S. aid to Nigeria and direct the Department of Defense to prepare for 'fast, vicious' military action against the country, citing the killing of Christians. Trump claimed that U.S. forces would go in 'guns-a-blazing' to 'completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists' responsible for 'horrible atrocities,' describing Nigeria as a 'disgraced country' that must act swiftly. This threat followed the reinstatement of Nigeria on the U.S. State Department's 'Countries of Particular Concern' list, which designates nations that have engaged in or tolerated severe religious freedom violations\u2014Nigeria had been removed under President Joe Biden in 2021. Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu rejected the characterization of Nigeria as religiously intolerant, stating that the government has consistently safeguarded religious freedom and that the country mourns victims of violent extremism. Human rights experts note that Boko Haram, an Islamist extremist group, has killed tens of thousands in northeast Nigeria over 15 years, with Muslims constituting the majority of victims. The U.S. military presence in West Africa has declined significantly, with about 1,000 troops withdrawn from Niger in 2024. Other nations on the 'Countries of Particular Concern' list include China, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, and Pakistan.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 03:01 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/politics/25/11/48580022/trump-threatens-fast-vicious-military-action-against-nigeria-over-christian-killings-halts-all-us-aid)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert domains\u2014including military strategy, diplomacy, intelligence, international relations, security studies, and African studies\u2014there is a strong consensus that the probability of the United States conducting a military attack within Nigeria before January 1, 2026, is very low, despite unusually escalatory rhetoric from President Trump and explicit reports of the Pentagon being ordered to prepare for possible action. Experts cite numerous factors driving down the likelihood: the historical absence of direct US military strikes in Nigeria or comparable large African states; strong regional and international (African Union, Nigerian government, UN) opposition to unilateral intervention; absence of vital US strategic interests; major operational and logistical hurdles following a US withdrawal from regional bases (notably Niger); and the prevalence of past US threats that were not matched by kinetic action. While some raise the probability marginally to account for the unprecedented level of presidential posturing and allow for a possible last-minute limited drone strike or similar action in the event of a dramatic and widely publicized mass atrocity, all agree that\u2014barring such an unexpected catalyzing event\u2014the prevailing incentives, constraints, and base rates overwhelmingly imply a 'No' outcome. Numerical probability forecasts cluster between 3% and 8%, with most experts favoring the lower end. The most cited path to a Yes involves a sensational, viral mass killing of Christians and subsequent overwhelming domestic political pressure, but even then, experts express skepticism given the structural, legal, and reputational costs. Overall, a US military attack within Nigeria before the deadline is seen as highly improbable.",
