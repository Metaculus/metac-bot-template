No current bill is on the legislative docket, and President Zelensky\u2019s public statements continue to caution against lowering the age without solving equipment/training deficits. Social and political pushback remains a formidable obstacle, and alternative pathways (broader incentive contracts, new roles for women) offer partial relief. Although an acute crisis could change the calculus, nothing in current reporting suggests it is inevitable in the next 13 months. Historically, force structure changes of this magnitude under democracy and war have usually followed catastrophic events or clear-cut consensus\u2014which are not yet present.

There is *no* bill currently in play to lower the minimum age, and the limited legislative session left before the end of 2025 makes passage of such a controversial, unpopular measure unlikely except in true national emergency. Comparative international base rates reinforce the rarity: even in existential wars, conscription of under-21s en masse is typically last-resort, and only after all incremental steps (of which several remain) are exhausted.

Factoring in the strong negative weight of public resistance, elite reluctance, and the presence of policy-offramp alternatives (contract incentives, deferrals), combined with no apparent legislative momentum and explicit leadership statements opposing such action, the balance of probability is that Ukraine will NOT lower the mandatory conscription age below 25 before 2026.

Furthermore, the historical base rate of such measures in post-Soviet and European wartime societies is low in the absence of state collapse or existential military setbacks. However, the risk cannot be considered minuscule: Western lobbying and military necessity are real, and the extraordinary volatility of the battleground means that a \"last-ditch\" move cannot be completely ruled out.

It isn\u2019t enough for there to be external pressure or even manpower crisis\u2014the political system won\u2019t gamble legitimacy and risk youth exodus without exhausting contract offers, procedural tweaks and targeted mobilization. Your low but not negligible probability is the right calibration: it reflects the faint possibility of a late-December shock, but is firmly anchored by how these systems really function under stress. Other approaches\u2014like neorealism or wishful doctrines of crisis-fueled sweep\u2014overplay the hand. Your process lens earns its keep here."

The base rate for two age reductions in such quick succession is nearly vanishing\u2014especially without clear legislative beginnings or public consensus-building already underway.

My own initial forecast (22%) was higher than the median, justified by force structure logic and the real, albeit low, likelihood of an exigent shock precipitating a change. After deliberation, I recognize that my estimate may slightly overstate the political elasticity and under-account for the remaining procedural and legitimacy friction, especially in the absence of precipitating events as of early November. The range of 10-15% from other knowledgeable forecasters seems more appropriate in the short window left, but I do not find the lowest (<5%) estimates adequately reflect Ukraine\u2019s proven capacity for policy lurch under stress.

However, no current signals indicate imminent battlefield collapse or Western ultimatums severe enough to force this issue in the next seven weeks.

While one forecaster slightly increases fat-tail risk due to potential for abrupt crisis-driven action, there is little concrete basis for shifting my probability upward.

However, several peers persuasively stressed that in wartime, crises can catalyze sudden policy shifts, and the procedural/legislative timeline is not truly fixed if a catastrophic event occurs. Thus, the 'fat tail' (i.e., the possibility of a shock) deserves modestly more weight than my initial ultra-low probability allowed. While I continue to see all status quo indicators aligned against such a reform, and still see no legislative motion or precipitating event, I recognize that an extremely acute battlefield or political shock\u2014especially under combined Western pressure and existential risk\u2014could push leaders to leapfrog normal process.

The distribution of forecasts clustered in the low single digits, reinforcing both the historical rarity and severe institutional brakes on such a move. I see no evidence to substantially increase my probability, but I am moved to trim it by a point, given the additional weight of the legislative process and social risk arguments above.

Although my critique of ultra-low estimates stands (wartime crisis can dissolve process inertia fast), the cross-disciplinary consensus paints even a crisis-induced turnaround as less likely in the very limited time remaining before 2026. Rational choice may underplay shock scenarios, but policy process and institutional perspectives convincingly argue that even catastrophic events would not guarantee a change of this magnitude and speed. The tail risk for a sudden 'Yes' is real, but perhaps not as fat as I initially assessed.

The draft aims to provide a 12-month deferment from military conscription for certain categories of citizens, specifically military conscripts and reservists aged 18 to 25 who served a one-year contract during the state of war and were subsequently discharged. Under the proposed law, these individuals may only be conscripted during mobilization with their explicit consent during the 12-month deferment period. The need for this legal amendment arises from a gap in current legislation: after completing their one-year contract, these young citizens lose their deferment rights until they reach 25, leaving them vulnerable to immediate mobilization upon re-registration. The law seeks to resolve this legal contradiction and allow former contract soldiers time to reintegrate. The Verkhovna Rada also passed draft Law No. 12094 to improve mobile connectivity and ensure fast, stable internet nationwide. Additionally, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed laws extending the state of war and general mobilization for 90 days, effective until at least February 3, 2026. An update to the 'Rezerv+' app now allows single parents raising a child to obtain an online deferment if the other parent has died or lost parental rights.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/country/society/rada-pidtrimala-zakonoprojekt-shchodo-novoji-vidstrochki-shcho-vidomo-1086662.html)\n\n**Zelenskyy Signs Law on Temporary Reserve for OPK Workers Facing Conscription Issues**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a law enabling the temporary reserve status of employees from the Military-Industrial Complex (OPK) who face issues with military conscription.

The law expands employers' ability to conscript workers during wartime, permitting conscription regardless of whether employees have no military ID, incomplete personal data, are wanted by authorities, or have improperly issued military documents. The conscription period is up to 45 calendar days from the date of the employment contract and can occur no more than once per year. The law does not exempt employees from responsibility for registration violations; employers may terminate employees who fail to correct these issues within the set timeframe. Additionally, the law introduces a probationary period of up to 45 days for new employees in the defense-industrial complex. The measure aims to stabilize defense production and maintain workforce continuity amid ongoing war. The law applies to all military-duty personnel working in critical institutions, regardless of prior conscription status.

The Verkhovna Rada passed draft law \u211613574, granting a 12-month deferment from mobilization to military personnel aged 18\u201325 who served under a one-year contract during martial law, aiming to protect youth and prevent immediate re-mobilization. The law, if adopted, will amend Article 23 of the Law on Mobilization Preparation and Mobilization, with implementation expected after official publication. The process now requires applicants to submit documents via Centralized National Application Points (\u0426\u041d\u0410\u041f\u044b), not directly to Territorial Centers of Conscription and Social Support (\u0422\u0426\u041a). Documents are scanned and sent electronically to \u0422\u0426\u041a and the Service of Decision-Making (\u0421\u041f), with decisions communicated through the 'Reserv+' app. Deferments are automatically renewed for those with valid data in the registry and the 'Reserv+' app, provided the original deferment was granted before November 5, 2025. However, according to lawyer Darya Tarasenko, the Ministry of Defense\u2019s interpretation\u2014requiring confirmed data in the registry\u2014contradicts the government\u2019s official decree, which states that most deferments (except for reserved and officials) are automatically renewed based on previously submitted documents. If data are outdated or missing, individuals must reapply via \u0426\u041d\u0410\u041f. The list of 10 online deferment types available in 'Reserv+' remains unchanged, including disability, fatherhood of a child with a disability, large family status, and student/graduate status. Paper certificates have been abolished, with the electronic military record in 'Reserv+' serving as the sole proof. The Ministry of Defense advises that if automatic renewal fails, it indicates outdated or missing data, requiring updates or reapplication. Experts emphasize that 'automatic renewal' applies only to existing deferments, not new applications, and recommend checking deferment status on November 5 to avoid issues.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 04:19 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/ukrayina/otsrochka-ot-mobilizatsii-v-noyabre-novye-pravila-avtomaticheskoe-prodlenie-i-klyuchevye-izmeneniya-2949701.html)\n\n**Zelensky's Military Contract Initiative: New Incentives for Armed Forces \u2013 What\u2019s Real and What\u2019s Missing?**\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky and Minister of Defense Denys Shmyhal announced on October 3, 2024, a new initiative to introduce military contracts ranging from one to five years, aimed at improving retention and motivation among Ukrainian servicemen. These contracts will include increased monthly payments, signing bonuses, and an expanded social package. Soldiers signing contracts for two to five years will receive a one-year deferment from mobilization after their service ends. The initiative is open not only to new recruits but also to those already serving under mobilization, who may also qualify for a one-time allowance. According to Ivan Kru\u043b\u044cko, First Deputy Head of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Budget, the draft law has not yet been submitted to parliament, and no specific amounts have been confirmed. While social media circulated figures suggesting one-time payments of 530,000 UAH for a one-year contract up to 3.65 million UAH for a five-year contract, Kru\u043b\u044cko described these as 'general ideas' subject to change. He emphasized that no funds for this initiative are currently allocated in the next year\u2019s state budget and stressed the need to secure financial resources, including from frozen Russian assets, through European partners. Kru\u043b\u044cko argued that financial incentives are more effective than forced conscription and are essential to strengthen support for military personnel.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/politics/viplati-viyskovim-i-novi-kontrakti-deputat-nazvav-sumi-shcho-zminyat-i-na-yakiy-stadiji-iniciativa-50558004.html)\n\n**Verkhovna Rada Supports Draft Law on New Deferment: What Is Known**\nThe Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine supported draft Law No. 13574 'On amending Article 23 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Mobilization Preparation and Mobilization' in its first reading.

The state of war has been in effect since February 24, 2022, and the universal mobilization was introduced shortly after. The extension was confirmed by Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada via its Telegram channel and supported by Deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak. The mobilization law has been tightened since last May, with exemptions removed and the conscription age range expanded to include men from 25 to 60 years old. Due to ongoing personnel shortages in the Armed Forces, discussions are intensifying about potentially conscripting women, particularly those with medical and pharmaceutical training, who could serve in non-combat roles to free up men for frontline combat. As of October 1, 2024, Ukrainian women with medical and pharmaceutical education are required to register for military service. Some lawmakers have proposed extending conscription to all women regardless of profession.

Currently, Russian men aged 18\u201330 are required to serve one year of military service, though many avoid it through deferments for students, health conditions, or other reasons. The military has called up between 130,000 and 160,000 draftees per conscription cycle. Authorities claim draftees are not deployed to Ukraine, relying instead on volunteers and mobilized reservists, though human rights groups and media reports suggest draftees are often pressured or coerced into signing volunteer contracts. Russia\u2019s military strength has grown from 1 million in 2022 to 1.5 million active troops, with over 700,000 reportedly fighting in Ukraine. To combat draft evasion, authorities launched an electronic conscription register and imposed penalties such as bank transaction bans, driver\u2019s license suspensions, and travel restrictions. After the unpopular partial mobilization of 300,000 reservists in 2022, which triggered mass emigration, the Kremlin shifted focus to attracting volunteers\u2014440,000 joined in 2024 and 336,000 signed contracts in 2025. A separate bill passed Tuesday mandates that only voluntary active reservists can be assigned to protect 'critically important facilities' from Ukrainian drones that have penetrated over 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) into Russian territory. The Kremlin continues to reject U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for a ceasefire and maintains its maximalist demands, including Ukraine\u2019s withdrawal from four annexed regions, which Kyiv and its Western allies have rejected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 06:23 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/russia-military-conscription-draft-ukraine-war-9849511e45f7b7db596103fd71e69bae)\n\n**Ukraine Considers Lowering Mobilization Age to 23 Amid Infantry Shortage**\nUkraine continues to operate under a state of war and general mobilization, with conscription currently applying to men aged 25 to 60 who are medically fit and without deferments or exemptions. However, officials and military leaders indicate that the mobilization age may be reduced to 23 in 2026 due to a critical shortage of infantry on the front lines. Captain 'Kham' of the 29th Separate Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade stated that reducing the mobilization age to 23 is 'almost inevitable' due to insufficient personnel, emphasizing that 'without infantry, it's impossible to hold the front line.' Legal expert Marina Bekalo confirmed that lowering the mobilization age to 23 is legally feasible by amending Article 37 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Military Duty and Military Service' to include men at age 23 in the conscription register. The process would require a bill to pass through all stages in the Verkhovna Rada, presidential signature, and official publication. As of October 15, 2025, no such bill has been registered. The Office of the President, represented by Deputy Head Pavel Palisa, stated that reducing the mobilization age is not under consideration before September 2025, citing concerns over public reaction and the need to prevent families from sending minors abroad to avoid conscription. Former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba believes any reduction would likely be gradual\u2014by 1\u20132 years\u2014rather than immediate to 18, and warned that such a move would be deeply unpopular across Ukrainian society. International partners, including the U.S., have urged Ukraine to expand mobilization to men aged 18\u201325, referencing the Vietnam War, and have offered full equipment support if such a move is made. However, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the idea of lowering the age to 18, stressing that untrained or poorly equipped young soldiers are not a solution; instead, he emphasized the need to properly equip existing units. Despite ongoing discussions and international pressure, no legislative proposals to reduce the mobilization age have been formally introduced as of October 15, 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 03:43 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/exclusive/mobilizatsiya-po-novomu-v-ukraine-hotyat-snizit-prizyvnoy-vozrast-do-23-let-vse-chto-izvestno-2934575.html)\n\n**Ukraine Considers Lowering Mobilization Age to 23 Amid Infantry Shortage**\nUkraine is currently under a state of war and general mobilization, with military conscription applying to men aged 25 to 60 who are fit for service and without deferments. However, there are growing discussions about reducing the mobilization age to 23, driven by a shortage of infantry on the front lines. According to '\u0425\u0410\u041c', a commander of the 29th separate anti-aircraft missile brigade, lowering the mobilization age to 23 is nearly inevitable due to the lack of personnel and the need to maintain the front line. Legal changes to implement this would require amending Article 37 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Military Duty and Military Service' to include 23-year-old men in the conscription register. This process would involve drafting a bill, passing it through all stages in the Verkhovna Rada, presidential approval, and official publication. As of October 15, 2025, no such bills have been registered. Legal expert Marina Bekalo notes that while reducing the mobilization age to 23 is realistic, further reduction to 18 is theoretically possible but unlikely to be widely accepted by Ukrainian society. Senior officials, including Deputy Head of the Office of the President Pavlo Palisa, state that as of September 2025, the issue is not under active consideration. Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy has reiterated that Ukraine will not reduce the mobilization age to 18, emphasizing the need to first ensure proper equipment for existing units. International partners, particularly the U.S., have urged Ukraine to expand mobilization to include men aged 18\u201325, citing historical examples like the Vietnam War. The U.S. has offered full equipment support if such a move is made, but Zelenskyy argues that the priority should be equipping existing units rather than relying on younger recruits. The idea of lowering the mobilization age has been discussed for over a year, with the most recent legislative change being the reduction of the conscription age from 27 to 25, signed by Zelenskyy on April 2, 2024.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/exclusive/mobilizatsiia-po-novomu-v-ukrayini-khochut-znyzyty-pryzovnyy-vik-do-23-rokiv-use-shcho-vidomo-2934575.html)\n\n**Ukraine May Lower Mobilization Age to 18, According to '\u0421\u0422\u0420\u0410\u041d\u0410.ua'**\nThe Ukrainian online newspaper '\u0421\u0422\u0420\u0410\u041d\u0410.ua', citing sources among members of the Verkhovna Rada, reports that if the front\u2011line situation worsens, the Ukrainian government may consider tightening mobilization measures.

According to Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, special conditions will be provided for this direction. The program, which was previously announced by Zelensky, offers young people aged 18-25 a special contract, including a $24,000 salary, free admission to higher education institutions, and a zero-interest mortgage. However, with the current number of volunteers and mobilized personnel being insufficient to meet the army's needs, some officials have suggested that Ukraine may need to resort to compulsory mobilization of 18-year-olds. In the spring of 2024, Zelensky signed a law reducing the mobilization age from 27 to 25 years. Former US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan later suggested that Ukrainian authorities should consider further reducing the mobilization age to 18 years. 'The government will have to consider the possibility of further reducing the mobilization age to 18 years,' Sullivan said.

    "summary": "Across a wide spectrum of expertise\u2014military policy, Ukrainian legal studies, political science, international relations, and East European studies\u2014forecasters overwhelmingly assess the probability that Ukraine will reduce the minimum age for compulsory military service below 25 before January 1, 2026 as low (ranging from 2% to 22%, with most clustered at or below 15%). Experts consistently highlight several convergent reasons for this assessment:\n\n1. Status Quo & Recent Legislative Pathways: The minimum conscription age stands at 25 following reforms in April 2024. There are no active bills, advanced legislative processes, or clear government initiatives to lower the age further as of November 2025. Recent parliamentary focus is on streamlined mobilization, contract-based service, deferments, and sector-specific exemptions\u2014not on further age reduction.\n\n2. Social & Political Constraints: Reducing the draft age to 18\u201324 is deeply unpopular in Ukrainian society and among elites, with fears of public backlash, legitimacy crisis, mass evasion, and unrest. President Zelensky and top officials have publicly resisted Western calls to lower the age further, emphasizing equipment/force quality over mere numbers and citing social risks.\n\n3. International Pressure: U.S. and other Western partners are pressuring Ukraine to lower the age, sometimes tying such moves to enhanced aid or equipment, but Ukrainian leadership asserts national sovereignty and has not acquiesced. International incentives are noted as a moderate upward factor, but not decisive.\n\n4. Manpower & Military Crisis: Personnel shortages are acknowledged, and some experts caution that a dramatic battlefield collapse or acute crisis could force rapid, unpopular legislative change. However, there is no immediate evidence of such a crisis as of November 2025. Most consider this scenario possible but unlikely within the next two months.\n\n5. Administrative & Temporal Hurdles: The legislative process for such a controversial change is slow, involving committee reviews, multiple readings, and presidential assent. With less than two months before the resolution deadline, passage, publication, and implementation is deemed highly improbable.\n\n6. Base Rate/Historical Precedent: Ukrainian and broader post-Soviet legislative precedent is for incremental, not drastic, changes\u2014even under existential threat. The recent reduction from 27 to 25 took years of debate and socialization.\n\n7. Alternative Measures: Ukraine is expanding contract service and voluntary incentives, targeting specific sectors (including women in non-combat roles), and tightening enforcement over existing eligible cohorts, indicating a preference for these options over broadening compulsory service downward in age.\n\nIn summary, virtually all experts see a low but nonzero probability for a Yes outcome, contingent on an unforeseen sharp deterioration in the military situation or extraordinary external conditionality. However, lacking public evidence of an imminent crisis or legislative initiative, the base rate and present political-legal environment strongly favor a No resolution before January 1, 2026.",
