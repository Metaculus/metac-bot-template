No credible evidence, official leaks, or signaling indicate impending breakout; the time window is very short; and all observable bureaucratic and alliance incentives militate strongly against nuclearization, even as rhetorical frustration lingers.

The original question opened on 2023-09-02 22:08:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17791). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nUkraine seeks tangible security guaranties to protect herself from Russia:\n\n- In 1994, Britain, the US, Ukraine, and Russia signed the [Budapest Memorandum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum), which guaranteed the security and territorial integrity of Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine surrendering her nuclear weapons.\n\n- The Memorandum [failed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_occupation_of_Crimea) to prevent the occupation of several Ukrainian territories by Russia in 2014. \n\n- [Since 2014](https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-parliament-coalition-agreement/26703123.html), Ukraine has been actively seeking to become a NATO member, in hope that it will prevent further military aggression by Russia. \n\n- In 2022, Russia started a large-scale military [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) of Ukraine. During the invasion, Russia has perpetrated a multitude of [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crimes_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine), forcing the International Criminal Court to issue an [arrest warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court_arrest_warrants_for_Vladimir_Putin_and_Maria_Lvova-Belova) for Vladimir Putin. [According](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegations_of_genocide_of_Ukrainians_in_the_Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine) to legal scholars and official statements by several countries, Russia is perpetrating a genocide of Ukrainians as an ethnicity.\n\n- Russian officials have several times threatened Ukraine with a nuclear strike (e.g. by Dmitrii [Medvedev](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-medvedev-warns-west-that-nuclear-threat-is-not-bluff-2022-09-27/)).\n\nUkrainian officials openly stated that a restoration of the Ukrainian nuclear program is the alternative to NATO membership:\n\n- In 2021, Ukrainian Ambassador to Germany Melnyk [said](https://www.dailysabah.com/world/europe/ukraine-mulls-nuclear-arms-if-nato-membership-not-impending-envoy) that if Ukraine is not allowed to become a NATO member, Ukraine might have to reconsider its status as a non-nuclear weapon state to guarantee her security\n- in 2022, President Zelenskyy [said](https://uawire.org/zelensky-ukraine-may-reconsider-its-nuclear-status) that without the promised security guarantees according to the Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine may reconsider its nuclear status.\n\nUkraine has at least some prerequisites for developing nuclear weapons:\n\n- a developed nuclear energy industry (Ukraine is the [#7](https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/CountryStatistics/CountryStatisticsLandingPage.aspx) in the world by nuclear energy generation) \n- uranium ore deposits and processing [facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Ukraine#Uranium_mining)\n- independent manufacturing of delivery systems, including intercontinental ballistic [missiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsyklon).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":17791,\"question_id\":17791}}`",

This program may involve multiple facets including but not limited to uranium enrichment or plutonium reprocessing, warhead design, missile delivery systems, testing procedures, as well as logistical and operational planning for the use of nuclear weapons. For the purposes of this question, we will also consider a weapons program to be a program to deploy nuclear weapons obtained from other countries, as long as those weapons are under Ukraine's ability to command and launch.",

Lavrov emphasized that resolving the Ukraine conflict requires consideration of Russian interests and elimination of root causes, reaffirming Russia's longstanding position. This statement comes amid rumors that Lavrov has lost Vladimir Putin's favor, following his absence from a Russian Security Council meeting on November 5, which coincided with the postponement of a potential Putin-Trump summit in Budapest. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed these reports as 'completely unrelated to reality,' confirming Lavrov's continued role as foreign minister. Lavrov also noted that the U.S. has not yet provided a substantive response to Russia's proposal to extend the New START treaty for one year, though he stated that Russia has conveyed its proposals on diplomatic asset return and resumption of air traffic and is awaiting a response. He added that practical contacts on dialogue sustainability are ongoing. Regarding the Ukraine conflict, Lavrov declined to confirm whether the U.S. has expressed willingness to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, stating that details of U.S.-Russia discussions are not publicly disclosed. The issue of territorial sovereignty remains a core point of contention, as Russia has controlled Crimea since 2014 and approximately one-fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory since its 2022 'special military operation.' Lavrov further stated that Russia is implementing Putin\u2019s directive from the November 5 Security Council meeting to prepare for nuclear testing in response to U.S. nuclear testing announcements, despite his absence from the meeting, signaling continued involvement in the matter.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 11:40 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251109051700080)\n\n**Lavrov Claims U.S. Gave Secret Promise to Russia on Ukraine, Reiterates Uncompromising Stance**\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed in an interview with Russian state-controlled media that the United States secretly promised Russia that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would not obstruct the peace process. Lavrov falsely asserted that Ukraine's position is the main obstacle to peace, ignoring Russia's full-scale invasion, war crimes, and repeated attacks on Ukrainian territory. He referenced alleged agreements from the August 15, 2024, summit in Anchorage, claiming they were based on 'fair and sustainable resolution' principles, which he said Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined in June 2024 during talks with Russian foreign ministry officials. Lavrov stated that Russia had considered U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff\u2019s proposals but encountered 'certain difficulties' in implementation. He alleged that the U.S. failed to ensure Zelenskyy would not block peace, and claimed that Brussels and London are pressuring Washington to abandon diplomatic efforts and instead fully support military pressure on Russia\u2014labeling this shift as joining the 'war party.' Lavrov reiterated Russia\u2019s non-negotiable positions: the recognition of Russia\u2019s territorial integrity, the legitimacy of the 2014 and 2022 referendums in Crimea, Donbas, and 'Novorossiya,' and the need to eliminate the so-called 'root causes' of the conflict. He declared that Crimea\u2019s status is settled, citing a 2014 referendum in which residents allegedly voted to join Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 10:59 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f 97](https://charter97.org/ru/news/2025/11/9/662344/)\n\n**Diplomat Reveals 'Layer' of Ukrainian Nuclear Weapon Supporters and the Budapest Memorandum's Legacy**\nSergey Batanov, a member of the Pugwash Council and Russian ambassador, stated in an interview with RBK that after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared a non-nuclear status but faced internal resistance from a 'layer' of officials who wanted to retain nuclear weapons. This group, according to Batanov, sought additional guarantees to silence their opposition. These assurances were formalized in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, signed by Ukraine, the U.S., the UK, and Russia, which pledged security guarantees in exchange for Ukraine\u2019s dismantling of its nuclear arsenal. Batanov recalled that Ukraine had initially demanded the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from its territory, but later claimed the weapons were Ukrainian and refused to surrender them. He noted that Ukraine had a nuclear-industrial complex but lacked the physical capability to maintain or operate the weapons. He also warned that Ukrainian officials had attempted to recruit Russian nuclear specialists and acquire technology, raising serious security concerns. In recent years, Ukraine has expressed regret over the memorandum, with President Zelensky stating in February 2022 and December 2024 that the agreement had failed to deliver security guarantees. In a 2025 interview, Zelensky suggested holding those who drafted the memorandum accountable. Batanov dismissed these remarks as 'not very clean propaganda,' emphasizing that Ukraine lacked the technical and logistical capacity to manage nuclear weapons, and that failure to transfer them would have led to severe nuclear safety risks. He concluded that the situation was unambiguous: Ukraine had nuclear weapons on its territory but could not control or use them safely.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 08:06 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/politics/09/11/2025/690e0fd79a794728ffb99006)\n\n**Trump Expresses Desire for Continued Putin Talks in Budapest; Russia Warns of Nuclear Escalation and Reports Advances in Pokrovsk**\nOn November 7, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump stated he hopes to continue holding talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, expressing that he and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n both believe the Russia-Ukraine conflict will end soon. The two leaders met at the White House, discussing trade, energy, and Ukraine-related issues. Trump had previously announced a planned meeting with Putin in Budapest after a call on October 16, but canceled it on October 22, citing lack of progress, while reserving the possibility of a future meeting. On October 27, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov confirmed that while the meeting date remains unclear, the intention to meet persists. Orb\u00e1n reiterated on the same day that the summit will eventually take place in Budapest, with negotiations ongoing. Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said on November 7 that the Kremlin has not commented on Trump\u2019s claims of progress in resolving the conflict, noting that mutual distrust between Russia and Ukraine remains a major obstacle. Peskov confirmed that both Russia and the U.S. still have interest in a summit in Budapest, though it requires careful preparation. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated on November 7 that Russia is closely monitoring U.S. activities in the nuclear domain, including offensive strategic weapons testing, and urged the U.S. to clarify Trump\u2019s October 30 remarks about restarting nuclear tests, warning such actions could provoke international reactions. Putin responded on November 5 that Russia would take proportional measures if the U.S. or other Treaty on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) signatories conduct nuclear tests. Meanwhile, on November 7, the Russian Defense Ministry reported seven coordinated strikes using precision weapons and attack drones targeting Ukrainian industrial facilities, energy infrastructure, transportation networks, military airfields, weapons repair bases, drone assembly and launch sites, and temporary deployment points for Ukrainian forces and foreign mercenaries. Ukrainian General Staff Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi reported during a Supreme Command briefing that Pokrovsk (known as 'Red Army City' in Russian) remains one of the most intense fronts, with Russian forces having penetrated into the urban built-up areas, particularly in the southern suburbs, establishing forward positions to sustain their offensive.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 02:09 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202511083558844693.html)\n\n**Ukraine War Live Updates: Trump Seeks Putin Meeting in Budapest, EU Tightens Visas, Ukraine Reports Gains, Russia Faces Economic Strain**\nUS President Donald Trump continues to pursue a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, proposing Budapest as a potential venue and expressing confidence in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ability to facilitate dialogue, citing Orban's familiarity with Putin. Despite this, the Kremlin, through spokesperson Dmitri Peskow, indicates that a summit is unlikely in the near term, calling for 'careful' preparation and stating it would occur 'at a later time.' The US has imposed sanctions on two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, prompting Bulgaria to take control of Lukoil's Burgas refinery to prevent closure. In response, Trump shows openness to granting Hungary an exception to oil sanctions due to its limited access to alternative energy sources. Meanwhile, Ukraine reports territorial gains near Kharkiv and intensified Russian attacks near Pokrovsk, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirms around 314 Russian soldiers are present. Ukraine has also launched long-range drone strikes on a petrochemical plant in Russia\u2019s Bashkortostan region, 1,300 km from Ukrainian-controlled territory. The EU has tightened visa rules for Russian citizens, restricting multiple-entry visas and citing security risks from the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials highlight a record high in foreign exchange reserves (\u20ac42.8 billion by November 1, 2024), funded by international aid. Russia faces signs of economic downturn, with freight rail volumes dropping by nearly 7% in the first nine months of 2025. The Russian military has reportedly expanded its Southern Military District to include occupied Ukrainian regions, potentially enabling mobilization. The Bundeswehr's General Inspector, Carsten Breuer, calls the war in Ukraine 'our teacher,' emphasizing the need to prepare for future conflicts. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stresses the real threat posed by Russia, citing sabotage, cyberattacks, and drone activity. Ukrainian energy infrastructure continues to be targeted, including a recent attack on Odessa's energy facilities. Russian opposition figures in exile criticize EU sanctions as harmful to ordinary Russians and warn against deepening the suffering of those fleeing the Kremlin. In a separate development, Hungary plans to purchase nuclear fuel rods from the US for its Russian-built reactors.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 11:10 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/21-04-Trump-strebt-weiter-Putin-Treffen-in-Budapest-an-und-sieht-Orban-als-moegliche-Hilfe--article23143824.html)\n\n**Diplomat Reveals 'Layer' of Ukrainian Nuclear Weapon Supporters and the Budapest Memorandum's Legacy**\nSergey Batanov, a member of the Pugwash Council and Russian ambassador, stated in an interview with RBK that after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared a non-nuclear status but faced internal resistance from a 'layer' of officials who wanted to retain nuclear weapons.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated on November 7 that Russia is closely monitoring U.S. activities in the nuclear domain, including offensive strategic weapons testing, and urged the U.S. to clarify Trump\u2019s October 30 remarks about restarting nuclear tests, warning such actions could provoke international reactions. Putin responded on November 5 that Russia would take proportional measures if the U.S. or other Treaty on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) signatories conduct nuclear tests. Meanwhile, on November 7, the Russian Defense Ministry reported seven coordinated strikes using precision weapons and attack drones targeting Ukrainian industrial facilities, energy infrastructure, transportation networks, military airfields, weapons repair bases, drone assembly and launch sites, and temporary deployment points for Ukrainian forces and foreign mercenaries. Ukrainian General Staff Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi reported during a Supreme Command briefing that Pokrovsk (known as 'Red Army City' in Russian) remains one of the most intense fronts, with Russian forces having penetrated into the urban built-up areas, particularly in the southern suburbs, establishing forward positions to sustain their offensive.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 02:09 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202511083558844693.html)\n\n**Ukraine War Live Updates: Trump Seeks Putin Meeting in Budapest, EU Tightens Visas, Ukraine Reports Gains, Russia Faces Economic Strain**\nUS President Donald Trump continues to pursue a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, proposing Budapest as a potential venue and expressing confidence in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ability to facilitate dialogue, citing Orban's familiarity with Putin. Despite this, the Kremlin, through spokesperson Dmitri Peskow, indicates that a summit is unlikely in the near term, calling for 'careful' preparation and stating it would occur 'at a later time.' The US has imposed sanctions on two Russian oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, prompting Bulgaria to take control of Lukoil's Burgas refinery to prevent closure. In response, Trump shows openness to granting Hungary an exception to oil sanctions due to its limited access to alternative energy sources. Meanwhile, Ukraine reports territorial gains near Kharkiv and intensified Russian attacks near Pokrovsk, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky confirms around 314 Russian soldiers are present. Ukraine has also launched long-range drone strikes on a petrochemical plant in Russia\u2019s Bashkortostan region, 1,300 km from Ukrainian-controlled territory. The EU has tightened visa rules for Russian citizens, restricting multiple-entry visas and citing security risks from the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian officials highlight a record high in foreign exchange reserves (\u20ac42.8 billion by November 1, 2024), funded by international aid. Russia faces signs of economic downturn, with freight rail volumes dropping by nearly 7% in the first nine months of 2025. The Russian military has reportedly expanded its Southern Military District to include occupied Ukrainian regions, potentially enabling mobilization. The Bundeswehr's General Inspector, Carsten Breuer, calls the war in Ukraine 'our teacher,' emphasizing the need to prepare for future conflicts. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stresses the real threat posed by Russia, citing sabotage, cyberattacks, and drone activity. Ukrainian energy infrastructure continues to be targeted, including a recent attack on Odessa's energy facilities. Russian opposition figures in exile criticize EU sanctions as harmful to ordinary Russians and warn against deepening the suffering of those fleeing the Kremlin. In a separate development, Hungary plans to purchase nuclear fuel rods from the US for its Russian-built reactors.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 11:10 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/21-04-Trump-strebt-weiter-Putin-Treffen-in-Budapest-an-und-sieht-Orban-als-moegliche-Hilfe--article23143824.html)\n\n**Ukraine Condemns Russian Soldier to Life Imprisonment; Intensified Fighting and Energy Attacks Amid Global Reactions**\nUkraine's courts have sentenced a Russian soldier to life imprisonment for killing a Ukrainian prisoner of war, marking the first such conviction since Russia's invasion. The 27-year-old was found guilty of executing a Ukrainian soldier who surrendered in January 2024. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte urged the defense industry to increase production capacity, emphasizing that political will and demand for defense investments are strong, and promising to accelerate procurement and support innovation. In a major escalation, Ukraine attacked a Russian weapons depot in Donetsk, causing a massive visible shockwave captured on video. Russian forces claim to be advancing in the contested city of Pokrowsk, where heavy house-to-house fighting continues; Ukrainian sources describe the situation as complex and fluid, with no clear control, though Ukrainian forces have reportedly raised their flag in the city center. The Ukrainian military also reported hitting a Russian Shahed drone base in Donetsk, oil refineries in Volgograd, and fuel storage sites on the Crimean Peninsula. Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including a strike on a major power plant in Kostroma, leading to widespread blackouts. In response, Poland launched the largest military training program in its history, aiming to train 400,000 citizens by 2026. Lithuania offered additional gas support, and the EU agreed to include Ukrainian companies in its European Defence Fund. Meanwhile, South African mercenaries in the Donbass region sent distress signals, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to launch an investigation into their recruitment. In unrelated developments, Donald Trump announced plans to restart nuclear weapons testing, and a far-right politician, Tomio Okamura, was elected President of the Czech Parliament, where he referred to Ukrainians as 'Nazis' and questioned the legitimacy of Ukrainian refugees. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned against alleged 'decolonization' of Russia, framing it as an ideological threat to national sovereignty. German Defense Committee Chair Thomas R\u00f6wekamp called for nationwide conscription to strengthen defense readiness. Ukrainian officials emphasized the urgent need for international support to protect energy infrastructure ahead of winter, warning of potential technological catastrophe if critical power plants fail.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 11:10 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/17-24-Ukraine-verurteilt-russischen-Soldaten-zu-lebenslanger-Haft--article23143824.html)\n\n**Zakharova Denounces Tomahawk Deliveries to Ukraine, Experts Challenge Trump's Nuclear Test Claims**\nOfficial Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova stated that supplying Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine is ineffective for conflict resolution and fails to fulfill U.S. pre-election promises. She emphasized that military escalation and arms deliveries, particularly to what she described as a 'terrorist regime,' do not lead to peace and undermine U.S. credibility. Zakharova argued that continued Western military support worsens the situation and blocks political settlement. The article also covers U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement via Truth Social that he had directed the Pentagon to begin nuclear weapon tests 'on equal footing' with Russia and China, citing the U.S. as having the largest nuclear arsenal. However, military expert Alexey Anpilov challenged this claim, noting that Russia holds a lead in strategic warheads (5,600 vs. 5,277) and has a significant advantage in tactical nuclear warheads (up to 10,000 vs. 1,500). He stressed that the U.S. has not conducted nuclear tests since 1992, and resuming them would require years of preparation and would destabilize global strategic security. The U.S. is bound by the 1996 Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which it has signed but not ratified, and experts, including U.S. arms control advocate Daryl Kimball, argue there are no technical, military, or political reasons to resume testing. The article notes that Russia has not declared plans to conduct tests and has consistently emphasized adherence to non-proliferation norms. Additionally, the article discusses the U.S. decision to withhold Tomahawk missile transfers to Ukraine despite Pentagon approval, citing the need to preserve U.S. stockpiles. Trump stated that the missiles are needed for U.S. defense. Analysts, including Dmitry Drobnitsky and Valentin Bogdanov, suggest the Pentagon's approval may be a leak or speculation, and the final decision rests with the White House. The article further notes that Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Tomahawk deployment from Ukraine would directly involve the U.S. in the conflict, damaging U.S.-Russia relations. Finally, the article reports on diplomatic tensions, including the cancellation of a planned U.S.-Russia summit in Budapest, with Western media suggesting Russia issued 'hard demands' on Ukraine, while Moscow insists on guarantees for tangible outcomes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[\u0412\u0437\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434](https://vz.ru/news/2025/11/1/1370892.html)\n\n**Lavrov Offers Russia as Security Guarantor for EU and NATO Amid Distrust Over Past Breaches**\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov proposed that Russia guarantee the security of EU and NATO member states during a conference on Eurasian security in Belarus. According to the state news agency TASS, Lavrov stated, 'We have repeatedly explained that we do not have the intention and never had the intention to attack current NATO or EU member states,' and expressed willingness to embed this position in future security guarantees for this part of Eurasia. However, Lavrov acknowledged that European leaders demand security guarantees 'against Russia, not with Russia,' noting the lack of trust in Russian assurances. This skepticism is rooted in Russia's history of broken commitments: in 1994, Russia signed the Budapest Memorandum, pledging to respect Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and borders in exchange for Ukraine giving up its nuclear arsenal; yet in 2014, Russian-backed forces annexed Crimea, followed by a full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. Similarly, in 2008, Russia launched a large-scale military attack on Georgia under the pretext of protecting Russian-speaking minorities, leading to the de facto annexation of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The experience of former Soviet states further illustrates this distrust\u2014Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania joined NATO in 2004 explicitly citing Russia as an ongoing threat.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 08:38 PM\nSource:[20 Minuten](https://www.20min.ch/story/ukraine-krieg-lawrow-russland-koennte-eu-und-nato-sicherheit-garantieren-103441890)\n\n**Lavrov Unchallenged on YouTube in Hungary: Promoting Russia\u2019s Ukraine Narrative**\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in an hour-long interview with the Hungarian YouTube channel Ultrahang, promoted President Vladimir Putin\u2019s narrative on the Ukraine war, claiming that Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories\u2014including parts of Donbas, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia\u2014are historically Russian. Lavrov stated that the population in these areas, which he referred to as 'liberated,' largely supports joining Russia, and denied allegations of mass child abductions, citing only 339 reported missing persons, most of whom were not children. He criticized Ukraine for banning the Russian language and claimed that Russia\u2019s military actions in Kursk, Belgorod, and other regions were necessary due to Ukrainian attacks. Lavrov asserted that Russia has no intention of withdrawing from occupied territories as long as the 'Nazi regime' remains in Kyiv. He also rejected claims that Budapest is an inappropriate venue for a U.S.-Russia summit due to Russia\u2019s violation of the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, arguing instead that Ukraine violated the agreement by failing to uphold minority rights and democracy. However, experts like Andr\u00e1s R\u00e1cz from the German Council on Foreign Relations accused Lavrov of lying about the Memorandum, noting it explicitly commits signatories to refrain from armed aggression and recognize Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity\u2014contrary to Lavrov\u2019s claim that it only prohibits nuclear weapons.

The report states that drone attacks on residential areas, hospitals, power facilities, humanitarian distribution points, and schools in regions such as Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Mykolaiv\u2014especially from July 2024 onward\u2014constitute the crime against humanity of murder, as they were intentional and part of a coordinated policy to expel civilians. Over 200 civilians have been killed and more than 2,000 injured in these regions since July 2024, according to local authorities cited in the report. The report notes that attacks have caused widespread terror, forcing mass evacuations and leaving some areas nearly empty, with only elderly, disabled, and those unable to flee remaining. The UN Commission on International Inquiry into Ukraine attributes these crimes to 'Russian armed forces' or 'Russian authorities' without naming specific individuals. The report also documents forced deportations of civilians from occupied areas like Zaporizhzhia, often without warning, involving arrests, violence, confiscation of belongings, and forced marches through minefields and combat zones, with some individuals disappearing. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova over the alleged forced transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia, which constitutes a war crime. Russia has rejected the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction, calling the warrants 'scandalous and unacceptable'. CNN has reported extensively on drone attacks on civilians since the 2022 invasion, with recent attacks in northern Ukraine (Chernihiv and Sumy) disrupting electricity during cold weather, and a major evacuation effort in October 2024 from the island of Korabel in Kherson after a key bridge was damaged.

The report states that drone attacks on civilians in southern Ukrainian regions\u2014Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Mykolaiv\u2014since July 2024 have resulted in over 200 civilian deaths and more than 2,000 injuries, with attacks intentionally targeting homes, hospitals, schools, power facilities, and humanitarian distribution points. The commission found these strikes were part of a coordinated policy to render civilian life unbearable and drive people from their homes, leading to areas being nearly vacated. Survivors described being surveilled, chased, and attacked while performing routine activities such as gardening or disposing of trash. The report also documents forcible transfers of civilians from Russian-occupied areas, particularly in Zaporizhzhia oblast, where individuals were deported with little or no notice, forced to walk 10\u201315 kilometers through minefields and active combat zones under gunfire, and subjected to arrests, detentions, violence, and property confiscations prior to deportation. The report does not name individuals but attributes these actions to the 'Russian armed forces' or 'Russian authorities.' The International Criminal Court had previously issued arrest warrants in March 2023 for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova over the alleged forced transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia, a war crime. The Kremlin rejected the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction, calling the move 'outrageous and unacceptable.'

Despite claims by Russian officials, including Dmitry Peskov and Sergey Lavrov, that dialogue with the U.S. remains vital and that Russia has not violated the Budapest Memorandum\u2014arguing it only guarantees no use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states\u2014experts and Western media, including The Telegraph and The New York Times, view Dmitriev\u2019s visit as a reactive move driven by economic pressure. Dmitriev asserted that Russia, the U.S., and Ukraine are 'close' to diplomatic resolution, demanding recognition of Russian interests and the elimination of the conflict\u2019s root causes, while downplaying attacks on civilian infrastructure\u2014such as the strike on a kindergarten in Kharkiv\u2014by calling them 'unfortunate incidents.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian and Western analysts, including military expert Yuriy Fedorenko and political analyst Petro Oleshchuk, argue that Putin is not seeking peace but orchestrating a 'clever game' to create the illusion of diplomacy, divide Ukraine\u2019s Western allies, and maintain territorial gains. Oleshchuk warns that any talk of peace from Moscow would be a strategic ploy to weaken international unity, especially as energy warfare intensifies and winter approaches. The U.S. and Ukraine are expected to face increased pressure, with Moscow using issues like the return of abducted Ukrainian children as propaganda tools.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 06:36 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/ato/hitraya-igra-putina-pochemu-rossiya-ne-hochet-mira-i-gotovit-lovushku-dlya-partnerov-ukrainy-2944019.html)\n\n**Lavrov Claims Russia Not Violating Budapest Memorandum, Despite Documented Aggression Against Ukraine**\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia does not believe its actions against Ukraine violate the Budapest Memorandum, asserting that the agreement only guarantees non-use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Lavrov emphasized that the memorandum's core commitments were limited to nuclear security assurances, not territorial integrity or sovereignty. Russia claims that parallel to the memorandum, a declaration on OSCE principles\u2014such as minority rights, democracy, and freedom of speech\u2014was agreed upon, which Moscow alleges Ukraine has violated, justifying its aggression. The Budapest Memorandum, signed on December 5, 1994, obligated Russia, the UK, and the US to respect Ukraine\u2019s independence, sovereignty, and existing borders, refrain from threats or use of force, and avoid economic coercion. However, since Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it has systematically violated these terms. International observers consistently affirm that Russia has destroyed the security framework established by the memorandum, undermining the global non-proliferation regime. Lavrov\u2019s claims of non-involvement in violations contradict documented military actions and widespread international condemnation.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 09:55 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/lavrov-zayavila-shcho-rosiya-porushuvala-1761515052.html)\n\n**Russia Encircles Over 10,000 Ukrainian Soldiers, Seeks Surrender Without Further Fighting**\nAccording to Kir\u00edl Dm\u00edtriev, a Kremlin envoy for economic cooperation with the United States, Russia has encircled over 10,000 Ukrainian soldiers in eastern Ukraine, with 5,000 trapped in K\u00fapiansk and 5,500 in the Pokrovsk area\u2014key locations for Moscow\u2019s goal of controlling the entire Donb\u00e1s region. Dm\u00edtriev stated that Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed military commanders to offer surrender terms to the encircled Ukrainian troops to 'minimize' casualties. He reported informing U.S. officials about the operation during a visit to Washington, D.C., where he also announced the successful launch of a new-generation nuclear-powered cruise missile, Burev\u00e9stnik. Dm\u00edtriev claimed that a meeting between U.S. congressmen and Russian deputies is imminent and expressed confidence that diplomatic efforts between Russia, the U.S., and Ukraine could lead to a resolution 'in a reasonable timeframe.' He emphasized that Russia is willing to provide security guarantees to Ukraine only if Kyiv agrees to neutrality and accepts Russian control over four annexed regions. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump, who canceled a planned Budapest summit with Putin due to Russia\u2019s refusal to declare a ceasefire, reiterated that he will not meet Putin until a deal is on the table.

In 1994, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum, agreeing to give up its third-largest nuclear arsenal\u20141,900 warheads and 176 intercontinental ballistic missiles\u2014in exchange for security assurances from the U.S., Russia, and the UK. However, the document was not a legally binding treaty but a 'memorandum' offering only 'security assurances,' not guarantees. Despite receiving economic aid, Ukraine did not secure binding commitments to defend its territorial integrity. Russia has since violated the memorandum by invading Crimea in 2014 and annexing territory, actions that breach the UN Charter. The ICC has issued a warrant for Putin\u2019s arrest, and Russia claims the memorandum lacks legal force. The 1994 agreement is now seen as a failure, and Ukraine\u2019s current government under Zelensky remains deeply wary of being excluded from negotiations in Budapest\u2014this time without even a seat at the table\u2014while facing renewed threats from Russia and potential mediation by Trump.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 05:02 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/historiayvida/historia-contemporanea/20251022/11177993/malos-recuerdos-budapest-ucrania-engano-1994-mediacion-trump.html)\n\n**Billionaire Branson: Ignoring the 1994 Budapest Memorandum Undermines Trust in Future U.S.-Russia Deals**\nBritish billionaire Richard Branson urges the United States and the United Kingdom to fulfill their obligations under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum and fully support Ukraine.

Branson warns that if the U.S. and Russia continue to ignore the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine cannot reasonably expect to trust any future agreement signed in the same city. He notes that the same city\u2014Budapest\u2014was where the U.S., UK, and Russia met 31 years ago to give Ukraine ironclad guarantees of territorial integrity in exchange for Ukraine giving up one-third of the world\u2019s nuclear weapons (those of Russia). Branson emphasizes that Ukraine trusted the West by surrendering its nuclear arsenal and joining the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He asserts that Putin effectively breached the memorandum over 20 years ago by annexing Crimea and that Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022 confirmed his imperial ambitions.

In 1994, Ukraine gave up its nuclear arsenal in exchange for the Budapest Memorandum, which pledged respect for its borders and non\u2011use of force. In 1997, the Ukraine\u2011Russia Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership Treaty was signed, obligating mutual respect of borders, non\u2011interference and non\u2011use of force. Yet Russia violated these agreements in 2014 by annexing Crimea and supporting separatists in Donbas, and again in 2022 with a full\u2011scale invasion, while Western guarantors imposed only sanctions and condemnation. The treaty remained formally in force until 2019, even as Russia continued to occupy Crimea. The Minsk agreements of 2014/2015, brokered by Germany and France, were never implemented. Europe has failed to admit Ukraine to NATO, hesitated to supply weapons capable of striking deep into Russian territory, and has supplied only defensive armaments, leaving Ukraine in a position of passive defense. The article argues that paper guarantees do not protect sovereignty unless translated into concrete actions such as NATO membership, a real defence alliance, or the presence of deterrent forces on the ground. It calls on Europe to choose between proving itself as a protector of values and freedom or remaining a cowardly spectator, letting history record that the continent left Ukraine to face its fate alone.

The United States confirmed its willingness to help draft security guarantees, and President\u202fZelensky said he is ready to meet his Russian counterpart once an agreement is reached. The piece explains the background of the 5\u202fDecember\u202f1994 Budapest Memorandum, signed by Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom, later joined by France and China. The memorandum gave Ukraine 1,900 strategic and 2,500 tactical nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union, but Ukraine renounced nuclear weapons and joined the Non\u2011Proliferation Treaty. In return, signatories pledged to \"respect the independence, sovereignty and existing borders of Ukraine\" and to \"refrain from threatening or using force against Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity or political independence.\" The article quotes Marie\u202fDumoulin, director of a program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, who said, 'Mais il faut bien voir que pour les n\u00e9gociateurs am\u00e9ricains et britanniques notamment, le principal enjeu \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, ce n'est pas la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la souverainet\u00e9 de l'Ukraine.'

The article argues that the memorandum lacked positive security guarantees, making it vulnerable to breaches such as Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergu\u00e9i Lavrov stated, 'We cannot accept that now they propose to resolve collective security issues without Russia. It won't work.' Moscow recalls that Russian recognition of Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union depends on Ukraine not joining any military bloc and maintaining its non-nuclear status. However, it forgets that Kiev renounced its strategic arsenal in 1994 in exchange for collective security guarantees contemplated in the Budapest Memorandum, which Moscow violated in 2022. Lavrov responded to a question about guarantees for Kiev in the form of European troop deployments and US planes by saying that Moscow does not exceed itself in exposing its legitimate interests and will defend them 'firmly and rigorously.' He added, 'I am sure that the West, and especially the United States, understands perfectly that seriously debating security issues without Russia is a utopia, a path to nowhere.' Lavrov recalled that in April 2022, Ukraine proposed a peace agreement to Russia that included renouncing NATO and nuclear weapons. He explained that Moscow was willing to sign a document on guarantees that included all permanent members of the UN Security Council and other countries like Germany or Turkey. Lavrov criticized European leaders for debating the possibility of deploying troops in Ukrainian territory to prevent future invasions, saying, 'We only see a very aggressive escalation of the situation, clumsy and unethical attempts to modify the Trump administration's position and personally that of the US president.' He also described the proposal for a ceasefire without the Western countries suspending arms supplies to Kiev as 'a policy of confrontation.' The Russian president, Vlad\u00edmir Putin, had previously expressed willingness to study the granting of security guarantees to Kiev, but hours before the meeting with Trump, Moscow rejected any NATO troop deployment. 'We confirm our categorical rejection of any scenario that provides for the presence of a NATO military contingent in Ukraine, which implies an uncontrolled escalation of the conflict with unpredictable consequences,' said Mar\u00eda Zaj\u00e1rova, Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in a statement.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 06:26 PM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/internacional/rusia-rechaza-garantias-seguridad-colectivas-paises-europeos-ucrania.html)\n\n**Tusk Opposes Zelensky-Putin Talks in Hungary, Citing Budapest Memorandum**\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has spoken out against holding negotiations between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary. He mentioned the Budapest Memorandum, signed in 1994, which provided Ukraine with security guarantees in exchange for giving up its nuclear arsenal. Tusk wrote on X, 'Budapest? Not everyone remembers, but in 1994, Ukraine already received territorial integrity guarantees from the US, Russia, and the UK in Budapest. Maybe I'm crazy, but this time I'd try to find another location.' The Budapest Memorandum was signed on December 5, 1994, by Ukraine, the US, the UK, and Russia after Ukraine joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The document confirmed the guarantor states' commitment to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and existing borders, refrain from threats or use of force against it, and economic pressure. Ukraine, in turn, renounced its third-largest nuclear arsenal, which remained on its territory after the Soviet Union's collapse. The memorandum did not provide mechanisms for enforcement or clear legal guarantees, only political commitments. The annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 and the full-scale aggression against Ukraine in 2022 have raised questions about the document's effectiveness and the overall effectiveness of international security guarantees.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/world/geopolitics/peregovori-putina-i-zelenskogo-donald-tusk-proti-peremovin-mizh-ukrajinoyu-i-rf-v-ugorshchini-50538572.html)\n\n**Tusk Opposes Zelensky-Putin Talks in Hungary, Citing Budapest Memorandum**\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has spoken out against holding talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Hungary.

Meanwhile, a meeting between Zelensky and Putin is being discussed, with Hungary potentially hosting the talks. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has confirmed that Putin is willing to meet with Zelensky, and a high-ranking US official has suggested that the meeting could take place in Hungary. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed holding peace talks in Geneva, which could serve as a neutral platform for the summit.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 20, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/world/geopolitics/peregovory-putina-i-zelenskogo-donald-tusk-protiv-peregovorov-mezhdu-ukrainoy-i-rf-v-vengrii-50538572.html)\n\n**The End of Putin's Impunity**\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has reason to be concerned. Recent attacks on Ukrainian civilians have resulted in a significant increase in deaths and destruction, with 232 civilians killed and 1343 injured in June, according to the UN's HRMMU. This surge in violence may be a turning point for Ukraine, as President Donald Trump has signaled a change in his position, potentially leading to the US providing lethal rockets to Ukraine. Additionally, Trump has threatened to impose new sanctions on Russia, in response to Putin's failure to negotiate a peaceful agreement. Furthermore, the Ukrainian parliament has voted to create a special tribunal, in collaboration with the Council of Europe, to prosecute Russia for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. This tribunal will allow for the investigation of high-ranking Russian officials, including Putin, for their role in the aggression. The Council of Europe has already suspended Russia's representation in February 2022, and subsequently excluded them in March 2022. The special tribunal is a culmination of three years of pressure to hold the Kremlin accountable for its actions in Ukraine. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, Russia's children's rights commissioner, for their role in the forced deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. The tribunal is necessary, as the ICC cannot prosecute political and military leaders for the crime of aggression, due to Russia's non-participation in the Rome Statute and the veto power of Russia in the UN Security Council. The special tribunal will allow for the investigation of the main crime of Putin: planning, preparation, and execution of the invasion, occupation, and attempted annexation of Ukraine, starting with the invasion of Crimea in 2014. This move sends a clear signal that Putin and his regime will not be immune to prosecution for their crimes. 'The era of Putin's impunity is coming to an end,' said the article. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 17, 2025 11:42 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f 97](https://charter97.org/ru/news/2025/7/17/648569/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014ranging from nuclear nonproliferation, security and defense policy, international relations theory, political science models, and Eastern European area studies\u2014there is overwhelming consensus that the probability Ukraine will launch a nuclear weapons program before 2026 is extremely low. Base rates for NPT-compliant, Western-aided states initiating a weapons program under intense international scrutiny are nearly zero, especially within the remaining short timeframe (less than 14 months, in some cases less than 2 months). While Ukraine\u2019s existential security threats, failed guarantees (Budapest Memorandum), and some latent technical capacity moderately increase theoretical incentives, these are decisively outweighed by several major constraining factors: intense reliance on Western military and economic aid, robust IAEA and international monitoring, the risk of devastating diplomatic isolation or sanctions, technical and bureaucratic barriers to rapid program initiation, and the likelihood of severe Russian escalation if any such move occurs. No expert identified credible public or official reports of a Ukrainian nuclear weapons program or signs of imminent acquisition. Most Yes scenarios require extreme \"black swan\" events such as catastrophic loss of all Western support or existential state collapse, for which there is no current indication. Probabilities assigned cluster between 1% and 4%, with a clear lean toward the lower end; all experts note rhetorical references to nuclearization remain just that\u2014rhetoric. In summary, nearly all lines of analysis converge on the conclusion that a Ukrainian nuclear weapons program being credibly reported before 2026 is exceedingly improbable barring transformational, highly visible shocks.",
