Importantly, Politico\u2019s average is backward-looking and smooths shocks, but current numbers are bad enough that sustained near-4th performance can translate into a fourth place in the aggregate.

I am revising downward by 5 percentage points, landing at 80%, which is still bold and reflects the overwhelming\u2014but not absolute\u2014likelihood of Labour hitting 4th in Politico's average before January 1, 2026.",

However, very few group members are genuinely bearish, and the consensus\u2014especially among those grounded in panel and time series analysis\u2014is that the magnitude, consistency, and breadth of Labour's collapse, coupled with ongoing leadership and policy disasters, makes a 4th-place outcome not just plausible but highly likely. Critiques of base-rate conservatism are persuasive: this is not simply a cyclical setback but an unprecedented and durable collapse and, structurally, Labour faces weeks of continuing negative triggers (post-budget, potential leadership coup). Only a true statistical fluke or unusually strong mean-reversion (for which there is little current evidence) could keep Labour out of 4th in the aggregate at any point. The very tight traffic jam of polling means that measurement error is as likely to tip Labour *down* as to cushion them, and the group discussion correctly notes this. Since my original probability was already at 93%, I see only the slimmest justification to nudge it further\u2014maximal boldness would overstate our certainty in an inherently chaotic period.

The point that multi-poll synchrony is required, and that even a tiny rebound by Labour or a slight underperformance by Reform or the Greens can keep Labour at third in the aggregate, is valid and supported by UK polling history, where averages often lag headline drama. At the same time, defenses from panel survey and Westminster system specialists reaffirmed that the collapse is so deep and persistent that the odds remain extremely high for at least one period at fourth place. Balancing this, I see a slight reason to moderate extremity\u2014not due to more doubt about collapse, but to better reflect methodological conservatism and avoid overconfidence in forecasting team contest standards.

However, a common critique of maximalist >90% probabilities is the slight but real risk of mean reversion: leadership change, 'dead-cat bounce', or temporary opposition underperformance (noted by aggregation and survey methods experts) could pull Labour back up for part of the window, especially given historical party floor effects. The danger is less that Labour avoids fourth entirely, and more that the window is brief or messy in the averages.

Panel Survey Design and Polling Aggregation experts persuasively emphasized that even with decisive poll swings, averages can resist the headline disaster narrative, especially if Labour receives even a modest post-budget or post-leadership challenge bounce.

My own theory of class realignment is reinforced by the observation that not only have historical base rates been shattered, but the mechanical quirks of Politico's poll averaging (while a brake on transient outliers) are in fact vulnerable given the current highly synchronized, multi-poll collapse of Labour's support. Critiques remind us that an improbable recovery is possible if either the Greens or Reform falter, but crucially, the 'traffic jam' effect that could save Labour is, by the group consensus, more likely to work against them given the direction and strength of current opinion trends. The deliberation further discounts the chance of a swift Labour stabilization, with no convincing positive catalyst in sight before January 1, 2026.

While the argument for a 'perfect storm' of social realignment and trust collapse remains strong, the key uncertainty is whether volatility and fractionality among challenger parties (notably, Greens or Lib Dems) could result in Labour scraping by at third in the average for a large part of the resolution window, or brief dips to 4th being insufficient for resolution if averages rebound.

The potential challenge could be triggered two weeks after Rachel Reeves, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, delivers her budget statement to the House of Commons on November 26, 2025. Reeves is expected to announce unpopular tax increases to address the budget deficit, which could fuel internal dissent. Potential challengers include Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Wes Streeting. However, Starmer is reportedly determined to resist such efforts, with one unnamed minister stating that it would be 'madness' to challenge him just 17 months after he led Labour to a general election victory. Critics claim Starmer's office has entered 'a defensive mode' and that internal challenges will not help the government overcome its current political difficulties. A November 2025 Ipsos poll cited by The Daily Telegraph found that only 20% of respondents approve of Starmer\u2019s performance, while 60% view it negatively. Reeves herself acknowledged on November 4 that Labour may break its pre-election promise not to raise income, VAT, and social security taxes due to significant external economic pressures, including US tariffs and the war in Ukraine.

A uniform national swing calculation suggests that if a general election were held today, Reform UK would have a one-in-five chance of securing a parliamentary majority. If Reform UK allied with the Conservatives, their combined chances of achieving a majority would rise to four-in-five. In contrast, the combined centre-left parties have only a one-in-30 chance of winning. The decline is most pronounced among younger voters: Labour's support among those under 35 has dropped from nearly half in the 2024 election to around one-quarter today, as young voters are splitting rightward toward Reform UK and leftward toward the Greens. Reform UK is now the most popular party among those aged 45 to 64 and has also gained dominance among the Conservative Party\u2019s most reliable base: pensioners.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[Donald J.

Among 2024 Labour voters, 33% support his resignation, while 52% want him to remain. Similarly, 57% believe Chancellor Rachel Reeves should resign, versus 19% who want her to stay, with 24% undecided; among Labour voters, 42% support her staying, while 38% want her to resign. Starmer and Reeves are the least trusted politicians on economic matters, with net trust ratings of -41% and -48%, respectively. Even among Labour voters, only 40% trust Reeves on financial issues, while 48% do not. Ahead of the Autumn Budget, 58% of the public expect Labour\u2019s fiscal decisions to be unfair, and 77% anticipate tax increases despite Labour\u2019s 2024 manifesto ruling out major tax hikes. Sixty-one percent believe it would be wrong for Reeves to raise income tax, VAT, or national insurance, while only 19% think it would be right. Fewer than a quarter (22%) believe Starmer and Labour were open and honest about the UK\u2019s economic challenges before the 2024 election, while 61% say they were not. Half of the public suspect Reeves intended to raise taxes all along, with only 20% attributing the decision to worsening economic conditions. Reeves\u2019 approval rating has dropped to net -47%, and she has fallen to net -17% among Labour voters. Starmer\u2019s approval remains at net -45%, Badenoch at net -17%, and Farage\u2019s rating has improved to -10% (+4). Farage holds a +3% lead over Starmer in preferred Prime Minister rankings.

Despite Labour's 2024 election promise of economic growth that would allow investment in infrastructure, housing, healthcare, and wages without raising taxes, the government has failed to deliver on this pledge. Sixteen months after taking power, economic indicators show no significant improvement: public debt has reached \u20ac3 trillion (100% of GDP), with \u20ac11 billion in monthly interest payments. The government admits the economy has not responded as expected, forcing a tax hike to avoid bankruptcy. Starmer previously vowed not to raise taxes, especially on income, social security, and VAT, and even pledged to protect fiscal reserves. However, he broke this promise by increasing employer social security contributions, which reduced employment. The government now blames the UK\u2019s financial crisis on Brexit, claiming it cost 4% of GDP and \u20ac80 billion annually, though it avoids calling Brexit a mistake. It also attributes economic strain to Trump\u2019s tariffs, Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, and the 2008 financial crisis. Despite these external factors, public trust has eroded: Labour\u2019s support has dropped to 15%, tied with the Conservatives, behind Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens. The article criticizes Labour for failing to deliver promised growth, maintaining a bloated welfare state costing \u20ac350 billion annually, with 1 in 5 working-age Britons not in employment, 250 billion euros in annual benefits, 4 million reporting health issues, 4.5 million children in poverty, and 63,000 university graduates entering unemployment. The government\u2019s narrative of blaming the world for its failures is dismissed as unconvincing, as voters hold Starmer personally responsible.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20251110/11246701/mundo-culpa.html)\n\n**BBC: Starmer's Allies May Attempt to Oust Him in December**\nAccording to BBC sources, members of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party may attempt to remove him as party leader as early as December 2025.

A uniform national swing calculation suggests that if a general election were held today, Reform UK would have a one-in-five chance of securing a parliamentary majority. If Reform UK allied with the Conservatives, their combined chances of achieving a majority would rise to four-in-five. In contrast, the combined centre-left parties have only a one-in-30 chance of winning. The decline is most pronounced among younger voters: Labour's support among those under 35 has dropped from nearly half in the 2024 election to around one-quarter today, as young voters are splitting rightward toward Reform UK and leftward toward the Greens. Reform UK is now the most popular party among those aged 45 to 64 and has also gained dominance among the Conservative Party\u2019s most reliable base: pensioners.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[Donald J.

Farage criticized both the European Union and UK governments for imposing excessive regulation, stating that '50 years of endless red tape' from Brussels and the expansion of regulatory power under Tony Blair have made life 'a misery' for small businesses. He emphasized that small businesses\u2014comprising 99% of UK firms and half the economy\u2014have been neglected, with regulators seen as adversarial rather than supportive. Farage highlighted that big businesses dominate political discourse, while small entrepreneurs lack a voice. He pledged to abolish IR35 rules, raise the VAT threshold, and create a policy board to shape Reform\u2019s small business agenda ahead of the next election. Kevin Byrne, founder of Checkatrade, joined Reform UK, citing 'desperation and disappointment' with successive governments, and declared that 'when Britain's small businesses thrive, Britain will thrive.' Labour responded by calling Reform\u2019s policies a 'disaster' for small businesses, accusing Farage of undermining trade deals and clean energy jobs. Polling data showed Farage is more trusted on the economy than Keir Starmer or Rachel Reeves, with a net trust score of -19, compared to Starmer\u2019s -41 and Reeves\u2019s -48. The event was supported by a \u00a3200,000 donation from Lord Bamford, a Conservative ally, who said both Reform and the Conservatives recognize small businesses as the 'backbone of our economy.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News UK](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/eu-makes-life-misery-businesses-124549399.html)\n\n**More than half of voters want Starmer and Reeves to resign - London Business News | Londonlovesbusiness.com**\nA November 2025 Opinium poll reveals that a majority of UK voters\u201456%\u2014believe Prime Minister Keir Starmer should resign, compared to 26% who want him to stay, with 19% undecided.

Similarly, 57% believe Chancellor Rachel Reeves should resign, versus 19% who want her to stay, with 24% undecided; among Labour voters, 42% support her staying, while 38% want her to resign. Starmer and Reeves are the least trusted politicians on economic matters, with net trust ratings of -41% and -48%, respectively. Even among Labour voters, only 40% trust Reeves on financial issues, while 48% do not. Ahead of the Autumn Budget, 58% of the public expect Labour\u2019s fiscal decisions to be unfair, and 77% anticipate tax increases despite Labour\u2019s 2024 manifesto ruling out major tax hikes.

Despite Labour's 2024 election promise of economic growth that would allow investment in infrastructure, housing, healthcare, and wages without raising taxes, the government has failed to deliver on this pledge. Sixteen months after taking power, economic indicators show no significant improvement: public debt has reached \u20ac3 trillion (100% of GDP), with \u20ac11 billion in monthly interest payments. The government admits the economy has not responded as expected, forcing a tax hike to avoid bankruptcy. Starmer previously vowed not to raise taxes, especially on income, social security, and VAT, and even pledged to protect fiscal reserves. However, he broke this promise by increasing employer social security contributions, which reduced employment. The government now blames the UK\u2019s financial crisis on Brexit, claiming it cost 4% of GDP and \u20ac80 billion annually, though it avoids calling Brexit a mistake. It also attributes economic strain to Trump\u2019s tariffs, Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, and the 2008 financial crisis. Despite these external factors, public trust has eroded: Labour\u2019s support has dropped to 15%, tied with the Conservatives, behind Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens. The article criticizes Labour for failing to deliver promised growth, maintaining a bloated welfare state costing \u20ac350 billion annually, with 1 in 5 working-age Britons not in employment, 250 billion euros in annual benefits, 4 million reporting health issues, 4.5 million children in poverty, and 63,000 university graduates entering unemployment. The government\u2019s narrative of blaming the world for its failures is dismissed as unconvincing, as voters hold Starmer personally responsible.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[LaVanguardia](https://www.lavanguardia.com/internacional/20251110/11246701/mundo-culpa.html)\n\n**Majority of Brits want Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves to resign - poll**\nA November 2025 Opinium poll reveals that a majority of Britons want both Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chancellor Rachel Reeves to resign, with 56% supporting Starmer's resignation compared to 26% wanting him to stay, and 57% wanting Reeves to step down versus 19% in favor of her remaining.

This rise follows a sharp increase in membership, surpassing that of both Labour and the Conservatives, and a jump from 6.4% support at the last general election to the late teens in current polls. The party now has four MPs and around 800 councillors, and could win up to 42 seats in the Commons if a general election were held today. Factors behind the surge include Labour's unpopularity under Keir Starmer, the Liberal Democrats' positioning as a centre-left alternative, and the lack of a fully established left-wing challenger like the 'Your Party' grouping. Polanski, known for his media presence, charisma, and social media savvy, has shifted the party's focus from traditional environmental issues to broader social justice and inequality, resonating with disillusioned Labour voters. He has also avoided entanglement in the Corbyn-Sultana political drama. While the Greens are seen as offering 'strong meat' to disaffected voters\u2014similar to Reform Party\u2019s appeal\u2014critics note a lack of detailed policy backing for their radical proposals.

After leading the Labour Party to a decisive victory in the 2024 general election\u2014ending 14 years of Conservative rule with a 19.9 percentage point swing\u2014the government has seen a dramatic drop in popularity. A recent Ipsos survey shows only 22% of Britons would vote for Labour if an election were held today, and 80% are dissatisfied with Starmer\u2019s leadership. This rapid decline is unprecedented in modern British political history. While Labour\u2019s own voters increasingly believe the government is making poor decisions, the party has not regained support from former Conservative voters. Instead, voters have shifted toward Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which has surged in popularity, particularly on immigration policy. Farage, a key figure in Brexit, is now projected to become prime minister in a hypothetical election, marking the first time in over a century that a non-Labour or non-Conservative leader would hold the office. Starmer has criticized Farage\u2019s populism, calling it a 'battle for the soul of the nation,' but public concern remains low. Internal dissent also exists within Labour, as Manchester\u2019s mayor Andy Burnham has launched an alternative political platform advocating for tax reform, more public housing, and electoral system changes. A YouGov poll indicates that Labour voters prefer Burnham over Starmer. Despite criticism from the left for being too cautious on redistribution, Starmer has maintained the Conservative-era income tax levels and implemented austerity measures on social programs due to economic constraints. Meanwhile, defence spending is expected to rise significantly. Starmer previously stated it would take a decade to rebuild the country, and he has until at least 2029 for the next general election.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 04:21 PM\nSource:[Aftenposten Interaktiv](https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/4Bya5e/fra-valgskred-til-historisk-upopulaer-paa-15-maaneder-britene-har-vendt-seg-mot-sin-leder-paa-rekordtid)\n\n**How did Keir Starmer go from a landslide win to Britain's most unpopular PM in a year?**\nKeir Starmer, who led the Labour Party to a historic landslide victory in July 2024 with 411 seats and a 174-seat majority, has become the most unpopular British prime minister in modern polling history within just 15 months. Polls show only 13% of voters are satisfied with his leadership, with 79% dissatisfied\u2014surpassing even Liz Truss\u2019s record-low approval during her 44-day tenure. Despite Labour\u2019s electoral dominance, the victory was built on only about one-third of the national vote and low voter turnout, resulting in a 'loveless' landslide, according to polling expert John Curtice. Starmer\u2019s government faces a fragile economic backdrop: high inflation, stagnant wages, and a fiscal gap left by prior Conservative tax cuts. With a pledge not to raise taxes on 'working people,' Labour resorted to unpopular revenue measures, undermining public confidence. Starmer\u2019s lack of ideological identity\u2014described as pragmatic and rule-bound, with no favorite novel or political hero\u2014has left voters unclear on what he stands for, fueling political mystery and weakening party cohesion. The rise of Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has surged to 30\u201335% support, overtaking Labour\u2019s 20\u201323%, while a left-wing breakaway, 'Your Party,' led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, could attract up to one in five 2024 Labour voters. Internal turmoil includes the resignation of deputy leader Angela Rayner over tax underpayment, a cabinet reshuffle, and speculation around potential challengers like Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. Labour\u2019s support has dropped from 37.5% in July 2024 to 23.3% by June 2025\u2014a decline of over 14 points, the steepest in recent history. Despite policy moves such as suspending family reunion for asylum seekers and announcing Palestinian statehood recognition, Labour\u2019s approval remains low, with net favourability at -47%, worse than most international peers except French President Emmanuel Macron (-55%). The next general election is scheduled for 2029, but Starmer\u2019s ability to lead Labour to victory is now in serious doubt.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 10:23 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/keir-starmer-uk-most-unpopular-prime-minister-record-13938452.html)\n\n**Keir Starmer is polling as the UK&#x2019;s most unpopular prime minister on record.

Just 13% of voters express satisfaction with Starmer, while 79% are dissatisfied. This marks the worst-ever decline in support for a newly elected government, as noted by political analyst John Curtice. Despite Labour's landslide victory in the 2024 general election\u2014winning a parliamentary majority with only about one-third of the national vote\u2014low voter turnout meant that only about one in five Britons actually voted for Starmer. Since taking office, Labour's support has plummeted to around 20% in recent polls, while Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has surged to approximately 35%, matching Labour\u2019s 2024 share. This shift has sparked fears within Labour that Reform UK could secure a majority in the next election, due in 2029.

Analysts like John Curtice attribute the collapse to Labour\u2019s lack of a clear ideological identity, dubbed 'Starmerism,' leaving voters uncertain about his vision. Labour\u2019s economic strategy has been hampered by its pre-election pledge to avoid income tax increases, forcing reliance on unpopular revenue measures. Policies such as ending universal winter fuel subsidies and cutting benefits for disabled people\u2014later reversed after backlash\u2014damaged credibility and raised borrowing costs. The immigration debate has intensified, with violent protests and a London anti-immigration march attended by Elon Musk, who urged resistance. Starmer has adopted a tough stance on illegal immigration, warning of Britain becoming 'an island of strangers,' but critics accuse him of mimicking Farage\u2019s rhetoric. In response, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned Reform UK\u2019s push to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR) as 'racist,' though Labour\u2019s own plan to extend ILR eligibility from five to ten years has drawn criticism. Labour\u2019s long-term agenda\u2014building 1.5 million homes, reforming taxation, and rebuilding public services\u2014faces skepticism, especially as voters increasingly favor immediate change over gradual renewal. Despite international progress, including restored EU relations and a 'one-in-one-out' migrant return deal, domestic frustration persists. Starmer\u2019s conference speech framed the nation\u2019s future as a choice between 'decency' and 'division,' but many question whether the public will endure a decade of austerity for a 'fairer country.' As Hermer, the attorney general, stated, 'the British public will be able to smell a fraud'\u2014a warning that Labour\u2019s long-term renewal strategy may not be enough to counter the appeal of Reform UK\u2019s more immediate, combative politics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 05:21 PM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https://kesq.com/news/national-world/cnn-world/2025/09/30/keir-starmer-is-polling-as-the-uks-most-unpopular-prime-minister-on-record-where-did-it-all-go-wrong/)\n\n**Starmer hits record low in UK opinion poll  --  RT World News**\nAn Ipsos poll of 1,157 British adults released Sunday found that only 13% of Britons are satisfied with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, while 79% are dissatisfied \u2013 a record low for any UK prime minister polled by Ipsos since 1977.

The Liberal Democrats, Greens, Reform UK, SNP, Plaid Cymru, and DUP also contested the election. The House of Lords, an appointed upper chamber, does not play a role in the electoral process.

The prime minister, who leads the executive branch and appoints the Cabinet, serves a five-year term. Key issues in the election included the economy (52% of voters), healthcare (50%), immigration and asylum (40%), housing (24%), and the environment (20%), according to a YouGov survey conducted on June 24, 2024. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland hold partial legislative authority. The current parliamentary breakdown prior to the election was: Conservatives \u2013 344 seats (52.9%), Labour \u2013 205 seats (31.5%), SNP \u2013 43 seats (6.6%), Liberal Democrats \u2013 15 seats (2.3%), and 43 seats held by nine other parties and independents.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 04, 2024 09:44 AM\nSource:[india.com](https://www.india.com/news/world/uk-general-elections-2024-heres-how-president-is-elected-election-process-parties-and-key-contenders-7059030/)\n\n",

    "summary": "The expert forecasts are nearly unanimous in anticipating that the Labour Party will fall to 4th place or worse in Politico's UK polling average at least once before January 1, 2026, a scenario viewed as almost unthinkable in previous UK politics but now regarded as highly likely due to extraordinary circumstances. All forecasters note that Labour is currently, or has recently been, in 4th position in multiple reputable national polls, trailing Reform UK, Conservatives, and Greens, with some even putting Labour as low as fifth. Key factors driving these predictions are Labour's unprecedented collapse in support post-landslide (often cited as 15\u201320% in recent polls), record unpopularity for PM Keir Starmer and key party leadership, public anger over tax increases and perceived broken promises, internal party strife fueling leadership instability, and a highly fragmented opposition where multiple challenger parties (Greens, Reform UK, and sometimes Lib Dems) are credible and competitive.\n\nForecasters across disciplines\u2014election modeling, public opinion, party systems, sociology, and UK political studies\u2014all recognize the extraordinary nature of the event and stress that while the historical base rate would make such a result seem almost impossible, current social, economic, and political dynamics have broken the usual resilience of a major party. The consensus is that Politico\u2019s poll-of-polls average, while smoothing volatility, is likely to capture Labour at 4th or worse for at least a brief window, especially following the late November budget and likely December leadership drama. While some experts note methodological caveats (e.g., potential poll lag, mean-reversion, brief recoveries), these are not considered strong enough to outweigh the current momentum and breadth of the polling collapse.\n\nProbabilities given by the experts are unusually high for a previously unprecedented political event, ranging from about 65% (noting aggregation lag, historical inertia, and potential for short-term recovery) to over 90% (where experts see the convergence of multiple polling averages and negative triggers as overwhelming). The modal forecast is in the 80\u201390% range, reflecting the breadth and consistency of the negative news, the depth of Labour's collapse, and the number of opposition parties able to outpoll Labour simultaneously. The primary path to a 'No' outcome (Labour never reaching 4th in Politico's average) is a sudden, unexpected rebound\u2014possibly from a new leader or a collapse in Green/Reform momentum\u2014which few experts consider likely in the short period to 2026. In summary, forecasters see Labour polling 4th as a historic event rapidly moving from 'almost impossible' to 'highly probable' within the 7-week window before question closure.",
