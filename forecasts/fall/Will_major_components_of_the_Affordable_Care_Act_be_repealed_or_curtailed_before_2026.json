Today, ACA coverage is at record highs, and Republican lawmakers\u2014including leadership\u2014publicly acknowledge the political liability. With Democrats emboldened by recent electoral wins and locked in on ACA defense as a core issue, Republicans face substantial risks of backlash if they push for deep cuts, especially so close to the 2026 midterms. Furthermore, reconciliation offers only one legislative window per cycle, and GOP priorities are split between tax, spending, and border/immigration issues. Budget-driven administrative tightening (such as increased Medicaid red tape) may proceed, but are unlikely to add to three pillars sufficient for a 'Yes' under resolution criteria. The path to a 'No' remains the path of least resistance; core ACA architecture will remain, with possible debate over subsidies and modest administrative changes. Thus, the probability for a 'Yes' outcome\u2014major curtailment or repeal of three pillars of the ACA before 2026\u2014should be set quite low, but not absolutely zero given the risks of legislative surprises or crisis-driven political realignment.",

However, the rapidly crystallizing political and electoral risks\u2014the same ones that doomed 2017's repeal efforts\u2014now appear even starker. News articles highlight fierce Democratic resolve, deep ACA entrenchment, rising enrollment, and public preference for coverage protections, all of which historically make lawmakers risk-averse. Internal GOP divisions, especially in swing districts, further reduce appetite for bold changes that would jeopardize insurance for millions\u2014including many Republican constituents and rural hospitals. Legislative limitations of reconciliation, stakeholder pressure, and the optics of government shutdowns over health care all militate against sweeping change. The most plausible course before 2026 is a murky, incremental approach or at worst, temporary lapses in enhanced subsidies, which\u2014even with real harm\u2014do not rise to the level of repealing/curtailing three foundational ACA pillars as defined in the fine print. The bar here is major, multi-component rollback\u2014not failed negotiations, marginal program tweaks, or temporary subsidy lapses. Although tail-risk of a sharp, party-line move exists, it is heavily constrained. Base rates suggest that, since 2010, no Congress or president has managed to deliver that scale of ACA rollback.

As a health economist, I note that even potentially aggressive administrative barriers (e.g., work requirements, redetermination) are being slated for after the 2026 midterms, not before Jan 1, 2026, and are unlikely to constitute sufficient statutory change to meet the resolution bar. The history of failed Republican repeal efforts, high salience of ACA protections, and the additional political risk from a highly energized Democratic opposition make sweeping curtailment before 2026 highly improbable. The brief window to act, combined with rigid resolution criteria, pushes the likelihood even lower.

The evidence overwhelmingly shows negative feedback and policy stasis, not a high-stakes tipping point. Every historical precedent (especially 2017!) says ACA repeal is a suicide mission for swing-district Republicans, with interest groups, beneficiaries, and even rural hospitals locked in combat formation against change. The news is full of GOP leaders waving the white flag, not sharpening their spears. Your 18% optimism is doubly off: not only have there been zero credible moves to assemble a triple-pillar rollback, but even the procedural \u201cshock\u201d of the shutdown makes reps more risk-averse, not less. This is not a punctuation moment; it\u2019s status quo on steroids. You need to anchor your estimate in the reality of embedded constituencies and legislative fear, not in an abstract taste for drama.

Notably, every core argument from veto player theory, feedback theory, and interest group analysis was echoed and reinforced, even by those using different nomenclature. Direct criticism of moderate double-digit probabilities was persuasive; any probability much above 10% exaggerates the plausibility of a last-minute, broadside reconciliation success, when the concrete evidence is for stalemate, not breakthrough. The only reason to keep the probability above 5% is to acknowledge irreducible tail risk of sudden, crisis-driven legislative maneuvering.

Critiques of higher probabilities (e.g., 14-20%) are compelling: they overplay theoretical pathways and procedural hypotheticals, underestimating real-world inertia, policy constituency feedback, and political risk aversion. The baseline for dramatic, sweeping policy change is even lower than my initial estimate. The highest probabilities in the debate come from misapplied tail-risk/miracle scenario logic.

First, the most relevant base rate is 2017, where even under maximal GOP control and energy, a triple-prong curtailment failed. Since then, ACA entrenchment and interest group mobilization have only grown. Second, both expert defenses and critiques highlight that core Republican actors are openly signaling retreat ('roots too deep'), and that the remaining practical window for drastic legislative action is extremely short and politically fraught. Third, repeated emphasis from others that not only is the enhanced subsidy expiration insufficient for resolution, but that Congress is structurally and electorally incentivized to avoid major health care votes before midterms.

Notably, the best counterarguments for a higher probability depend on procedural hypotheticals (e.g., reconciliation) rather than present coalition-building or political appetite, both of which are more constrained than ever. The clearest consensus, drawing on both empirical and theoretical bases, is that dramatic policy change is undercut by electoral risk aversion, intra-GOP division, empowered ACA stakeholders, and an energized Democratic opposition. Additionally, the ticking legislative calendar further reduces feasible windows for action. There is a minimal tail risk due to potential crisis-driven dealmaking, but the probability for major ACA curtailment before 2026 is best lowered to reflect the dominant political and institutional headwinds.

A common critique was that even the low-to-mid teens are too high, as they imply a real possibility of a sudden three-pillar rollback when in reality, all evidence points to status quo maintenance or at most administrative tightening and subsidy lapse (which does not meet the resolution bar). My initial forecast erred on the side of allowing a nonzero window for a sudden procedural shift, but after reviewing the persistent stasis in policy streams, electoral risk aversion, the now 'baked-in' ACA constituencies, and the lack of legislative momentum with midterms looming, I view the odds of passage of qualifying legislation before 2026 as truly minimal.",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe[ <u>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act) (PPACA), signed into law in the US in 2010 and commonly known as the ACA (or as Obamacare), has been subject to a[ <u>number of attempts by Republicans to repeal it</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act).

More recently on the campaign trail Trump has continued to[ <u>criticize the ACA</u>](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1728511466037485668), but has somewhat softened his stance by saying \"[<u>I'm not running to terminate the ACA. . .</u>](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112163485572377413)\" and instead focusing on reforms to improve the program and cut costs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has also[ <u>recently called for reforms to the ACA</u>](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853).\n\nA number of Republican reforms to the ACA have been proposed in recent years following attempts at larger repeal, most of which have abandoned full repeal and instead aim to implement a range of reforms. Some of the published proposals are:\n\n* [<u>Proposals from chapter 14 about the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</u>](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf) from the[ <u>Project 2025 Policy Agenda</u>](https://www.project2025.org/policy/)\n* The Republican Study Committee's[ <u>FY 2025 Budget Proposal</u>](https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87)\n* A[ <u>2023 opinion piece</u>](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/4-ways-repeal-obamacare) by former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\n* A[ <u>paper from the Paragon Health Institute</u>](https://paragoninstitute.org/private-health/the-great-obamacare-enrollment-fraud/), a health policy research institute run by[ <u>Brian Blase</u>](https://paragoninstitute.org/profile/brian-blase/), former economic policy advisor during Trump's first term\n\nThe ACA is lengthy and complex, but the Republican proposals generally focus on a few key aspects, described below alongside other potential targets:\n\n* **Reducing Medicaid eligibility and expenses:** The ACA expanded federal Medicaid eligibility to households with income of 133% of the federal poverty line or less ([<u>see ACA Section 2001</u>](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ148/PLAW-111publ148.pdf), effectively this threshold is [<u>138%</u>](https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/medicaid-expansion-and-you/) after accounting for other income adjustments in the law). However, Medicaid is administered through the states with some funding supplied by the federal government. The ACA was structured to tie federal funding to this expansion, but in [*<u>NFIB v. Sebelius</u>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) the Supreme Court decided that the law amounted to an invalid coercion of states and therefore the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary. Republican proposals to change this tend to view the federal Medicaid spending as excessive and wasteful, and argue for limitations on eligibility, such as via work requirements, more flexibility for states to determine eligibility, and changes to federal funding that reduce federal spending.\n* **Limiting premium tax credits:** The ACA implemented tax credits for households with earnings from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty line to offset costs for qualified healthcare plans. Republican plans have proposed narrowing eligibility, reducing subsidy amounts, or allowing subsidies to be redirected to health savings accounts (HSAs) or insurance plans that do not comply with ACA requirements.\n* **Fully eliminating the individual mandate:** The ACA mandated that individuals must have health insurance, and imposed a penalty for those without insurance. The [<u>2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set that penalty to zero</u>](https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/individual-mandate/), effectively reducing the legal force behind the mandate. However, the mandate itself is still law, despite there being no penalty associated with it.\n* **Limiting the employer mandate:** The ACA [<u>mandated that employers of certain sizes must offer health insurance coverage to their employees</u>](https://www.cigna.com/employers/insights/informed-on-reform/employer-mandate), and imposed penalties for non-compliance. This mandate is still in effect.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on subsidies and plan eligibility:** The premium tax credits and other subsidies under the ACA are generally only eligible for healthcare plans that satisfy certain criteria set forth in the ACA. Republicans [<u>have proposed</u>](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/21/nx-s1-5198483/trump-republicans-obamacare-aca-medicaid) allowing the use of subsidies for plans that do not comply with the ACA, or for contributions to Health Savings Accounts.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on medical underwriting:** [<u>Medical underwriting</u>](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medical-underwriting.asp) is the practice of insurers determining health plan eligibility and pricing based on the health characteristics of individuals or groups. The ACA prohibited medical underwriting in most cases for health insurance with the exception of [<u>consideration</u>](https://www.healthcare.gov/how-plans-set-your-premiums/) of age, location, tobacco use, family status, and plan category. It also prohibited denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. The [<u>Republican Study Committee</u>](https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87) proposal would expand the ability of insurers to use medical underwriting, arguing that the current limitations cause younger, healthier individuals to face larger health insurance expenses.\n\nWhile Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, they could pursue significant changes through budget reconciliation, a legislative process requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation was previously used in 2017 to attempt to repeal parts of the ACA, including Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies, but the effort ultimately [<u>failed by a narrow margin</u>](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/27/539907467/senate-careens-toward-high-drama-midnight-health-care-vote). Generally only [<u>changes to law that impact certain classifications of federal spending</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation) can be accomplished with reconciliation, and [<u>typically</u>](https://www.pgpf.org/article/what-is-budget-reconciliation/) only once per year.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

The enrollment period ran from November 1 to January 31, 2017, and data from the federal website showed relatively stable enrollment through most of the year, followed by a drop-off near the end. The report covers 39 states using the federal marketplace; 11 states, including California and New York, operate their own exchanges and were not included. The Trump administration did not release nationwide enrollment figures, stating it would provide more data in March. Democrats attributed the drop to the cancellation of government outreach ads in the final week of enrollment. President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress had pledged to repeal the ACA and replace it with an undisclosed plan. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Matt Lloyd stated, \u201cWe look forward to providing relief to those who are being harmed by the status quo and pursuing patient-centered solutions that will work for the American people.\u201d However, advocates warn that uncertainty over the repeal efforts may have discouraged individuals from enrolling.

Trump stated his plan would include 'insurance for everybody,' rejecting the notion that those unable to pay should be denied care. While 'insurance for everybody' is a long-standing goal of health policy experts, government-provided insurance has lacked political support, and market-based solutions have faced challenges. Republicans had vowed to repeal the ACA for nearly seven years. The House and Senate had recently passed a budget resolution enabling the repeal of major ACA provisions without a Democratic filibuster, allowing committees in both chambers to draft the details of repeal and replacement.

Despite over a decade of rhetoric, Republicans have failed to present a coherent alternative, while the ACA has significantly reduced the uninsured rate from 45 million to 25 million, protected individuals with preexisting conditions, and expanded Medicaid and subsidies. The article notes that over 80% of ACA enrollees report satisfaction, and enrollment has reached record highs under President Biden\u2019s expanded subsidies. Crucially, ACA beneficiaries are concentrated in Republican districts, meaning red-state voters\u2014many of whom rely on ACA subsidies and Medicaid\u2014would be disproportionately harmed by GOP efforts to cut healthcare access. The article highlights that rural hospitals depend on ACA and Medicaid funding, and states like Texas, Alabama, and Missouri, which rejected Medicaid expansion, face higher uninsured rates and lower life expectancies. The GOP\u2019s refusal to govern responsibly is framed as ideological neglect disguised as freedom, with leaders like Donald Trump using fear tactics and authoritarian rhetoric to distract from policy failure. The article cites growing mobilization among disillusioned Republicans and activists, signaling a potential political realignment driven by empathy and survival. Grassroots media are called upon to counter corporate media\u2019s 'both-sides' framing and expose the human cost of Republican healthcare policy. The article concludes that the 2026 election will be a referendum on compassion, with the GOP\u2019s assault on healthcare seen as self-destructive and morally bankrupt.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[EgbertoWillies.com](https://egbertowillies.com/2025/10/29/killing-obamacare-means-killing-their-base-the-gops-2026-disaster/)\n\n**Ground Game: Republicans face voter anger over health care premiums, US and China say a trade deal is closer**\nRepublicans are facing growing voter anger over rising health care premiums, as the government shutdown enters its fourth week with no resolution in sight. The core issue is a Democratic demand to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies enacted in 2021, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have stated they will consider extending the enhanced tax credits only after Democrats agree to reopen the government. In the interim, enrollees are receiving notifications of significant premium increases for 2026. As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no coherent Republican plan emerges, the issue is gaining political momentum ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Some Republicans dispute projections that ACA premiums could more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law enables fraud and abuse. Democrats note their 2018 House flip was fueled by public backlash over the GOP\u2019s attempt to repeal Obamacare, and they anticipate a similar political outcome in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:56 PM\nSource:[AP NEWS](https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/october-27-2025)\n\n**Shutdown fight reopens debate in GOP over health care - The Boston Globe**\nDemocrats in Congress are refusing to support a government funding deal unless Republicans extend expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which would prevent premium increases and coverage losses for millions of Americans. This stance has forced Republicans to confront internal divisions: while hard-line members like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, continue to demand full repeal of the ACA, others acknowledge that doing so without a viable replacement would be politically disastrous. Former President Trump has not clearly articulated an alternative, and Republican leaders like Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have avoided detailing their health care plan, instead framing the issue as a distraction. Despite this, 14 House Republicans from competitive districts and several GOP senators support extending the credits. Johnson has admitted the ACA\u2019s 'roots are so deep' that repeal is no longer feasible. Democrats argue that Republican opposition to the credits\u2014popular across the political spectrum\u2014will backfire politically, citing a 2018 midterm election where health care was a key issue and Democrats gained 40 House seats. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi attributed the victory to Republican health care proposals that harmed vulnerable groups. Johnson\u2019s claim that Republicans are 'fixing health care' is undermined by the fact that Trump\u2019s tax law, projected to reduce premiums by only 0.6% by 2034, would also cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries countered that Republicans have attempted over 70 times to repeal the ACA without success, making them untrustworthy on the issue. A recent Senate Majority PAC poll found that voters prioritize health care over shutdown concerns by a 2-to-1 margin, giving Democrats strategic leverage. Some Democrats hope for a repeat of the 2018 midterms, where health care became a decisive political issue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:23 AM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/19/nation/shutdown-gop-health-care/)\n\n**Will Republicans Take Their Shot At Abolishing Obamacare?**\nThe article discusses the potential for Republicans to attempt to abolish the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, despite widespread public support for extending its subsidies. According to a KFF tracking poll, 78% of Americans, including 59% of Republicans, favor extending subsidies. Republicans have proposed holding a vote on extension after a government shutdown, but this is not equivalent to actually extending them. While some within the GOP prioritize political survival over healthcare policy, others remain ideologically opposed to the ACA, viewing it as a failure, and seek to dismantle its marketplaces. The article notes that the political landscape has changed since 2010 or 2017, with the Trump administration's actions removing previous constraints on GOP policy ambitions. The GOP has strengthened gerrymandering, potentially securing House control through 2026, and could use the period before the 2026 midterms to dismantle Democratic priorities. The article warns that when premium increases occur, Republicans may blame Democrats, claiming the ACA is a disaster, and could use a reconciliation bill\u2014requiring only 51 Senate votes\u2014to repeal the ACA next year, viewing it as their best and last opportunity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:39 PM\nSource:[Crooks and Liars](https://crooksandliars.com/2025/10/will-republicans-take-their-shot)\n\n**U.S. Federal Government 'Walking Toward Longest Shutdown in History,' as Healthcare Subsidies Dispute Deepens**\nThe U.S. federal government is on the brink of experiencing one of the longest shutdowns in American history, with the 13th day of the shutdown marked by President of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson stating he was unaware of the mass dismissal of federal employees by the Trump administration. The Associated Press described the dismissals as highly unusual, widely viewed as an effort to shrink government scope during the shutdown. Johnson, from Louisiana, warned, 'We are walking fast toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history.' The shutdown has halted routine government operations, closed Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions, and disrupted airport flights, adding uncertainty to an already fragile economy. The House of Representatives is not in session, with Johnson refusing to recall lawmakers to Washington, while the Senate, closed due to a federal holiday, will reconvene on Tuesday. However, senators are stalled in failed votes, as Democrats refuse to compromise on healthcare demands. Johnson thanked President Donald Trump for ensuring military personnel are paid this week, reducing a major pressure point that might have led to negotiations. The Coast Guard is also receiving pay, confirmed by a senior government official speaking anonymously. The shutdown centers on the expiration of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which affect millions relying on government assistance to afford health insurance. Democrats demand extension of subsidies, while Republicans argue the issue can be addressed later. With Congress and the White House deadlocked, the end of November is seen as a potential deadline for reopening the government, when enrollment begins for the health program and Americans face the prospect of sharply increased insurance premiums. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that monthly costs would double if subsidies are not renewed by December 31. This is also when federal employees, including thousands of House staffers, will go unpaid. The healthcare debate has persisted since the Affordable Care Act was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. The U.S. previously endured a 16-day shutdown under Obama in 2013 when Republicans sought to repeal the law. Trump attempted to repeal and replace the law in 2017, but the effort failed when Senator John McCain voted against it. With 24 million enrollees in Obamacare\u2014the highest ever\u2014Johnson said it is unlikely Republicans will pursue repeal again, citing 'post-traumatic stress' from the failed attempt. The longest previous shutdown, during Trump\u2019s first term over border wall funding, lasted 35 days and ended in 2019.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 10:35 PM\nSource:[Not\u00edcias ao Minuto](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/economia/2870336/eua-governo-federal-a-caminhar-para-paralisacao-mais-longa-da-historia)\n\n**Why Republicans&#x2019; attempts to kill Obamacare keep backfiring**\nOver the past 15 years, Republicans have attempted more than 70 times to weaken or repeal the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but these efforts have repeatedly backfired. The sweeping tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump this summer, though not officially marketed as a repeal, significantly undermined the law and is projected to remove millions of people who gained insurance under the ACA from coverage. This legislative move has become politically contentious: as a partial government shutdown enters its second week, the White House and many congressional Republicans are concerned that Democrats' demand to extend pandemic-era subsidies\u2014set to expire at the end of the year\u2014resonates strongly with voters, including Republican ones. These subsidies help low- and middle-income Americans afford health insurance on the ACA marketplaces. Republican leaders have expressed willingness to discuss extending the subsidies only after the government reopens. Democrats are betting that either Republicans will concede due to electoral risks in the upcoming midterms, or they will hold firm, allowing Democrats to leverage healthcare as a central campaign issue to regain control of the House. Millions of individuals on the individual marketplaces have already received notices indicating premium increases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 09:14 PM\nSource:[Donald J. Trump](https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4345959/posts)\n\n**How Affordable Care Act subsidies became a sticking point in the government shutdown**\nThe ongoing federal government shutdown, now in its tenth day, has been prolonged in part due to a dispute over the expiration of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which are set to end on December 31, 2025. These premium tax credits, initially expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase financial assistance and broaden eligibility, help millions of Americans afford health insurance through the marketplace. Democrats argue that failing to extend the subsidies before the November 1 open enrollment period could lead to dramatic premium increases\u2014estimates from the Congressional Budget Office project a 4.3% rise in 2026 and 7.7% in 2027, while a KFF analysis predicts an average 114% increase, from $888 to $1,904 per year. A KFF poll found 78% of Americans, including over half of Republicans and 'Make America Great Again' supporters, support extending the enhanced credits. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warned that without extension, tens of millions would face thousands of dollars in higher premiums, co-pays, and deductibles annually. Experts like Melinda Buntin of Johns Hopkins and Naomi Zewde of UCLA emphasize that low-income working families, particularly in non-Medicaid expansion states, would be disproportionately affected. Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue the issue is distant and prefer a 'clean' continuing resolution to reopen the government without addressing subsidies, promising future discussions. However, Democrats refuse to support a clean bill without health care negotiations, creating a deadlock. President Donald Trump claimed to be negotiating with Democrats on health care, even expressing openness to a deal, but later reversed course, insisting the government must reopen first. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denied any White House negotiations. Legal expert James Blumstein suggests a retroactive fix is possible, and that the issue may resurface in five to six weeks when leverage shifts. The Department of Health and Human Services blamed Senate Democrats for the shutdown, stating they are blocking government reopening and endangering health programs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-subsidies-sticking-point-government-shutdown/story?id=126322841)\n\n**Obamacare in the spotlight as US govt shutdown deepens**\nThe U.S. government shutdown entered its third day on October 3, 2025, with no resolution in sight, as Congress remains deadlocked over funding and the future of enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare. The dispute centers on whether to extend ACA subsidies\u2014expanded during the pandemic and set to expire at the end of 2025\u2014before reopening federal operations. Democrats insist that any funding bill must include an extension of these subsidies, which currently help over 22 million Americans afford health insurance, with the Kaiser Family Foundation projecting that average out-of-pocket premiums could more than double\u2014from $888 to $1,904\u2014without them. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 4.2 million people could lose coverage if the subsidies lapse. Republicans oppose linking funding to subsidies, arguing they cost an estimated $350 billion through 2034 and distort insurance markets, demanding broader fiscal reforms first. President Donald Trump has amplified the divide by falsely claiming Democrats seek over $1 trillion in healthcare funding for undocumented immigrants, despite non-citizens being ineligible for ACA coverage. Democrats have instead proposed restoring eligibility for certain legal immigrants, whose access was restricted by a Trump-backed tax law, potentially leaving 1.4 million lawfully present immigrants without insurance. Public opinion, per a Washington Post flash poll, shows nearly half of Americans blame Republicans and Trump for the shutdown, with independents more than twice as likely to fault the GOP. While some Senate Republicans have floated compromise ideas\u2014such as a one-year extension with phased reductions\u2014House conservatives remain resistant. The timing is critical: open enrollment for health insurance begins in November, and insurers must set 2026 rates without clarity on subsidy extensions. Rural and older populations, often in Republican-leaning areas, could be disproportionately affected. Despite signs of potential compromise, including support from vulnerable House members and Senate Republicans drafting guardrails, a deal remains unlikely until the immediate funding issue is resolved. The standoff underscores a deeper national debate over the federal government\u2019s role in ensuring affordable healthcare.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:39 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/world/obamacare-barack-obama-donald-trump-republicans-democrats-affordable-care-act-united-states-of-america-13938879.html)\n\n**House advances stopgap bill to avert government shutdown**\nThe Republican\u2011controlled House cleared a vote for a stopgap funding measure that would keep federal agencies funded through Nov.\u202f21, giving lawmakers time to agree on full appropriations for fiscal year\u202f2026, which starts Oct.\u202f1. The measure, a continuing resolution (CR), was approved by a 216\u2011210 vote and includes $88\u202fmillion for security for members of Congress, the Supreme Court and the executive branch after the killing of activist Charlie\u202fKirk. House Republicans plan to pass the CR by Friday and send it to the Senate, where it also needs approval before President Donald\u202fTrump can sign it. The White House issued a policy statement backing the CR, while Democrats have called it a partisan Republican bill. On the same day, Democrats unveiled a competing proposal that would keep the government open through Oct.\u202f31, restore Medicaid funding eliminated by Trump\u2019s tax\u2011cut bill, and permanently extend health\u2011care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. Senate Democratic leader Chuck\u202fSchumer said the two\u2011week window could allow a bipartisan compromise, saying, 'We have two weeks. They should sit down and talk to us, and we maybe can get a good proposal. Let's see.' Senate Majority Leader John\u202fThune warned, 'I don't think Democrats are going to get very far with this one.' The annual funding debate covers only about one\u2011quarter of the federal government\u2019s $7\u202ftrillion budget, which also includes mandatory programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and payments on the nation\u2019s $37.5\u202ftrillion debt.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 02:37 AM\nSource:[KSL.com](https://www.ksl.com/article/51376757/house-advances-stopgap-bill-to-avert-government-shutdown)\n\n**'Obamacare' hits record enrollment but an uncertain future awaits under Trump**\nEnrollment in the government health care marketplace under the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as 'Obamacare') has reached a record high, according to updated data from January 8, 2025. President Joe Biden credited the surge to his administration\u2019s efforts to lower health care and prescription drug costs, simplify enrollment, and strengthen the ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid. The increase is attributed to expanded tax credits, which have made coverage more affordable for millions. However, these tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress enacts new legislation. Incoming President-elect Donald Trump, who previously sought to dismantle the ACA during his first term and has criticized it as 'costly' and offering 'lousy' coverage, has not presented a detailed replacement plan. During his first term, enrollment declined due to reduced funding and fewer navigator resources. A coalition of major health care entities, including top insurers, health systems, and medical associations, has formed the 'Keep Americans Covered' campaign to lobby Congress to extend the tax credits. Despite political opposition from some Republicans who previously voted to repeal the ACA, there is growing pressure to maintain coverage, especially as open enrollment on HealthCare.gov ends on January 15, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 10:02 AM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/obamacare-aca-health-care-coverage-biden-trump-0c73dcde4a19aea65cb83de01f2d5d2e)\n\n**Fewer People Signed Up For Affordable Care Act Coverage In 2017 - The Cerbat Gem**\nEnrollment in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) declined in 2017 compared to 2016, with approximately 376,000 people signing up in the final two weeks of the enrollment period, down from nearly 700,000 in the same period the previous year. The enrollment period ran from November 1 to January 31, 2017, and data from the federal website showed relatively stable enrollment through most of the year, followed by a drop-off near the end. The report covers 39 states using the federal marketplace; 11 states, including California and New York, operate their own exchanges and were not included. The Trump administration did not release nationwide enrollment figures, stating it would provide more data in March. Democrats attributed the drop to the cancellation of government outreach ads in the final week of enrollment. President Donald Trump and the GOP-led Congress had pledged to repeal the ACA and replace it with an undisclosed plan. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Matt Lloyd stated, \u201cWe look forward to providing relief to those who are being harmed by the status quo and pursuing patient-centered solutions that will work for the American people.\u201d However, advocates warn that uncertainty over the repeal efforts may have discouraged individuals from enrolling. The administration faces challenges in fulfilling repeal promises without disrupting coverage for millions of Americans.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2017 01:18 PM\nSource:[thecerbatgem.com](https://www.thecerbatgem.com/2017/02/03/fewer-people-signed-up-for-affordable-care-act-coverage-in-2017.html)\n\n**President-Elect\u2019s Plan For Health Insurance Light On Details - The Cerbat Gem**\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump announced he is nearing completion of a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), with the full details expected to be unveiled after the Senate confirms Representative Tom Price of Georgia as Secretary of Health and Human Services. Price is scheduled to testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, though his Senate Finance Committee hearing has not yet been scheduled. Trump stated his plan would ensure 'insurance for everybody,' rejecting the notion that people who cannot afford care should be denied it. While 'insurance for everybody' has long been a goal of health policy experts, government-provided health insurance has lacked broad political support, and market-based alternatives have faced implementation challenges. Republicans have vowed to repeal the ACA for nearly seven years. Last week, Trump called for Congress to repeal the ACA and replace it 'very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.' The House and Senate have begun the repeal process by passing a budget resolution that enables repeal without a Democratic filibuster. Committees in both chambers are now tasked with developing the specifics of repealing and replacing the law.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2017 06:59 PM\nSource:[thecerbatgem.com](https://www.thecerbatgem.com/2017/01/16/president-elects-plan-for-health-insurance-light-on-details.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that a major repeal or curtailment of at least three major components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) before January 1, 2026 is highly unlikely, with probability estimates uniformly clustered in the low range (5%\u201320%). Forecasters from health policy analysis, legislative affairs, political science, and economics perspectives agree that, despite unified Republican control of the federal government and access to budget reconciliation (which permits certain fiscal changes by simple majority), key historical, procedural, and political obstacles substantially reduce the likelihood of achieving the level of ACA curtailment required for a 'Yes' resolution under the question's strict criteria. \n\nMajor factors identified as decreasing the probability include: the historical resilience and increasing popularity of the ACA (including among Republican voters), positive policy feedback and interest group mobilization from hospitals, insurers, and advocacy groups, strong and unified Democratic opposition following recent electoral gains, and pervasive internal GOP divisions\u2014particularly from moderates and vulnerable members wary of electoral backlash ahead of 2026 midterms. High-profile failures of past repeal efforts (notably the 2017 attempt), the absence of a clear GOP replacement proposal, and the technical limits of reconciliation (which may not reach all six targeted components) are repeatedly cited as structural impediments.\n\nSeveral experts note that expiration of enhanced subsidies, scheduled at the end of 2025, by itself does not meet the criteria for major ACA curtailment, with the fine print explicitly requiring statutory (not just administrative or temporary) repeal or restriction across three of six defined pillars. Public opinion, recent voting trends, and interest group campaigns make legislators risk-averse, compounding legislative inertia.\n\nWhile a very small chance remains of a last-minute, crisis-driven reconciliation package targeting Medicaid, premium tax credits, and possibly employer or underwriting mandates (cited as a theoretical 'Yes' scenario), all forecasters emphasize that this would require an abrupt and highly unlikely shift in party discipline, legislative risk-taking, and procedural timing. Most probable is some administrative tightening, expiration of enhanced subsidies, or modest incremental changes, not broad multi-component repeal.\n\nIn summary: Experts strongly favor a 'No' resolution, seeing the window for sweeping ACA rollback as effectively closed by political, legislative, and stakeholder dynamics, with only a slim\u2014though not zero\u2014tail risk of a dramatic late change before the deadline.",
