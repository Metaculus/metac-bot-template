Critiques further reinforce that, barring an outlier catastrophe, base rates of post-settlement pay reversals are negligible in this scenario.

Defense of very low probabilities (sub-15%) was sharply argued, and my own critique of those forecasting above 30% reinforced that anything above single digits or low teens reflects ignoring the unique and hostile context BMA now faces.

Notably, those who estimate higher probabilities are consistently critiqued as overweighting historical base rates and undervaluing the decisive shift in the political, fiscal, and public-opinion context since the last concession cycles.

The strike entered its tenth day on November 10, 2025, and stems from years of unmet demands, including unpaid arrears from salary adjustments, hazard and accoutrements allowances, delayed promotions, and poor working conditions. Suleiman criticized the government's claim that N41.3 billion was released to cover 25\u201335% arrears, stating that fewer than 60% of NARD members received payment alerts and that alerts have since ceased. He also noted that an additional N2.9 billion, promised for other allowances, had not been released as scheduled. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare had previously claimed it approved N11.995 billion in payments within 72 hours and disbursed N10 billion in August for arrears and N10.6 billion for the 2025 Medical Residency Training Fund, while announcing recruitment waivers to address staff shortages. However, NARD insists these announcements do not reflect reality, as most members have not received payments. Reports from major hospitals in Lagos, Abuja, and Kaduna revealed severely reduced services, with many wards closed, outpatient units suspended, and only emergency and antenatal units operational. Suleiman emphasized that the strike is not only about financial demands but also about dignity, respect for agreements, safety, and survival. He reiterated that the strike will continue until the government demonstrates sincerity through tangible actions, stating, 'Until we agree on these issues and actions are taken, the industrial action will continue.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 11:43 AM\nSource:[Premium Times Nigeria](https://www.premiumtimesng.com/health/health-news/834270-resident-doctors-say-strike-will-continue-until-government-takes-action.html)\n\n**Doctors branded 'farcical' for voting against improvements to GP appointments**\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) was criticized as a 'farce' by Care Minister Stephen Kinnock after its members voted against the government's proposed online GP appointment system, which aims to allow patients to book appointments from 8am to 6:30pm Monday to Friday. Kinnock accused the BMA of obstructing vital patient care improvements and endangering safety ahead of winter. The BMA's motion argued that the online access mandates would reduce care to 'box-ticking targets,' were inadequately funded, and could lead to missed urgent patient requests. The union's GP committee for England was instructed to prepare options for action, including strikes or non-compliance. Dr Tom Dolphin, BMA council chairman, warned that unfulfillable promises about online access could push GP practices to the brink, reduce available appointments, and risk missing urgent cases. The dispute reflects deteriorating relations between Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the BMA.

The strike is ongoing in approximately 91 health institutions across Nigeria. Key demands include the implementation of the Consolidated Medical Salary Structure (CONMESS), release of the 2025 Medical Residency Training Fund (MRTF) with inflation adjustments, health insurance for all medical and dental professionals, clearance of outstanding salary arrears, pension benefits, corrected allowances, specialist allowances, full entitlement for house officers, reinstatement of five resident doctors unjustly terminated at the Federal Teaching Hospital in Lokoja, end to casualisation, promotion scales, reversal of non-medical personnel appointments as honorary consultants, and the immediate establishment of health management boards. The article emphasizes that the strike, now over a week old, is causing casualties and threatens progress in Nigeria\u2019s health sector. It warns of significant economic losses and the risk of reversing gains made by the government. The Nation Newspaper stresses that healthcare workers are vital national assets and that Nigeria\u2019s severe doctor-to-patient ratio\u2014below UN benchmarks\u2014undermines public health and life expectancy. While acknowledging the government\u2019s challenges, the article criticizes the disparity between public officials\u2019 generous welfare packages and doctors\u2019 unpaid salaries and allowances, including five-year-old COVID-19 allowances. It urges the Federal Government to immediately reopen negotiations with NARD, prioritize non-monetary issues to ease working conditions, and implement realistic, long-term policies. The paper also calls on NARD to uphold its Hippocratic Oath and show compassion, as the public suffers when professionals are caught in disputes.

Health Secretary Wes Streeting supported hospital managers, saying they have 'your backs' if they must spread staff thinly\u2014despite BMA concerns over safety. The BMA's Melissa Ryan stated the union wants to avoid prolonged strikes but demands concrete action, not just words.

He reiterated that further pay increases are unaffordable. Dr Jack Fletcher, BMA\u2019s resident doctors committee chairman, countered that the offer does not solve the jobs crisis and accused Streeting of refusing a multi-year pay deal to restore historical pay freezes. The BMA warned that strikes from November 14 to 19 remain possible unless the Government demonstrates genuine willingness to negotiate a fair, long-term solution.

The BMA's Resident Doctors Committee declared the offer 'does not go far enough.' The dispute has intensified, with the BMA accusing Streeting of 'holding doctors' jobs hostage' after he warned that further strikes could jeopardize funding for training expansions. Streeting reiterated in his offer that he would 'not be able to afford to offer the non-pay package again' and 'may also have to reconsider whether the NHS can afford the other elements we have committed to' if strikes continue.

The government, citing financial pressures, stated it cannot increase pay further, emphasizing that 'no amount of strike action will change this.' The proposed offer included speciality training and coverage for exam and membership fees, but doctors argue it 'does not go far enough.' According to the BMA, as of August 2025, 34% of resident doctors reported not having regular or substantial employment, with 10,000 job openings available for 30,000 candidates, including international applicants. Dr. Jack Fletcher of the BMA stated that '1,000 more [jobs] is not going to fix this crisis' and criticized Health Secretary Wes Streeting for failing to address the severity of the situation, noting that doctors face unemployment while patients face long wait times. Resident doctors earn a basic salary of \u00a338,831 annually, equating to approximately \u00a32,600 per month after tax. The strike follows previous walkouts in July 2025, and while senior doctors are being deployed to mitigate disruptions, the action is expected to severely impact access to emergency and routine care. Dr. Fletcher emphasized that strikes could be avoided if the government offers a multi-year pay deal and a genuine solution on job creation, warning that the current stance risks a real-terms pay cut.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 08:18 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/nhs-workers-strike-vote-yes-104632498.html)\n\n**Resident doctors set to strike for five days over pay and job dispute**\nResident doctors in England, represented by the British Medical Association (BMA), have rejected a government pay and job offer, leading to a planned five-day strike from 7 a.m. on 14 November to 7 a.m. on 19 November 2025. The government's package, presented by Health Secretary Wes Streeting, included additional specialty training places and coverage of mandatory exam and membership fees, but excluded any pay increases. Streeting stated that financial constraints prevent further pay concessions, asserting that 'no amount of strike action will change this' and warning that the offer was 'not going to change' the situation. Dr Jack Fletcher, BMA's Resident Doctors Committee chairman, criticized the offer as insufficient, noting that 30,000 doctors applied for only 10,000 training places in the current year, and that adding 1,000 more spots would not resolve the systemic job crisis. He emphasized that a multi-year pay deal restoring pay over time could prevent strikes, but the government remains unwilling to commit. Streeting called the rejection a 'missed opportunity' and reaffirmed his commitment to minimizing patient impact, urging NHS staff to keep services running and assuring patients that disruptions will be mitigated.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 11:29 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/resident-doctors-set-strike-five-231902188.html)\n\n**Resident doctors set to strike next week after rejecting Government...**\nResident doctors in England, represented by the British Medical Association (BMA), have rejected a new government offer aimed at ending a prolonged dispute over jobs and pay, stating it 'does not go far enough.'

Health Secretary Wes Streeting reiterated that pay increases are not possible due to 'enormous financial pressures,' and stated that no amount of strike action will change this. He described the rejection as a 'missed opportunity' and stressed that the NHS leadership must now focus on minimizing patient disruption. Dr. Fletcher urged the government to offer a multi-year pay deal to avoid strikes, noting that the current offer includes a suggestion of a real-terms pay cut.

The demands, jointly signed by NARD President Muhammad Suleiman, Secretary-General Dr. Shuaibu Ibrahim, and Publicity and Social Secretary Abdulmajid Ibrahim, address long-standing issues including the settlement of unpaid arrears (25/35% Consolidated Medical Salary Structure review, accoutrement allowance, promotion and upgrade arrears, and salary arrears), correction of irregularities in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System, and the prompt implementation of delayed promotions. Despite the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare's claim that over \u20a630 billion has been released to offset arrears, NARD emphasized that many resident doctors have not received full payments. The association highlighted a decline in Nigeria\u2019s resident doctor pool from 15,000\u201316,000 a decade ago to 9,000\u201310,000 today, driven by poor remuneration, unsafe work conditions, and delayed payments, fueling the 'Japa syndrome' (migration abroad). NARD criticized the government for delays in reinstating dismissed doctors from the Federal Teaching Hospital, Lokoja, and called for correction of the Medical and Dental Council of Nigeria\u2019s (MDCN) re-categorisation of certificates, which demoralized doctors. It also demanded inclusion of resident doctors providing specialist-level services in the specialist allowance, an urgent review of the professional allowance table to align with inflation and the minimum wage, and resolution of unpaid salaries, non-implementation of the one-for-one replacement policy, and casualisation of doctors. NARD stressed that the strike is not against the public but for the dignity, safety, and survival of healthcare workers and patients, and called for verifiable actions, not promises, to restore industrial peace and a functional healthcare system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/our-19-demands-reasonable-say-striking-resident-doctors/)\n\n**The doctor will out-earn you now! A third of GP partners earn more than the Prime Minister, Wes Streeting reveals | Daily Mail Online**\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting has challenged the British Medical Association's (BMA) claim that general practitioners (GPs) lack the funds or capacity to implement online booking for non-urgent appointments, calling the stance 'baffling' and 'absurd'. According to Department of Health data based on NHS England Digital research and HMRC self-assessment records, a third of GP partners in England earned over \u00a3175,000 in 2023-24\u2014exceeding Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s gross annual salary of \u00a3172,153. One in six GP partners earned more than \u00a3225,000, and the top 10% earned over \u00a3256,400. GP earnings have risen by \u00a337,000 over the past decade and \u00a318,500 in the last year alone. Streeting confirmed a backdated 4% pay award for GPs and other medical staff in May. The government emphasized it has invested an extra \u00a31.1 billion in general practice and recruited 2,500 additional GPs to support modernization. The BMA, however, continues to oppose mandatory online booking, citing resource constraints. Meanwhile, Nicola Ranger of the Royal College of Nursing criticized the government\u2019s proposed 2.5% pay rise as 'derisory', warning it fails to cover living costs and risks further staff shortages. The government cautioned that any pay increase above 2.5% could lead to \u00a3750 million in additional costs per 0.5 percentage point, potentially forcing service and staffing cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15250927/doctor-GP-partners-earn-Prime-Minister-Wes-Streeting.html)\n\n**Hospitals will be 'as bad as during the pandemic' this winter, warns NHS boss - Daily Star**\nJim Mackey, chief executive of NHS England, warned that hospitals could face a crisis this winter comparable to the pandemic due to a surge in flu cases and a planned doctors' strike. Flu cases are currently three times higher than usual for this time of year, and A&E departments are expected to see record demand. Mackey stated that the combination of increased patient footfall and staff shortages from the British Medical Association's (BMA) strike\u2014scheduled from November 14\u201319 over pay and job concerns\u2014could lead to conditions resembling those during the pandemic. The BMA rejected the government\u2019s proposed 2.5% pay rise for 2026 as 'indefensible,' citing over a decade of pay erosion and rising workloads. BMA council chairman Dr Tom Dolphin called the offer a 'profound disregard' for doctors. Unison\u2019s health head Helga Pile described the raise as an 'insult' and 'way-below-inflation,' predicting widespread dissatisfaction. A separate report by Age UK found that one in three patients over 90 now waits at least 12 hours in A&E, with some dying in hospital corridors. Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged the NHS\u2019s recurring winter crisis and emphasized that this government is planning earlier than in previous years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 03:03 PM\nSource:[Daily Star](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/hospitals-as-bad-during-pandemic-36170069)\n\n**Resident doctors announce five-day strike as government talks collapse**\nResident doctors across England will conduct a five-day strike from 14 to 18 November 2025 after pay negotiations with the UK government collapsed. The British Medical Association (BMA) cited years of below-inflation pay increases and rising workloads, stating that many doctors are 'at breaking point.' The strike follows a failed attempt to reach a multi-year pay deal, with the BMA urging Health Secretary Wes Streeting to return to talks. Jack Fletcher, chair of the Resident Doctor Committee, emphasized that the proposed deal included a \u00a31 hourly pay increase over four years to reverse cumulative pay erosion, which has reached 21% since 2008. A BMA survey of 4,401 doctors found that 34% were unable to secure substantive employment or regular locum positions by August 2026. Although the government pledged 1,000 additional specialty training places, doctors argue this is insufficient. Fletcher stressed that a comprehensive plan including pay restoration and job creation is essential to stabilize the NHS and prevent further industrial action, calling on Streeting to 'step up' and deliver a credible offer to make the NHS 'fit for doctors and fit for patients.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[Open Access Government](https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/resident-doctors-announce-five-day-strike-as-government-talks-collapse/200424/)\n\n**Resident Doctors' Strike Threatens to Shut Down UK Hospitals for 5 Days**\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) announced that thousands of resident doctors, formerly known as junior doctors, will strike for five days from November 14 to 19, 2025, aiming to disrupt hospital operations. This marks the 13th strike since 2022, following the government's failure to offer a 'satisfactory' pay deal. Previous strikes have already led to the cancellation of approximately 1.5 million medical appointments. The BMA argues that the government's proposed 5.4% pay increase in May\u2014based on an independent body's recommendation\u2014is insufficient to offset a 21% real-terms pay erosion since 2008, and demands a 29.2% increase to restore pay value. Dr. Jack Fletcher, chair of the BMA\u2019s junior doctors committee, stated that half of second-year residents face difficulties finding jobs, wasting their skills while patients await care. The strike follows failed negotiations, during which the government rejected proposals for phased pay increases and new job creation. Health Secretary Wes Streeting labeled the strike 'excessive and unnecessary,' warning it 'hinders the recovery of the National Health Service (NHS).' He claimed doctors have already received a 28.9% increase and that the government cannot afford further raises this year, accusing the BMA of rejecting proposals to improve working conditions and expand specialist training opportunities. The BMA maintains that the strike is justified due to the real-terms pay decline, citing the Retail Price Index (RPI), while the government relies on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which shows only a 5% decline since 2008. A YouGov poll revealed 48% of Britons oppose the strike, compared to 39% in support\u2014a shift from last summer\u2019s majority support (52%).

Health Secretary Wes Streeting condemned the strike as 'preposterous,' accusing the BMA of rejecting a government offer to improve working conditions and create additional specialty training roles. He criticized the BMA for pursuing further strike action just one week after its new leadership began discussions with the government, stating they were 'walking away from an offer' aimed at addressing key concerns.

The strike follows ongoing disputes over pay and employment prospects, with the BMA stating that half of second-year doctors in England are struggling to find jobs, leading to wasted skills and unfilled hospital shifts. Dr. Jack Fletcher, chair of the BMA's resident doctors committee, said the government\u2019s '11th hour letter' offered vague promises for changes to jobs and training two years in the future, showing 'little understanding of the crisis here and now.' He emphasized that better employment prospects and pay restoration are 'a credible way forward' for doctors, the government, and patients. The BMA has argued that real-terms pay has fallen by approximately 20% since 2008 and is demanding full 'pay restoration.' This strike marks the second walkout in 2025, following a five-day strike in July. Health Secretary Wes Streeting condemned the action as 'reckless' and 'irresponsible,' accusing the BMA of attempting to 'hold the country to ransom.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 01:49 PM\nSource:[ITV Hub](https://www.itv.com/news/2025-10-23/resident-doctors-announce-strike-action-in-england)\n\n**How Resident Doctor Strike Exposed a Generational Rift Within The Profession**\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) announced a five-day walkout by resident doctors, which led to a public outcry. Health Secretary Wes Streeting accused the BMA of 'holding the country to ransom' and argued that the strikes would 'throttle' NHS progress on waiting lists. However, the BMA claims that the 22% pay rise awarded between 2023-2024 was not enough to restore pay to 2008 levels, and that doctors have suffered a pay erosion of 21% in real terms since 2008. The BMA's deputy chair, Dr Emma Runswick, stated that the 28.9% pay rise over the last three years only amounts to an 8% increase in real terms when taking inflation into account. The strikes have exposed a generational rift among doctors, with some arguing that resident doctors are 'entitled' and 'unconscionable', while others point out that medics today have it much harder than their predecessors. The BMA has revealed that 52% of FY2 doctors surveyed had 'no substantive employment' or locum work from August 2025, and that some doctors are living on Job Seeker's allowance or being forced to move to New Zealand. The situation is attributed to a training bottleneck, with not enough specialty training posts to match the number of doctors qualifying. The Government has committed to expanding the workforce, but the execution has been short-sighted. The BMA holds a legal mandate that allows strikes to carry on until January 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 04, 2025 07:49 AM\nSource:[Byline Times](https://bylinetimes.com/2025/08/04/bma-doctor-strike/)\n\n**'No one wants to be on strike but what I do want is to not be paid less than doctors were in 2008' - Manchester Evening News**\nA five-day walkout by resident doctors in England began today, with members of the British Medical Association manning picket lines across the country. The BMA is pushing for full 'pay restoration' after real-terms pay has fallen by around 20% since 2008. Ross Nieuwoudt, co-chair of the BMA resident doctors committee, said, 'No one wants to be on strike - I don't want to - but what I do want is to feel valued and respected and not paid less than doctors were in 2008.' He added that morale among doctors is mixed, but many are leaving the country due to low pay and poor conditions. Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said, 'This government is doing all it can over this strike period to minimise patient harm and disruption.' However, the BMA argues that the government has not made a credible offer to restore pay, and the strike will continue until a satisfactory solution is reached.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 06:38 PM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/no-one-wants-strike-what-32137683)\n\n**50,000 British Doctors Go on 5-Day Strike Demanding 29% Pay Increase**\nApproximately 50,000 doctors in England have begun a 5-day strike, from 7am on Friday to 7am on Wednesday, July 30, after negotiations between the British government and the British Medical Association (BMA) representing the resident doctors (previously known as junior doctors) failed. The doctors are demanding a 29% pay increase to compensate for a 20% real-terms pay cut since 2008. Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the strike as 'unreasonable' and 'harmful to patients and efforts to reform the National Health Service.' The resident doctors, who make up about half of the doctors in Britain, are a crucial part of the healthcare system, working in various hospital departments, including emergency and general practitioner practices. They undergo a long training period of up to 10 years, facing challenges such as expensive training exam fees (up to thousands of pounds) and student debt of up to \u00a3100,000. Before the strike, Health Secretary Wes Streeting held extensive talks with the BMA, focusing on improving working conditions, such as covering exam fees, giving doctors more control over their schedules, and speeding up career progression. However, the BMA rejected a postponement of the strike, considering the government's offer 'lacking in credibility' to restore pay. A survey by the 'Ipsos' institute showed a decline in public support for the strike from 52% last year to 26%, increasing pressure on both sides to reach a solution. Health officials warn that the strike will lead to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of patient appointments, threatening efforts to reduce waiting lists in the National Health Service, which serves around 300,000 appointments daily.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 04:48 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0639\u0643\u0627\u0638](https://www.okaz.com.sa/variety/na/2206046)\n\n**NHS England toughens stance on resident doctors\u2019 strike**\nNHS England, under Chief Executive Sir Jim Mackey, has adopted a tougher stance toward resident doctors' strike actions, stating it will be 'much more resistant' to pay demands than in the past. Mackey warned that strikes should no longer be 'consequence-free,' citing that previous industrial actions from July 2023 to February 2024 led to over 500,000 appointments and operations being cancelled, with doctors benefiting financially through overtime. He instructed hospital leaders to continue scheduled operations to avoid future overtime costs and emphasized that safety decisions rest with NHS leaders, not the British Medical Association (BMA). Health Secretary Wes Streeting supported hospital managers, saying they have 'your backs' if they must spread staff thinly\u2014despite BMA concerns over safety. The BMA's Melissa Ryan stated the union wants to avoid prolonged strikes but demands concrete action, not just words. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges warned that patient safety is at risk due to uncertainty over doctor absences and urged the BMA to suspend its guidance that doctors need not inform employers of strike intentions. The BMA has accepted a 22.3% pay settlement but still plans to return to strike action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 24, 2025 11:19 AM\nSource:[personneltoday.com](https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/nhs-england-stance-resident-doctors-strike/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a range of expert perspectives\u2014labour relations, public sector policy, political science, economics, and sociology\u2014the consensus forecast is that it is unlikely resident (junior) doctors in England will receive a further pay increase beyond the already enacted 5.4% for 2025\u201326 before January 1, 2026. Most experts highlight several converging factors decreasing the probability: the newly elected Labour government\u2019s explicit and repeated stance that no further increases are affordable, tight fiscal constraints, declining public support for strikes (recent polls show more opposition than support), and historical precedent indicating late-year, post-settlement pay increases are rare. While most experts acknowledge that continued or escalating industrial action, especially if coinciding with a catastrophic winter crisis in the NHS, could theoretically force a last-minute government U-turn and a further pay rise, they generally see this as a low-probability (tail risk) scenario that would require an extraordinary exogenous shock or operational collapse. A few forecasters, especially those drawing on Economics (Labour Market) and Political Science (Interest Group Theory), give higher probabilities (up to 35% and 27%, respectively), arguing that workforce pressures, skill shortages, and the BMA\u2019s strong collective action potential keep a non-negligible risk alive. However, most others (including Labour Relations and Public Policy experts) provide very low forecasts (5\u201314%) pointing to hardened government resolve, the marginal effect of additional strikes, and procedural/administrative barriers to implementing an uplift before the year\u2019s end. Mean probabilities center in the low teens, with none exceeding 35%. The group chat also stresses that unless an increase is not just offered but actually enacted before the deadline, the resolution remains No. In summary, the expert consensus is that a further pay increase for resident doctors before 2026 is unlikely, barring a dramatic and unforeseen NHS crisis.",
