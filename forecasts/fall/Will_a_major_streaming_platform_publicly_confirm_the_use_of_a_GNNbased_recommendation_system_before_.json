N-BEATS aims to combine the strengths of traditional statistical models (like ARIMA) and deep learning models (like RNNs), offering high accuracy and interpretability without requiring domain-specific adjustments. The model uses a stack-and-block architecture: multiple stacks process the input data iteratively, with each stack containing several blocks. Each block is a four-layer fully connected neural network that generates both a forecast and a backcast. The backcast helps refine the model\u2019s understanding of the input data, while the forecast predicts future values. The model processes data through successive stacks, progressively improving predictions. The article demonstrates how to implement N-BEATS in Python using the neuralforecast library, applying it to daily closing prices of NAS100 and US500 from MetaTrader 5. The model was trained with a horizon of 30 days, an input size of 90 days, and 100 maximum training steps.

The proposed 1D-CNN architecture consists of five convolutional layers, seven batch normalization layers, three dropout layers, and three dense layers. It achieves 96.79% accuracy, 97.91% sensitivity, 92.79% specificity, and 97.88% precision\u2014outperforming prior methods\u2014while requiring only 20 AECG signals for training, a significant reduction compared to existing approaches that typically demand larger datasets. The model eliminates the need for maternal ECG (MECG) component extraction, reducing computational complexity and signal decomposition artifacts. A key innovation is a 100-millisecond resolution labeling strategy with data augmentation via overlapping 1-second windows, enabling high-precision detection with minimal preprocessing. The study demonstrates that the model performs robustly even under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and is suitable for real-time, low-resource clinical deployment. Compared to complex hybrid architectures (e.g., CNN-LSTM, RCED-Net, dual-attention models), the proposed method offers superior computational efficiency, lower memory usage, and greater practicality for portable fetal monitoring systems. The results are benchmarked against previous studies, including those using private datasets and advanced preprocessing, confirming the model\u2019s strong performance with minimal data and processing. The research underscores the potential of 1D-CNNs in scalable, efficient fetal cardiac monitoring across diverse clinical settings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22999-9)\n\n**Peering inside the black box by learning the relevance of many-body functions in neural network potentials**\nThis article presents a study on interpreting neural network potentials (NNPs) in coarse-grained (CG) molecular systems using a method called Graph Neural Network Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (GNN-LRP). The research focuses on enhancing trust in NNPs by demonstrating the physical plausibility of learned interactions. In two case studies\u2014bulk methane (CH\u2084) and water (H\u2082O)\u2014GNN-LRP reveals that both PaiNN and SO3Net GNN architectures produce consistent 2-body and 3-body relevance contributions, indicating they learn the same underlying energy landscape. For methane, 3-body interactions are negligible, while for water, significant 3-body contributions align with known hydrogen bonding behavior, including stabilizing effects at ~50\u201360\u00b0 angles and destabilizing corrections to overstructured 2-body terms. GNN-LRP further uncovers model artifacts: a PaiNN model for methane shows rare stabilizing 3-body contributions at short distances, which are absent in training data, suggesting a potential overfitting issue not detectable via standard MD simulations. In a second example, the method is applied to the protein NTL9 (PDB ID: 2HBA), where GNN-LRP identifies stabilizing 2-body interactions in \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helices, including a destabilizing VAL3-GLU38 interaction consistent with known repulsive side-chain interactions. The method also distinguishes two folding pathways (P1 and P2) by analyzing relevance differences in intermediate states, showing that P1 retains native-like \u03b2-sheets but with reduced stability, while P2 forms only the \u03b2-sheet. Mutations (ILE4ASN and LEU30PHE) are simulated, and relevance changes confirm that the model captures hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions and non-local packing effects. Overall, GNN-LRP enables interpretable, physically meaningful insights into NNPs, validating their reliability and exposing hidden deficiencies beyond traditional performance metrics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65863-0)\n\n**From Real to Complex: Exploring \"Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Deep Learning\"**\nComplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are an emerging advancement in deep learning that operate on complex numbers\u2014numbers with both real and imaginary components (a + bi, where i = \u221a-1)\u2014to better model data with inherent magnitude and phase information, such as signals, waves, and quantum states.

The proposed 1D-CNN architecture consists of five convolutional layers, seven batch normalization layers, three dropout layers, and three dense layers. It achieves 96.79% accuracy, 97.91% sensitivity, 92.79% specificity, and 97.88% precision\u2014outperforming prior methods\u2014while requiring only 20 AECG signals for training, a significant reduction compared to existing approaches that typically demand larger datasets. The model eliminates the need for maternal ECG (MECG) component extraction, reducing computational complexity and signal decomposition artifacts. A key innovation is a 100-millisecond resolution labeling strategy with data augmentation via overlapping 1-second windows, enabling high-precision detection with minimal preprocessing. The study demonstrates that the model performs robustly even under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and is suitable for real-time, low-resource clinical deployment. Compared to complex hybrid architectures (e.g., CNN-LSTM, RCED-Net, dual-attention models), the proposed method offers superior computational efficiency, lower memory usage, and greater practicality for portable fetal monitoring systems. The results are benchmarked against previous studies, including those using private datasets and advanced preprocessing, confirming the model\u2019s strong performance with minimal data and processing. The research underscores the potential of 1D-CNNs in scalable, efficient fetal cardiac monitoring across diverse clinical settings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-22999-9)\n\n**Peering inside the black box by learning the relevance of many-body functions in neural network potentials**\nThis article presents a study on interpreting neural network potentials (NNPs) in coarse-grained (CG) molecular systems using a method called Graph Neural Network Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (GNN-LRP). The research focuses on enhancing trust in NNPs by demonstrating the physical plausibility of learned interactions. In two case studies\u2014bulk methane (CH\u2084) and water (H\u2082O)\u2014GNN-LRP reveals that both PaiNN and SO3Net GNN architectures produce consistent 2-body and 3-body relevance contributions, indicating they learn the same underlying energy landscape. For methane, 3-body interactions are negligible, while for water, significant 3-body contributions align with known hydrogen bonding behavior, including stabilizing effects at ~50\u201360\u00b0 angles and destabilizing corrections to overstructured 2-body terms. GNN-LRP further uncovers model artifacts: a PaiNN model for methane shows rare stabilizing 3-body contributions at short distances, which are absent in training data, suggesting a potential overfitting issue not detectable via standard MD simulations. In a second example, the method is applied to the protein NTL9 (PDB ID: 2HBA), where GNN-LRP identifies stabilizing 2-body interactions in \u03b2-sheets and \u03b1-helices, including a destabilizing VAL3-GLU38 interaction consistent with known repulsive side-chain interactions. The method also distinguishes two folding pathways (P1 and P2) by analyzing relevance differences in intermediate states, showing that P1 retains native-like \u03b2-sheets but with reduced stability, while P2 forms only the \u03b2-sheet. Mutations (ILE4ASN and LEU30PHE) are simulated, and relevance changes confirm that the model captures hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions and non-local packing effects. Overall, GNN-LRP enables interpretable, physically meaningful insights into NNPs, validating their reliability and exposing hidden deficiencies beyond traditional performance metrics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65863-0)\n\n**From Real to Complex: Exploring \"Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Deep Learning\"**\nComplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are an emerging advancement in deep learning that operate on complex numbers\u2014numbers with both real and imaginary components (a + bi, where i = \u221a-1)\u2014to better model data with inherent magnitude and phase information, such as signals, waves, and quantum states. Unlike traditional real-valued neural networks, CVNNs use complex weights, complex inputs, specialized complex activation functions, and Wirtinger calculus for backpropagation. They excel in domains like signal processing, telecommunications, quantum computing, and medical imaging (e.g., MRI), where phase and amplitude must be jointly represented. Despite their advantages in capturing complex patterns, CVNNs face challenges due to the need for advanced mathematical frameworks and limited software/hardware support, as mainstream machine learning tools lack native complex number handling.

Occlusion\u2014when body parts are hidden from view\u2014leads traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to produce unreliable or incorrect predictions, such as (0,0) coordinates for missing joints, which can ruin downstream applications like VR avatars, ergonomics analysis (REBA/RULA), and sports biomechanics. The solution lies in synthetic 3D data generated using Blender as a 'data factory' and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that model the human body as a graph of interconnected joints and bones. Using Blender\u2019s Python API (bpy), thousands of synthetic scenarios are created where body parts are intentionally obscured by objects like walls or tables. Each scenario generates a corrupted 2D image (input) and a full 3D skeleton JSON file (label) showing the true joint positions. This training data teaches the model to infer hidden joints. GNNs then process a 'partial graph' of visible joints and use learned kinematic constraints (e.g., joint movement limits) to predict missing joint positions. The result is a complete, logically consistent skeleton. This approach, combining synthetic data and GNNs, enables AI not just to see but to understand and infer missing body parts, significantly improving reliability in VR, ergonomics, sports tracking, rehabilitation, and augmented reality.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 11:46 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@toreeren2/yapay-zekan%C4%B1n-x-i%C5%9F%C4%B1n%C4%B1-bak%C4%B1%C5%9F%C4%B1-blender-ve-gnnler-g%C3%B6r%C3%BCnmeyen-eklemleri-nas%C4%B1l-tahmin-ediyor-d858b750d82a)\n\n**LSTM, RNN, and ANN Explained**\nThe article explains three neural network architectures used in deep learning: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. ANNs are the foundational model, consisting of input, hidden, and output layers with weighted connections and activation functions, used for classification, regression, and pattern recognition, but they lack the ability to process sequential data or retain memory. RNNs are designed for sequential data by maintaining an internal state through loops and shared parameters across time steps, enabling applications in natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series prediction; however, they suffer from vanishing/exploding gradients and struggle with long-term dependencies. LSTMs are a specialized form of RNN that overcome these limitations using memory cells and three gates\u2014forget, input, and output\u2014to selectively retain or discard information, making them highly effective for tasks like speech recognition, machine translation, time series forecasting, and sentiment analysis. LSTMs are more stable, better at capturing long-term dependencies, and have a more robust training process than standard RNNs. The hierarchical relationship is: ANNs encompass RNNs, and RNNs include LSTMs. Each architecture evolves to address the shortcomings of the previous one, particularly in handling sequential and temporally dependent data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 03:16 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@siddhantshelake/lstm-rnn-and-ann-explained-903ed8fb361f)\n\n**GCACL-Rec: A study on conversational recommendation via global context-aware and multi-view contrastive adversarial joint learning**\nThe article introduces GCACL-Rec, a novel session-based recommendation model designed to overcome key limitations in current approaches. Traditional recommender systems rely on long-term historical data, but in domains like e-commerce and streaming media, such data is often sparse. Session-based recommendation (SBR) addresses this by predicting user interests from recent click sequences. While deep learning methods such as RNNs and GNNs have advanced SBR, they face two critical issues: (1) reliance on single-session data, ignoring cross-session relationships, and (2) modeling sessions as directed subgraphs, which reduces item transitions to pairwise interactions and misses higher-order patterns. To address these, GCACL-Rec integrates a global-level Multi-Scale Graph Neural Network (MSGNN) that captures complex item transitions across sessions using external hypernodes to aggregate semantically related sessions and a relative multi-head attention mechanism for position-sensitive dependencies. For local modeling, a Position-aware Graph Neural Network (P-GNN) uses positional encoding to capture sequential dependencies within sessions. The model also incorporates MPACL, a Multi-Perspective Adversarial Contrastive Learning framework that constructs diverse session views and uses adversarial training to improve feature robustness and discrimination. In prediction, a hybrid module combines Neural Decision Forests (NDF) for nonlinear transition modeling and softmax for linear interpretability. The study claims these innovations enhance the model\u2019s ability to learn diverse item transition patterns by integrating intra-session dynamics and inter-session relations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[PLOS](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0335176)\n\n**Enhancing digital twin performance through optimizing graph reduction of finite element models - Scientific Reports**\nThis study explores optimizing graph reduction techniques in finite element models (FEMs) to enhance the performance of digital twin systems. The digital twin operates in a computational 'digital space' derived from the physical mechanical structure, where FEMs are transformed into graph structures with nodes representing physical points and edges capturing connectivity. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage these graphs to simulate mechanical responses efficiently. The research evaluates four graph reduction methods\u2014shortest path connectivity, Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)-based reduction, Laplacian matrix-based spectral reduction with edge pruning, and a comparison framework\u2014aimed at preserving structural integrity while improving computational efficiency. The models tested include Beam2D, Beam3D, Fibonacci Spiral, and Airplane structures, all under static loading with linear elastic behavior. Data from FEM simulations (including displacement, strain, and stress) were used to train GNNs, with predictive accuracy assessed using a modified loss function that emphasizes maximum error. The study uses cross-validation across ten experiments to ensure robustness. Key metrics include model training time, reduction efficiency, and preservation of structural features. The Laplacian-based method, which retains dominant eigenvectors and applies stress-based edge thresholding, demonstrated strong performance in balancing accuracy and sparsity. The research highlights the importance of incorporating mechanical stress values as edge weights and leveraging spectral properties to maintain essential topological characteristics in reduced graphs.

AI-powered video enhancement uses deep learning algorithms to automatically improve resolution, reduce artifacts, and clean visual noise\u2014without manual editing. Unlike traditional methods that relied on static filters or pixel stretching, AI models such as SRCNN, ESRGAN, VDSR, and deep CNN denoisers analyze vast datasets to predict and reconstruct missing details, restoring textures, edges, and colors in real time. AI upscaling enhances low-resolution videos (e.g., 720p to 1080p or 4K) by intelligently generating realistic pixel data based on learned patterns. Noise reduction distinguishes between actual visual content and anomalies caused by low light, compression, or poor transmission, applying selective filtering while preserving detail and ensuring temporal consistency across frames. These technologies enable streaming platforms to deliver HD or 4K-quality experiences from lower-resolution sources, optimize bandwidth, extend content longevity, and reduce production costs. Major platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime Video use AI for dynamic encoding and artifact reduction. Independent creators use tools like Topaz Video Enhance AI for 4K upscaling. Despite challenges such as high computational costs, training data demands, latency, and risk of over-enhancement, advancements in edge computing and optimized neural networks are mitigating these issues. A recommended roadmap includes selecting frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, leveraging pre-trained models, integrating cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), optimizing for edge devices, and continuous testing. Partnering with a professional video streaming app development company ensures effective AI integration, enabling platforms to deliver smarter, sharper, and more immersive viewing experiences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 10:12 AM\nSource:[DEV Community](https://dev.to/lacey_glenn_e95da24922778/how-ai-enhances-video-quality-upscaling-and-noise-reduction-techniques-4jnd)\n\n**DGIST Achieves Major Breakthrough in High-Density AI Chips Mimicking Human Brain Function**\nThe Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST), led by Professor Soo-hyun Choi from the Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Computer Engineering, has successfully achieved large-scale integration of memristors on a 4-inch wafer, marking a significant advancement toward realizing high-density AI semiconductors at the level of the human brain. Memristors, which can remember the amount of current that has passed through them and perform both memory and computation simultaneously, offer a promising alternative to conventional semiconductors due to their simple structure and high integration density. However, previous memristor integration technologies were limited to small-scale experiments and faced challenges such as complex fabrication processes, low yield, voltage loss, and current leakage, hindering large-scale wafer-level expansion. To overcome these issues, the DGIST team collaborated with Professor Dmitri Strukov\u2019s team at UC Santa Barbara, adopting a novel co-design approach integrating materials, devices, circuits, and algorithms. This method enabled the creation of memristor crossbar circuits across the entire 4-inch wafer with over 95% yield, without complex processes. The team also successfully implemented a 3D stacked structure, demonstrating the potential for scaling memristor-based circuits into large-scale AI systems. Furthermore, applying spiking neural networks (SNN) to the technology confirmed high efficiency and stable operation in real AI computations. Professor Choi stated that the research provides an effective solution to overcome previous limitations in memristor integration and expects it to drive the development of next-generation AI semiconductor platforms.

A graph consists of nodes and edges; in a social network, for example, people are nodes and friendships are edges. The core idea of a GNN is that each node aggregates information from its neighbors\u2014a process called 'message passing' or 'neighborhood aggregation'. This aggregation is repeated across layers, allowing the model to capture higher\u2011order structural patterns.\n\nCNNs and RNNs are inadequate for graphs because graphs are irregular: the number of neighbors varies, there is no fixed ordering of nodes, and the model must be permutation\u2011invariant. GNNs address these challenges by learning how to combine a node\u2019s own features with its neighbors\u2019 features during training, enabling end\u2011to\u2011end learning that adapts embeddings to the specific task.\n\nThe article outlines several GNN families:\n- **GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)**: generalizes convolution to graphs using a normalized mean of neighbors\u2019 features; simple but can oversmooth.\n- **GraphSAGE**: inductive learning with flexible aggregators (mean, LSTM, pooling); scalable to large graphs.\n- **GAT (Graph Attention Network)**: uses attention to weight neighbors differently; more expressive but computationally heavier.\n- **GIN (Graph Isomorphism Network)**: employs sum aggregation plus an MLP, matching the Weisfeiler\u2011Lehman test for graph isomorphism; powerful for tasks requiring fine structural discrimination.\n\nThe article concludes by noting that the choice of GNN architecture depends on the application, with no single model universally best.\n\nKey quotes: 'message passing' or 'neighborhood aggregation'; 'dynamic neighbor aggregation'; 'end\u2011to\u2011end learning'; 'task adaptability'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 07:53 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@yaylakubra144/what-is-gnn-3cd366ea853a)\n\n**Why Graph Neural Networks Are AI's Next Big Thing**\nThe article explains that Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a new AI paradigm that learns from the relationships between data points rather than treating them as isolated entries. It describes the core mechanism of GNNs\u2014message passing\u2014where each node in a graph repeatedly sends, aggregates, and updates information with its direct neighbors, enabling a node to build a rich understanding of its local and eventually global neighbourhood. The piece cites the phrase \u2018message passing\u2019 as the defining abstraction of GNNs, quoting a source that states, 'They demonstrated its power on quantum chemistry tasks, solidifying message passing as the core abstraction of GNNs.' (GNN models and scalability techniques.pdf, p.\u202f4). \n\nThe article then discusses the scalability challenge of early GNNs, which required loading an entire graph into memory, and introduces sampling techniques such as GraphSAGE and clustering methods like Cluster\u2011GCN that reduce computational cost. It quotes, 'By sampling, it avoids having to load the entire neighbor set of high\u2011degree nodes (which could be thousands) and ensures a fixed computational cost per node.' (GNN models and scalability techniques.pdf, p.\u202f6). The author notes that Pinterest\u2019s recommendation engine, PinSage, applies these ideas to a graph with billions of nodes and edges.\n\nA new development highlighted is the Graph Transformer, which replaces local message passing with global self\u2011attention, allowing any node to interact with any other node in a single step. The article quotes, 'Graph Transformers introduced global self\u2011attention on graphs, allowing long\u2011range interaction beyond local neighborhoods, and achieved state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art results on various graph benchmarks.' (GNN models and scalability techniques.pdf, p.\u202f4). This approach addresses the dilution problem that can occur when many message\u2011passing steps are needed for distant nodes to communicate.\n\nOverall, the article serves as an explanatory overview of GNNs, their scalability solutions, and the emerging Graph Transformer architecture, emphasizing how these models enable AI systems to understand complex relational data in domains such as social networks, molecular chemistry, and recommendation engines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 29, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@theBotGroup/why-graph-neural-networks-are-ais-next-big-thing-cf22c13338d3)\n\n**Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Graph\u2011Neural\u2011Network Framework Revolutionises Chip\u2011Layout Design**\nThe article reports on a 2024 study published in the IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration Systems, in which Alibaba Cloud\u2019s Intelligent Group introduced a novel chip\u2011layout optimisation framework that uses graph neural networks (GNNs).

    "summary": "Experts from diverse fields\u2014including data science, technology journalism, streaming media industry, computer science, information science, and communication studies\u2014converge in their assessment that it is unlikely a major streaming platform will publicly confirm the use of a GNN-based recommendation system before 2026. Their probability estimates range from 13% to 32%, with most clustering between 13% and 28%. The main reasons cited are the substantial technical and operational challenges of using GNNs at global streaming scale, the lag between research and robust production deployment, and the high threshold for public confirmation as required by the resolution criteria (i.e., an explicit statement via an official channel regarding GNNs in production recommendation, not just experimental or research use). While the technical maturity and research momentum around GNNs are increasing, the prevailing disclosure culture of secrecy, competitive risk aversion, and the higher perceived value of alternative AI technologies (such as transformers) combine to suppress the probability of an imminent public announcement. A few incentives for disclosure exist\u2014such as recruitment, PR, or competitive positioning\u2014but these are not judged sufficient to outweigh the structural barriers and historical lag in publicizing major recommendation architecture shifts. All experts note that recombinant architectures or pilot deployments may be ongoing internally at platforms like Netflix, Amazon, or Disney+, but without a public, official announcement, the question will resolve 'No'. Only if a platform decides to use such confirmation strategically for brand or recruiting would a 'Yes' scenario emerge. The consensus is thus strongly skeptical of a positive resolution by end of 2025.",
