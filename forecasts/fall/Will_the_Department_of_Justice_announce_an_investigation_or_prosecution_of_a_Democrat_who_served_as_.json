News stories point to existing indictments and ongoing investigations of at least one impeachment manager (James Comey: not a congressional leader, but Letitia James: not a congressional leader, Adam Schiff: impeachment manager and currently under public DOJ investigation). If Schiff is indicted or DOJ announces the case before Jan 2026, a 'Yes' resolves.

Schiff is actively under DOJ investigation for alleged mortgage fraud, with credible news reports detailing legal defense preparations and DOJ efforts, but the investigation is not yet announced as an indictment. The department is issuing subpoenas and grand jury proceedings targeting significant Obama- and Biden-era officials. Given this pace and Trump\u2019s persistent public/interpersonal pressure, it is highly probable that at least one qualifying Democrat will be publicly announced as the subject of an investigation or prosecution by January 1, 2026. Judicial pushback may block convictions or erode legitimacy, but the resolution only requires an official DOJ announcement.

Alternatively, more expansive probes into Obama/Biden-era intelligence/policy actors could rope in a qualifying former vice president or congressional leader (less likely but not impossible).

The public record suggests at least two qualifying Yes instances have already occurred (the James indictment definitely fits the impeachment manager criteria), and, if not already caught by the corresponding Metaculus question, further announcements are highly probable absent unexpected legal or political intervention. Judicial and internal DOJ pushback might slow the pace or reduce the credibility of these actions, but is unlikely to fully block public announcement of new high-profile investigations or charges in the next 14 months, given current political momentum and the leadership\u2019s willingness to use the DOJ as a tool of retributive politics.\n\nTherefore, the probability is extremely high\u2014unless the specific downstream Metaculus resolution hinges on technicalities that dispute whether James/Schiff announcements count (which is not indicated by current scenario descriptions, as impeachment managers are explicitly listed).

Both the substance and the optics (including White House and DOJ press office statements) leave little ambiguity that high-profile Democrats from the specified classes have been (and are being) formally investigated/prosecuted, and these actions have been announced by the DOJ. While judicial resistance and concerns about evidence or politicization may derail or torpedo specific cases before trial, these factors do not negate that a public announcement was made, as required by the resolution criteria.

The public record shows overt White House/Trump pressure, the placement of loyalists in key DOJ roles to ensure compliance, and DOJ actions apparently oriented more toward political messaging and retribution than neutral law enforcement. Multiple news sources confirm these DOJ actions have in fact been publicly announced, not limited to internal or unofficial leaks. With the legal bar set at official DOJ announcement\u2014not actual conviction or sustainable charges\u2014the base rate has already risen above prior historical precedents. While legal and institutional pushback exists, it so far has only delayed or complicated these prosecutions, not stopped the public announcements. The list of covered roles/individuals is broad and already being targeted. Given current trends and the legal/political context, the probability is exceedingly high that at least one new investigation/prosecution will be officially announced by DOJ before Jan 1, 2026, if it has not occurred already. Only a radical, rapid reversal of current policy\u2014highly unlikely given incentives\u2014would avert this. Thus, as of this date and based on the best available evidence from both base rates and current trajectory, the forecast must be very close to certainty.",

The media outlets cited in the news dump (CNN, NBC, The Hill, Fox News, AP) indicate that these announcements are public, official, and widely reported.

The only uncertainty would arise if, for some reason, these DOJ actions were not deemed official or sufficiently public by the question resolvers. However, the breadth of coverage and the specificity of the actions (grand jury indictments, official DOJ filings, press conferences, public court documents) strongly point toward Yes. The only caution would be if announcements referenced in the press are somehow not direct DOJ announcements or fail to qualify under Metaculus's interpretation.

The report highlights that federal prosecutor Jason A. Reding Qui\u00f1ones in the Southern District of Florida is expanding an investigation into a purported 'grand conspiracy' against Trump, issuing over two dozen subpoenas\u2014including to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI agent Peter Strzok. The prosecution's central narrative\u2014that 'deep state' Democrats conspired to undermine Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and presidency\u2014remains 'unsupported by the evidence,' according to the NYT. The report concludes that while it is unclear whether the subpoenas will result in charges or convictions, the mere act of naming and shaming political foes serves as a symbolic victory for Trump\u2019s base, who view such actions as a legitimate function of law enforcement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 02:05 AM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-2674280080/)\n\n**How an Adam Schiff indictment could shake the Senate**\nSen.

Volume II, detailing the classified documents case, remains under a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge known for delaying proceedings against him. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a November 3 order, criticized Cannon for 'undue delay' and gave her 60 days to act on requests from American Oversight and the Knight First Amendment Institute to lift the gag order. Republicans in Congress, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan and Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, have demanded that Smith testify in private interviews.

Chuck Grassley, have requested private testimony from special counsel Jack Smith regarding his investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s conduct after the 2020 election, particularly concerning the hoarding of classified documents. Smith, through his legal team, has expressed willingness to testify but insists on an open hearing rather than a closed-door session, citing the need for guidance from the Department of Justice on disclosing federal grand jury information, including Volume II of his report. This volume, which details the classified documents case, remains under a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee with a history of delaying proceedings against him. A three-judge panel from the 11th Circuit has ordered Cannon to act within 60 days on requests to lift the gag order, criticizing her for 'undue delay.' If Cannon delays until January, the case could be appealed to the 11th Circuit, and Trump may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats and advocacy groups like American Oversight and the Knight First Amendment Institute are pushing for transparency, arguing that public testimony could accelerate the release of Volume II. The author contends that Republicans\u2019 demand for private hearings raises questions about what they might be hiding, especially since they claim to seek justice. The situation could extend into the 2026 midterm elections, with Trump likely opposing any public scrutiny that undermines his efforts to rewrite his post-2020 narrative.

The motion claims the indictment violates the Fifth Amendment, citing Trump\u2019s repeated derogatory remarks\u2014such as calling her 'SCUM,' 'a Complete and Total Disaster,' 'racist,' 'weak,' and 'a monster'\u2014as evidence of unconstitutional targeting. James\u2019s attorneys assert that the charges were triggered by her 2022 civil fraud investigation into Trump\u2019s business empire, which resulted in a $354.8 million penalty (over $500 million with interest) before being overturned on appeal. The motion characterizes the DOJ\u2019s actions as 'invidious and in bad faith,' alleging the department is 'too tainted with unconstitutional motivation' to prosecute fairly. James pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and making false statements related to her Virginia home mortgage, where she allegedly misrepresented her intent to use the property as a secondary residence, saving nearly $19,000. She has repeatedly denounced the charges as 'baseless' and part of a 'weaponizing of justice for political gain,' vowing to 'not bow, not break, not bend' at a rally for a mayoral candidate. The trial is scheduled for January 26, 2026. Alongside James, the DOJ indicted other perceived political opponents, including former FBI Director James Comey and former national security adviser John Bolton, who also pleaded not guilty. Trump denied the charges were politically motivated, claiming he was 'mild-mannered' and that the indictments were necessary to protect his ability to run for president, stating, 'Otherwise, I couldn't have run for president.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 03:01 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5596447-letitia-james-motion-to-dismiss-mortage-fraud-charges-trump-admin/)\n\n**How an Adam Schiff indictment could shake the Senate**\nSen.

What are they hiding? | Opinion - Yahoo News Canada**\nJack Smith, the special counsel appointed in 2022 to investigate Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, released Volume I of his report two weeks before Trump\u2019s 2024 inauguration, after the indictment against Trump was dropped due to DOJ protocols prohibiting prosecution of sitting presidents. Volume II, detailing the classified documents case, remains under a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge known for delaying proceedings against him. The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a November 3 order, criticized Cannon for 'undue delay' and gave her 60 days to act on requests from American Oversight and the Knight First Amendment Institute to lift the gag order. Republicans in Congress, including House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan and Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, have demanded that Smith testify in private interviews. Smith\u2019s legal team responded on October 23, stating he is willing to testify but requires guidance from the Department of Justice on disclosing grand jury information, including Volume II, and insists on an open hearing. Democrats have supported Smith\u2019s call for transparency. Scott Wilkens of the Knight First Amendment Institute noted that public testimony could accelerate public access to Volume II. The standoff may extend into the 2026 midterm elections, with Trump opposing transparency as he seeks to rewrite the narrative around his post-2020 conduct. The article questions whether Republican demands for private testimony conceal an intent to avoid public scrutiny of Volume II.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/gop-pushes-trump-prosecutor-jack-090226145.html)\n\n**DOJ prepares subpoenas in sweeping criminal probe of Obama-era Trump-Russia investigation**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing grand jury subpoenas as part of a sweeping criminal probe into the Obama-era investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to sources familiar with the matter. The probe, led by Jason Reding Qui\u00f1ones, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and a close associate of Attorney General Pam Bondi, targets former top officials from the Obama administration, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan. The subpoenas seek documents related to the 2016 Russia investigation, which began under President Barack Obama. The probe may extend beyond those involved in the original Russia inquiry to include Biden administration officials who investigated Donald Trump for mishandling classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Former FBI Director James Comey, indicted on unrelated charges in September 2024 following Trump\u2019s demands, is also under scrutiny, with his defense team preparing for potential inclusion. Trump has publicly called for prosecutions of figures including Adam Schiff, Jack Smith, Merrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, and Chris Wray, accusing them of a 'corrupt J-6 Witch Hunt.' Critics, including Democrats and former intelligence officials, argue the investigation is politically motivated and baseless, citing multiple bipartisan reviews\u2014such as the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s 2019 report\u2014that confirmed Russian interference in 2016, though no conclusive evidence of campaign collusion was found. The DOJ has not commented. The Miami-based investigation is reportedly recruiting prosecutors and restructuring its national security unit, with a grand jury expected to convene in Fort Pierce, Florida, to avoid perceived Democratic bias in Washington, D.C. Republican lawmakers and Trump allies claim a 'treasonous conspiracy' by Obama and Biden officials, citing alleged politicization of intelligence, including the use of the Steele dossier. However, the DOJ\u2019s own special counsel John Durham found no criminal wrongdoing in the original investigation. The probe marks Trump\u2019s most ambitious effort to weaponize federal law enforcement against perceived political adversaries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 01:41 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/doj-prepares-subpoenas-sweeping-criminal-014139441.html)\n\n**If Arctic Frost Perpetrators Don't Go To Jail, Conservatives Will**\nThe article claims that the Biden Administration's 'Arctic Frost' operation, led by Attorney General Merrick Garland and Special Counsel Jack Smith, was a partisan, illegal effort to surveil and prosecute the Republican Party under the guise of investigating January 6th. According to the article, Smith secretly surveilled at least eight Republican senators without probable cause, issued 197 subpoenas to 430 individuals and organizations\u2014many unrelated to January 6th or even non-existent at the time\u2014and demanded access to private donor data, banking records, and media contacts. The subpoenas were accompanied by gag orders preventing phone companies from informing senators, a move alleged to be a federal crime. Despite spending millions in legal fees, the investigation yielded no evidence of wrongdoing. The article argues that if Donald Trump had not won the 2024 election, the operation would have continued, potentially leading to indictments, de-banking, and arrests of conservative figures under a future Democratic administration. It asserts that the perpetrators\u2014DOJ prosecutors, FBI agents, and judges\u2014remain in their positions and are emboldened, not deterred, by past actions. The article calls on Republicans to respond with severe legal consequences: congressional hearings, disbarment, impeachment, prosecution, imprisonment, and pension forfeiture for those involved in Arctic Frost. It frames this not as revenge, but as necessary justice to deter future abuses of power by Democratic elites, warning that without such action, the Republican Party risks existential threat. The article concludes that the only remaining restraint on Democrat power is fear, and that Republicans must enforce the rule of law to restore balance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 12:17 PM\nSource:[The Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2025/11/06/if-arctic-frost-perpetrators-dont-go-to-jail-conservatives-will/)\n\n**Judge Questions Justice Department\u2019s Approach in Comey Prosecution**\nFederal magistrate judge William Fitzpatrick of the Eastern District of Virginia issued a rare public warning to the Justice Department (DOJ) on November 5, 2025, suggesting that prosecutors in the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey may have mishandled evidence and prioritized indictment over thorough investigation. During a brief hearing, Fitzpatrick stated, 'Right now, we are in a bit of a feeling of indict first, investigate later,' marking an unusual judicial rebuke of DOJ procedures. The remark underscores internal concerns within the DOJ, with multiple career prosecutors reportedly questioning the case\u2019s merit and timing. Critics allege the prosecution is politically motivated, targeting Comey\u2014whose 2017 dismissal by former President Donald Trump sparked obstruction allegations\u2014during a sensitive period in U.S. politics. The Eastern District of Virginia, a common venue for national security cases due to its proximity to Washington, D.C., has drawn defense scrutiny over potential jury bias. Legal experts note that such judicial warnings often precede serious consequences, including evidence exclusion or dismissal of charges. The DOJ has not yet publicly responded to the judge\u2019s concerns. The defense may now file motions challenging the adequacy of the pre-indictment investigation, potentially delaying trial proceedings. The case raises broader questions about judicial oversight and prosecutorial accountability in high-profile, politically charged prosecutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[The Dupree Report](https://www.thedupreereport.com/2025/11/judge-warns-doj-comey/)\n\n**Judge scolds Comey prosecutors, orders records to be produced**\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered prosecutors to provide grand jury records and evidence from the investigation into former FBI Director James Comey by the end of Thursday, November 6, 2025, criticizing the Department of Justice (DOJ) for 'indict first and investigate later.' Comey, who was present at the hearing but did not speak, and his lawyers stated they had not seen the materials, prompting the judge to declare, 'We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today.' The materials include communications between Comey and Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman, a special government employee at the FBI, seized in 2019 and 2020. Prosecutors allege Comey encouraged Richman to speak with reporters and lied to Congress about authorizing anonymous sources. Comey pleaded not guilty last month to charges related to false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020, where he claimed he did not authorize a media leak about the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton and the Trump-Russia probe. The DOJ defended President Trump's social media posts calling for Comey's prosecution, asserting they were not retaliatory, while Comey's lawyers argued the case is politically motivated and a departure from the DOJ's traditional ethical standards. Trump had used Truth Social to call for the prosecution of Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former national security advisor John Bolton, all of whom have since been indicted. Comey's legal team emphasized that the DOJ has historically followed only facts and law, and this case represents a sharp break from that tradition.

According to the book, Garland\u2019s decision-making was marked by excessive caution, a desire to avoid setting legal precedents, and a freeze on both cases before the 2022 midterms\u2014even though Trump was not on the ballot and had not yet declared his 2024 candidacy. Dilanian reports that these delays, driven by a 'conservative interpretation' of DOJ policies, may have hampered federal criminal investigations. While Dilanian acknowledges that Garland\u2019s critics on the right were wrong to claim the Justice Department was weaponized against Trump, he argues that Garland\u2019s actions were still problematic, as they prioritized the appearance of impartiality and political optics over justice. The author of the article contends that Garland\u2019s choices were influenced by fear of backlash from rightwing media and political pressure, even if no direct White House interference occurred. The delays allowed the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down Colorado\u2019s decision to bar Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment, effectively removing a legal check on Trump before the 2024 election. The article warns that this precedent enables powerful figures to act with impunity, and argues that Dilanian\u2019s portrayal of Garland as having done 'things right' is misleading\u2014it reflects a political bias that downplays Garland\u2019s failure to prioritize justice over image. The piece concludes that future accountability efforts must learn from Garland\u2019s mistakes and that systemic reforms\u2014such as abolishing ICE or expanding the Supreme Court\u2014are necessary to prevent future democratic erosion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/criticism-of-merrick-garland/)\n\n**DOJ defends Trump Truth Social post as Comey seeks to have case dismissed**\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) defended the federal case against former FBI Director James Comey in a 48-page filing, urging a court to reject his motion to dismiss the indictment. Comey, indicted in late September on charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation, pleaded not guilty. His legal team argued that the prosecution was vindictive and selective, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s September Truth Social post calling for the prosecution of political adversaries\u2014including Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff, and New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2014as evidence of political bias. The DOJ countered that Trump\u2019s post reflected his personal views on the need for prosecution but did not constitute direct evidence of a vindictive motive. Prosecutors emphasized that the decision to prosecute was made by DOJ officials, not the President, and that there was no direct admission of discriminatory intent. They dismissed Comey\u2019s claims as requiring 'leaps of logic and a big dose of cynicism.' Additionally, Comey\u2019s team challenged the validity of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan\u2019s appointment, arguing it was unconstitutional and unlawful, since she was Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and replaced Erik Siebert, who resigned under pressure to indict Comey and James. The DOJ maintained that Halligan\u2019s appointment complied with federal law and the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause.

Prosecutors defended Trump\u2019s September 2020 social media post calling for action against Comey, stating it reflects a 'legitimate prosecutorial motive' rather than political spite. They emphasized that the decision to prosecute was made by DOJ officials, not the president, and dismissed Comey\u2019s argument as requiring 'leaps of logic and a big dose of cynicism.' The case centers on Comey\u2019s indictment for allegedly lying to Congress on September 30, 2020, regarding whether he authorized FBI leaks to the media about investigations involving Trump and Hillary Clinton. Prosecutors cited communications between Comey and Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor, to support the claim that Comey encouraged media disclosures. Comey\u2019s defense argues the Senate questions from Senator Ted Cruz were vague and ambiguous, specifically referencing Andrew McCabe, not Richman, making it impossible for Comey to have intended to lie. Additionally, Comey\u2019s lawyers are challenging the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide with no prior federal prosecution experience, as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after Erik Siebert\u2019s resignation under administration pressure. The defense has also requested access to grand jury transcripts and audio recordings, alleging factual and legal errors may have influenced the indictment.

The operation issued 197 subpoenas to over 430 individuals and organizations, including high-profile figures such as Stephen Miller, Dan Scavino, Jared Kushner, and Lara Trump, as well as banks, media outlets like CBS and Fox News, and 11 members of Congress whose phone records were secretly subpoenaed. One subpoena to AT&T for Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s cell phone records was denied due to constitutional protections, but the company was silenced by a secret court order from Judge James Boasberg, who cited risks of evidence tampering and witness intimidation. Cruz publicly waived the gag order and denounced the order as a weaponization of the judiciary, calling for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment. Republican senators, including Charles E. Grassley and Lindsey Graham, condemned the probe as a 'fishing expedition' and an abuse of power, arguing it was politically motivated and targeted Republicans solely because of Trump\u2019s campaign. Graham claimed the investigation was a 'Democratic machine' effort to derail Trump\u2019s political comeback. Smith, who indicted Trump on August 1, 2023, for election interference related to the 2020 election, maintains his decision was justified, stating Trump made 'knowingly false claims of election fraud' and that he would have been convicted had Trump not won re-election.

It asserts that since Trump became a Republican candidate, he faced a series of 'meritless' investigations, prosecutions, and civil suits orchestrated by Democratic officials, including FBI agents, DOJ attorneys, and judges. Specific allegations include the framing of Trump as a Russian spy, the use of warrantless raids on his residence, rewriting civil statutes to target him, and attempting to imprison him for lawful actions such as pursuing remedies to the 2020 election results, possessing exculpatory documents, and allegedly engaging in 'insurrection.' The article claims that Trump\u2019s associates\u2014including Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Steve Bannon, and Peter Navarro\u2014were targeted, harassed, arrested, or prosecuted. It further alleges that thousands of ordinary Trump supporters were similarly victimized. The piece contrasts this treatment with the leniency shown to left-wing rioters during the 2020 protests, which it labels as 'domestic terrorism' but were celebrated by Democrats as the 'Summer of Love.' It criticizes Democratic hypocrisy, citing examples such as the IRS targeting conservative nonprofits under Obama, FEMA ignoring Trump-supporters during hurricanes under Biden, and prosecutors failing to act against violent attacks on religious and pro-life institutions. The article accuses prominent Democrats\u2014including J.B. Pritzker, Mark Kelly, Eric Swalwell, and James Carville\u2014of inciting violence, calling for the persecution of Trump supporters, and threatening future retribution.

Among Democrats, 85% agreed with this view, compared to only 29% of Republicans. The poll, which included 4,385 U.S. adults, was released amid heightened political tensions following Trump\u2019s September 20 post on Truth Social urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), stating, 'Justice must be served, now!!!' Bondi denied that the DOJ's investigations are politically motivated during a Senate Judiciary Committee appearance on October 7, asserting that Trump has been transparent.

Schiff emphasized that Trump\u2019s 'long and growing' list of opponents includes not only Democrats but also Republicans, citing recent indictments of high-profile figures such as New York Attorney General Letitia James on mortgage fraud charges and former FBI Director James Comey on counts related to congressional testimony in 2020. Trump had previously labeled Schiff, James, and Comey as 'all guilty as hell' in a Truth Social post. Schiff, who led the first impeachment inquiry into Trump in 2019 and served on the Jan. 6 House Select Committee, is reportedly under investigation for mortgage fraud in Maryland. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton is also reportedly facing potential criminal charges. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the use of the Department of Justice as a tool for political retribution, calling it 'outrageous.' Republican Rep.

Swalwell echoed this, declaring 'Accountability is coming' and framing the strategy as a deliberate use of government power to target political opponents. The article argues these statements represent a shift from oversight to intimidation, warning that Democrats\u2019 planned use of investigations and prosecutions would constitute a 'banana republic' model where political dissent is punished.

Trump was surprised to learn he had published it publicly, reacting with 'oh' and attempting to downplay it. The post, addressed to Bondi as 'Pam,' expressed frustration that 'nothing is being done' against figures including former FBI Director James Comey, Senator Adam Schiff, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom Trump labeled 'guilty as hell.' He claimed that the lack of action was damaging national credibility and demanded 'JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!' Two of the three individuals mentioned\u2014Comey and James\u2014were subsequently indicted: James on bank fraud and false statements charges by a federal grand jury, and Comey on false statements to Congress and obstruction. Two administration officials confirmed Bondi had appointed a 'special attorney' to investigate mortgage fraud allegations against James and Schiff. Legal experts and critics have raised concerns about the use of the Justice Department for political retribution, with James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, stating the case is 'driven by President Trump's desire for revenge' and constituting a 'serious attack on the rule of law.' Trump previously claimed he had no involvement in the investigations, despite publicly pressuring Bondi. Schiff, who was lead impeachment manager in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, called the targeting of political enemies 'a threat to our democracy' and stated he and others on Trump\u2019s 'enemies list' would not be intimidated. The administration has also purged Justice Department and FBI officials, including those involved in Jack Smith\u2019s investigations, prompting a letter from 42 retired judges warning that American rights and liberties are 'in grave danger' due to Trump's 'corruptly' abusing his office to target critics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 02:03 PM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-accidentally-posted-message-pressuring-pam-bondi-charge-enemies-rcna236830)\n\n**Analysis: Trump never forgets: Bombshell indictments open a new phase in a retribution presidency | CNN Politics**\nOn October 10, 2025, Donald Trump was involved in a series of high-profile indictments targeting political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey, marking a pivotal phase in what CNN describes as a 'retribution presidency.' James was indicted on two felony charges\u2014bank fraud and making false statements\u2014related to a mortgage for her Virginia home, while Comey faced charges of providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. Both cases were prosecuted by Lindsey Halligan, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and newly appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the resignation of Erik Siebert, who reportedly found insufficient evidence to support charges. The indictments come amid a broader pattern of political retribution: Trump previously demanded charges against James via a Truth Social post to Attorney General Pam Bondi, referencing her, Comey, and Senator Adam Schiff, stating, 'They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!' Critics, including NYU law professor Ryan Goodman, question the legitimacy of the cases, calling them 'deeply suspect' and politically motivated. James dismissed the charges as 'baseless' and 'a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.' The article highlights concerns about the erosion of the rule of law, citing Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops from Texas to Illinois and attempts to mobilize reservists from California\u2014actions blocked by courts. Republican Senator Elissa Slotkin warned that the president using the Justice Department to target opponents threatens democratic institutions. While Trump\u2019s supporters, like Rep. Elise Stefanik, claim James engaged in a 'political witch hunt,' the article argues that the pattern of retaliatory indictments reflects a dangerous precedent, with Senator Thom Tillis noting that 'whatever threshold gets set here is the new floor for future prosecutions.' Trump, who has long claimed he was victimized by politically driven investigations, now appears to be weaponizing the justice system in response, despite previously denying wrongdoing in multiple cases, including those related to election interference and classified documents. The article concludes that while Trump claims he would not pursue such actions, his rhetoric and actions suggest a calculated strategy of retribution, raising concerns about the future of American democracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 04:27 AM\nSource:[CNN](https://us.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-trump-indicted-comey-justice-department-analysis)\n\n**White House admits Trump's message to Bondi to prosecute enemies was supposed to be a DM: report**\nA September 20, 2025, post by Donald Trump on Truth Social, addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and urging immediate prosecution of his perceived political enemies\u2014including former FBI Director James Comey\u2014was intended as a private direct message (DM), according to White House officials. Trump believed he had sent the message directly to Bondi, but it was publicly posted, prompting surprise and backlash. The post, which accused Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Senator Adam Schiff of being 'all guilty as hell' and demanded 'justice be served' after Trump's 'impeachments and indictments,' was later followed by a corrective message praising Bondi's work. The incident highlights a significant shift in the Department of Justice, now reportedly stripped of independence under Trump and Bondi. Comey, who pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress and obstruction, faces a trial tentatively scheduled for January 5, 2026, with his attorneys planning to challenge the case on grounds of Trump's 'vindictive' prosecution. The post is expected to be central to that motion, demonstrating presidential direction to prosecute a target labeled 'guilty' before charges were filed. The administration has removed dozens of officials deemed disloyal, including Erik Siebert, the former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, whom Trump fired for refusing to pursue Comey. Trump then nominated Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer with no prosecutorial experience, to replace him. Halligan, in a rare move, personally presented the case to a grand jury, which indicted Comey on two counts\u2014false statements to Congress and obstruction\u2014after only 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor. Internal prosecutors had previously cited difficulties due to a key witness, Columbia law professor Daniel Richmond, whose testimony would create 'likely insurmountable problems' for the case. Bondi, during her January confirmation hearing, pledged to end the 'weaponization' of the Justice Department, echoing Trump\u2019s claims that his indictments were politically motivated. When questioned again in a Senate hearing, she refused to confirm whether she received White House instructions.

The piece highlights that Trump's efforts to use government power to retaliate against opponents\u2014through firings, investigations, and pressure on agencies like the FCC\u2014undermine long-standing norms of political neutrality and institutional independence. Critics, including former White House officials, conservative scholars, and nonpartisan watchdogs like Bright Line Watch, warn that such actions could lead to a cycle of retaliation, where each new administration targets its predecessor. The article notes that support among Democrats for restricting or shutting down Fox News has increased from 37% in 2021 to 50% in 2025, suggesting a growing appetite for political retribution. While Trump claims Democrats previously abused power\u2014citing four criminal charges against him post-2021\u2014his actions are seen as more overtly personal and politically driven. Unlike Biden, who relied on independent special prosecutors, Trump has directly pressured the DOJ and FBI to target critics, revoked security clearances, and dismissed career officials. Experts like Ruth Ben-Ghiat warn this reflects a 'personalist' authoritarian model, where institutions serve the leader\u2019s vendettas. Even Kash Patel, the current FBI director, faces scrutiny for breaking his promise of non-politicization. The article concludes that while Trump frames his actions as accountability, they risk normalizing political persecution and eroding democratic checks and balances, potentially endangering future conservative leaders if Democrats gain power.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 05:59 PM\nSource:[Vanguardia](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/internacional/al-perseguir-a-sus-enemigos-trump-sienta-un-precedente-que-podria-afectar-a-sus-aliados-IA17538189)\n\n**Trump ramps up retribution campaign against his political enemies**\nThe article reports that President Donald Trump has intensified his campaign to prosecute political opponents, urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue cases against figures such as New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.  Trump posted an open\u2011letter style message on social media this weekend, saying \u2018nothing is being done\u2019 on investigations into his foes and demanding that \u2018JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\u2019.  He added that he had \u2018reviewed over 30 statements and posts\u2019 that he claims criticize his administration\u2019s lack of action.  Trump later praised Bondi, writing that she was \u2018doing a GREAT job.\u2019\n\nThe piece also documents criticism from Republican Senator Rand Paul, who said it is \u2018not right for the Trump administration to do the same thing,\u2019 and from Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who called the president\u2019s direction of the DOJ \u2018unconstitutional and deeply immoral\u2019 and warned it could set a dangerous precedent.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer described the DOJ as being turned into an instrument that \u201cgoes after his enemies, whether they\u2019re guilty or not.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has also filled key legal positions with loyalists, naming former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and former attorney Alina Habba as U.S. attorneys in Washington, D.C. and New Jersey, respectively, and appointing Lindsey Halligan as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after the resignation of Erik Siebert.\n\nIn addition to legal moves, the article notes Trump\u2019s new Pentagon memo that requires credentialed journalists to sign a pledge not to report unapproved information, and his praise of ABC\u2019s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, calling it a courageous decision.  The FCC\u2019s chairman, Brendan Carr, condemned Kimmel\u2019s comments as \u2018truly sick,\u2019 while Republican Senator Ted Cruz warned that threatening to silence speech is dangerous.\n\nOverall, the article portrays Trump\u2019s actions as a concerted effort to use the Justice Department and other federal agencies to target political adversaries, drawing sharp criticism from both parties for potentially eroding democratic norms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:58 AM\nSource:[CDN Digital](https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/658585/trump-ramps-up-retribution-campaign-against-his-political-enemies)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that there is now an extremely high probability\u2014often assessed at 95-99%\u2014that the Department of Justice will (and, according to some, already has) publicly announce an investigation or prosecution of a Democrat who has served as president, vice president, congressional leader, whip, or impeachment manager before January 1, 2026. Experts from law, political science, federal law enforcement, and political analysis backgrounds highlight that this would historically be unprecedented and against long-held norms of prosecutorial restraint towards top political opponents. However, they unanimously cite detailed news reporting supporting recent DOJ indictments of Letitia James and James Comey (the former being an impeachment manager), as well as active, public DOJ investigations into Adam Schiff (also a former impeachment manager and current senator). Each expert notes the explicit pressure from President Trump and the installation of loyalists in DOJ leadership as key factors collapsing previous institutional barriers and signaling a dramatic break from precedent. Legal and judicial pushback is noted, but seen as insufficient to prevent public announcements, which alone suffice for a 'Yes' resolution under the Metaculus question's criteria. The base historical probability is acknowledged as extremely low, but experts agree that the threshold for triggering a 'Yes'\u2014formal public DOJ announcement, regardless of conviction or ultimate legal outcome\u2014has already been met or is so close as to be virtually certain barring unforeseen last-minute reversals. In summary: there is consensus that the DOJ has, or will very likely, officially announce investigations/prosecutions of qualifying high-profile Democrats prior to the deadline, due to political retribution overriding historical restraint, with credible sources and public records meeting the forecasting question's requirements.",
