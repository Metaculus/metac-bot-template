The Southern Hydrometeorological Station warned that tide peaks at Phu An Station on the Saigon River could reach 1.70\u20131.75 m\u2014above the third warning level, the highest alert\u2014between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday. This follows Typhoon Kalmaegi's expected entry into the East Sea (South China Sea) on Wednesday, which may bring up to 100 mm of rain to the city. Le Dinh Quyet, head of the weather forecasting department, stated that the combination of strong tides and heavy rain will cause severe flooding in low-lying areas and along the Saigon River. He warned that five to six more tidal peaks are expected in the final two months of 2025, and if they coincide with heavy rain or strong northeasterly winds, the flooding risk will be 'very serious.' Earlier in October, tides reached a record 1.77 m, submerging the Binh Quoi tourist area by up to one meter and affecting hundreds of households in Thanh Da. Major roads such as Tran Xuan Soan, Pham Huu Lau, and National Highway 50 were submerged, disrupting traffic. In southern provinces, including Can Tho and Vinh Long, water levels exceeded 2.3 m\u2014surpassing 2022 records\u2014causing widespread flooding of streets, homes, fruit gardens, and aquaculture ponds.

According to Roger Gass, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Bay Area office, showers will first affect the North Bay before moving southward, with the heaviest rain expected Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. San Francisco is projected to receive between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain, while higher elevations in the North Bay, including the Mayacamas and Mount Saint Helena, could see up to 2.5 inches. North Bay valleys are expected to receive 1 to 2 inches. Gass warned of 'difficult driving conditions' and noted that while major river flooding is not expected due to the region's capacity after the dry season, nuisance flooding may occur in creeks and streams\u2014particularly Mark West Creek in Sonoma County. Thunderstorms have a 20% chance in the North Bay and less than 10% in San Francisco. Wind gusts of 40\u201350 mph are expected across most of the Bay Area. The storm system is also bringing a long-period northwesterly swell that will produce sneaker waves and rip currents by Sunday, prompting a warning to stay out of the water. Conditions are expected to improve late Wednesday night into Thursday morning, with cooler temperatures lasting through Friday. This follows a record-breaking rainfall event in October 2025, when up to 1.5 inches fell in a single day\u2014equivalent to a full month\u2019s precipitation\u2014ending fire season in Northern California, according to climate scientist Daniel Swain.

The initial storm caused river level rises and triggered Flood Watches, now canceled according to FOX Weather. A new powerful low-pressure system is expected to form in the Bay of Alaska and move east toward Canada, drawing moisture from the Pacific Ocean into the Pacific Northwest by late Tuesday. The upcoming storm is projected to be a level 5/5 on the Center for Western Water and Weather Extremes scale, with the heaviest rainfall concentrated in Oregon. Between Tuesday and Thursday, coastal areas of Oregon and Washington are expected to receive 3\u20135 inches of rain, while the Olympic Mountains could see 5\u20138 inches. Southern Oregon and northern California may receive 1\u20132 inches. Flash flooding is possible, particularly Wednesday afternoon, as rain moves slowly down the Pacific Northwest coastline.

The prolonged downpour resulted from a depression that weakened into a low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea and is expected to persist for one or two more days, with light-to-moderate rains and thundershowers forecast until Wednesday. The IMD reported that Gujarat has received 128.17% of its average seasonal rainfall as of November 2, exceeding the normal seasonal total by 10 percentage points. The Southwest monsoon had officially withdrawn from Gujarat on October 10, delayed by a cyclonic system in the Arabian Sea, compared to the normal withdrawal date of October 5. District-wise rainfall data showed Porbandar recorded the highest at 72 mm in the last 24 hours, followed by Dhandhuka (63 mm), Lodhika (41 mm), Sankheda (39 mm), and Umrala (34 mm). In the morning hours (6 am to 4 pm), Dwarka (35 mm), Bhavnagar (22 mm), and several other locations received 18 mm each. Gujarat\u2019s Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel confirmed that ministers had visited affected areas, and the state government is preparing a relief package for farmers, with the announcement expected within a day or two. Patel emphasized ongoing coordination with officials and a swift review and survey of crop damage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 01:32 PM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/unseasonal-rain-likely-to-continue-in-gujarat-crops-suffer-damage-10342025/)\n\n**Wet month in Northern California eases wildfire outlook**\nNorthern California experienced a wetter-than-normal October in 2025, significantly reducing wildfire risk, according to fire experts and data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). Rainfall across the region exceeded historical averages: Lake Lagunitas received 3.53 inches (vs. 0.06 inches in 2024), San Jose recorded 2 inches (over four times its October average), Oakland received 1.64 inches (double its average), and Sacramento, Santa Rosa, and San Francisco saw 100\u2013125% of normal rainfall. Fresno and Los Angeles also saw 223% and 252% of normal rainfall, respectively, though much of Southern California, including San Diego and Palm Springs, remained below average. A single storm on October 15 brought most of Southern California\u2019s rain, but temperatures have since risen, with Los Angeles reaching 97\u00b0F. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for Ventura and Los Angeles counties due to strong winds, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to pre-position 129 firefighters, 10 engines, and three helicopters. In contrast, Northern California\u2019s moisture levels have drastically reduced fire danger: Cal Fire canceled a controlled burn in Santa Cruz County due to damp vegetation, and another in San Mateo County was abandoned after only 6 acres burned. Grass fires near San Jose and Alameda County were quickly contained, with minimal damage. Experts like Craig Clements of San Jose State University noted that the hills are already greening, and fires are unlikely to spread due to high moisture. The National Interagency Fire Center lists Northern California as having 'little or no fire risk,' while Southern California remains at 'low risk.' Dan Cayan of Scripps Institution of Oceanography noted that 90% of Southern California\u2019s fall wildfires historically occur before 0.35 inches of rain, and while fire risk remains in Southern California due to dry conditions, Northern California is in a much better position. Cal Fire has relaxed backyard burning rules in nearly all Bay Area counties and northern counties starting October 17, under permits, and staffing reductions are expected in winter. Despite this, Cal Fire warns that 80\u00b0F days with winds could still spark fires, though large-scale destructive fires are not expected due to current moisture levels.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[Marin Independent Journal](https://www.marinij.com/2025/11/02/it-rained-a-lot-in-october-is-fire-season-over-now/)\n\n**HCMC faces risk of severe flooding this week as high tides coincide with heavy rain - VnExpress International**\nHo Chi Minh City (HCMC) faces a high risk of severe flooding from November 6\u20137, 2025, due to the coincidence of high tides and heavy rainfall.

According to Roger Gass, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Bay Area office, showers will first affect the North Bay before moving southward, with the heaviest rain expected Tuesday night into Wednesday morning. San Francisco is projected to receive between 0.5 and 1 inch of rain, while higher elevations in the North Bay, including the Mayacamas and Mount Saint Helena, could see up to 2.5 inches. North Bay valleys are expected to receive 1 to 2 inches. Gass warned of 'difficult driving conditions' and noted that while major river flooding is not expected due to the region's capacity after the dry season, nuisance flooding may occur in creeks and streams\u2014particularly Mark West Creek in Sonoma County. Thunderstorms have a 20% chance in the North Bay and less than 10% in San Francisco. Wind gusts of 40\u201350 mph are expected across most of the Bay Area. The storm system is also bringing a long-period northwesterly swell that will produce sneaker waves and rip currents by Sunday, prompting a warning to stay out of the water. Conditions are expected to improve late Wednesday night into Thursday morning, with cooler temperatures lasting through Friday. This follows a record-breaking rainfall event in October 2025, when up to 1.5 inches fell in a single day\u2014equivalent to a full month\u2019s precipitation\u2014ending fire season in Northern California, according to climate scientist Daniel Swain. The NOAA 30-day outlook predicts above-normal temperatures and precipitation for November.

The prolonged downpour resulted from a depression that weakened into a low-pressure area over the Arabian Sea and is expected to persist for one or two more days, with light-to-moderate rains and thundershowers forecast until Wednesday. The IMD reported that Gujarat has received 128.17% of its average seasonal rainfall as of November 2, exceeding the normal seasonal total by 10 percentage points. The Southwest monsoon had officially withdrawn from Gujarat on October 10, delayed by a cyclonic system in the Arabian Sea, compared to the normal withdrawal date of October 5. District-wise rainfall data showed Porbandar recorded the highest at 72 mm in the last 24 hours, followed by Dhandhuka (63 mm), Lodhika (41 mm), Sankheda (39 mm), and Umrala (34 mm). In the morning hours (6 am to 4 pm), Dwarka (35 mm), Bhavnagar (22 mm), and several other locations received 18 mm each. Gujarat\u2019s Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel confirmed that ministers had visited affected areas, and the state government is preparing a relief package for farmers, with the announcement expected within a day or two. Patel emphasized ongoing coordination with officials and a swift review and survey of crop damage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 01:32 PM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/ahmedabad/unseasonal-rain-likely-to-continue-in-gujarat-crops-suffer-damage-10342025/)\n\n**Wet month in Northern California eases wildfire outlook**\nNorthern California experienced a wetter-than-normal October in 2025, significantly reducing wildfire risk, according to fire experts and data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). Rainfall across the region exceeded historical averages: Lake Lagunitas received 3.53 inches (vs. 0.06 inches in 2024), San Jose recorded 2 inches (over four times its October average), Oakland received 1.64 inches (double its average), and Sacramento, Santa Rosa, and San Francisco saw 100\u2013125% of normal rainfall. Fresno and Los Angeles also saw 223% and 252% of normal rainfall, respectively, though much of Southern California, including San Diego and Palm Springs, remained below average. A single storm on October 15 brought most of Southern California\u2019s rain, but temperatures have since risen, with Los Angeles reaching 97\u00b0F. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for Ventura and Los Angeles counties due to strong winds, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom to pre-position 129 firefighters, 10 engines, and three helicopters. In contrast, Northern California\u2019s moisture levels have drastically reduced fire danger: Cal Fire canceled a controlled burn in Santa Cruz County due to damp vegetation, and another in San Mateo County was abandoned after only 6 acres burned. Grass fires near San Jose and Alameda County were quickly contained, with minimal damage. Experts like Craig Clements of San Jose State University noted that the hills are already greening, and fires are unlikely to spread due to high moisture. The National Interagency Fire Center lists Northern California as having 'little or no fire risk,' while Southern California remains at 'low risk.' Dan Cayan of Scripps Institution of Oceanography noted that 90% of Southern California\u2019s fall wildfires historically occur before 0.35 inches of rain, and while fire risk remains in Southern California due to dry conditions, Northern California is in a much better position. Cal Fire has relaxed backyard burning rules in nearly all Bay Area counties and northern counties starting October 17, under permits, and staffing reductions are expected in winter. Despite this, Cal Fire warns that 80\u00b0F days with winds could still spark fires, though large-scale destructive fires are not expected due to current moisture levels.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[Marin Independent Journal](https://www.marinij.com/2025/11/02/it-rained-a-lot-in-october-is-fire-season-over-now/)\n\n**It rained a lot in October. Is fire season over now?**\nIn October 2025, California experienced significantly above-average rainfall, particularly in Northern California, leading fire experts to assess whether fire season has ended. According to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, fire season has likely ended in Northern California due to sufficient rainfall, while Southern California remains at elevated risk. Statewide, 522,372 acres had burned by October 27, a 40% decrease from the 5-year average of 1.3 million acres. Northern California saw substantial rain: San Jose received 2 inches (400% of average), Oakland 1.64 inches (195%), Sacramento 2 inches (200%), Santa Rosa 125%, and San Francisco 113%. Southern California rainfall was uneven\u2014Los Angeles received 1.41 inches (252% of average), Fresno 1.18 inches (223%), but San Diego and Palm Springs remained below average. A single storm on October 15 brought most of Southern California\u2019s rain, followed by rising temperatures (97\u00b0F in LA) and red flag warnings issued by the National Weather Service. In response, Governor Gavin Newsom pre-positioned 129 firefighters, 10 engines, and three helicopters. In contrast, Cal Fire canceled controlled burns in Soquel Demonstration Forest and halted a planned burn in San Mateo County due to damp vegetation. Cal Fire forester Sarah Collamer stated, 'We are getting small starts. They are going until we put them out. But the fire danger is greatly reduced.' Grass fires near Alum Rock Park (10 acres) and Altamont Pass (20 acres) were quickly contained. Craig Clements of San Jose State University noted that while grass fires can still ignite, they are unlikely to spread due to high moisture levels and green-up in the hills. The National Interagency Fire Center lists 'little or no fire risk' for most of California, except for 'low risk' in parts of southern California. Experts agree there is no fixed rainfall threshold to end fire season, but 1 inch of rain is often a benchmark. Dan Cayan of Scripps Institution of Oceanography noted that 90% of Southern California\u2019s fall fires since WWII occurred before 0.35 inches of rain fell. However, winter dry spells and Santa Ana winds can still spark fires. Historically, major fires have occurred in fall (e.g., 1991 Oakland Hills Fire, 2017 Tubbs Fire, 2018 Camp Fire), prompting officials to declare fire season year-round due to climate change. Yet, fire risk generally declines with rain, cooler temperatures, and shorter days. Cal Fire has relaxed back-yard burning rules starting October 17, allowing permits across nearly all Bay Area counties and all counties north to Oregon. Cal Fire stations have not yet reduced staffing. Capt. Robert Foxworthy warned, 'We could still have 80-degree days with winds. There's still a chance of wildfire. We're not expecting large damaging, destructive fires... but in some places there is a threat still there.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 03:51 PM\nSource:[San Jose Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/31/it-rained-a-lot-in-october-is-fire-season-over-now/)\n\n**Belo Horizonte Issues Landslide Alert After Heavy Rains**\nFollowing a full day of heavy rainfall in Belo Horizonte, the city's Civil Defense issued a geological risk alert on Thursday, October 30, 2025, valid until Monday, November 3, 2025, warning of potential landslides in the eastern and northeastern regions.

Downtown Los Angeles recorded 1.38 inches of rain on Tuesday, the highest single-day total since February and the largest October rainfall since 2009. Burbank saw 2.28 inches, shattering its previous October record of 0.25 inches set in 2009, while new daily rainfall records were also set in Camarillo, Santa Maria, and Lancaster. Evacuations were ordered near the burn scars of the Eaton Fire and Palisades Fire due to the risk of mudslides and flooding, as charred, vegetation-free soil increases runoff. No major mudslides had been reported by Wednesday morning. In the Sierra Nevada, snow blanketed the region, with Mammoth Mountain recording 10 inches; Interstate 80 near Donner Pass saw hazardous conditions, prompting the California Highway Patrol to issue warnings about slick roads and chain controls. Despite the storm\u2019s intensity, California remains in a rainfall deficit for 2025, with San Diego at 76% of its historical average and San Francisco at 67% of normal through October 14.

According to Marty Ralph, director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the storm acted as a 'Goldilocks atmospheric river'\u2014just right to provide beneficial moisture without causing flooding. The rainfall has delayed the fire season by weeks or even months by increasing soil and vegetation moisture, reducing flammability. This is especially significant after more than a year of severe drought, including January's hurricane-strength winds that fueled massive fires in Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and Altadena. While one storm cannot reverse long-term drought or eliminate fire risk, Ralph noted that it provides a favorable start to the water year. However, if the remainder of fall remains dry and Santa Ana winds return, vegetation could dry out again, reigniting fire concerns. As of mid-July 2025, California had already seen over 220,000 acres burned\u2014nearly 100,000 more than the five-year average\u2014driven by early fires and ongoing blazes, though no major fires have occurred in Southern California during the fall of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-15/rare-october-rains-could-push-back-la-fire-season)\n\n**Storm pounds LA area with rain, evacuations ordered  --  PHOTOS**\nA rare October storm brought heavy rainfall to Southern California on October 15, 2025, with up to 1.5 inches of rain recorded in most Los Angeles areas and over 5 inches in the San Gabriel Mountains. The storm triggered flash flood warnings in fire-scarred regions, where burned hillsides\u2014rendered impermeable like asphalt\u2014increased the risk of mudslides. Authorities evacuated approximately 115 homes in Pacific Palisades and Mandeville Canyon, areas devastated by a January fire that killed over 30 people and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. Firefighters rescued two people and two dogs from the swollen Los Angeles River; one man was hospitalized for exposure, and one woman declined medical transport. At least two tornado warnings were issued, rockslides were reported, and over 21,000 customers lost power. In Sierra Madre, debris flows trapped cars and damaged garages, while a section of the Pacific Coast Highway was submerged under at least 3 feet (1 meter) of sludge. A Los Angeles Fire Department vehicle was swept into the ocean. The storm followed a dry year, with much of Southern California under moderate to severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Climatologist Curtis Riganti noted the rain was welcome but its long-term drought impact remains uncertain. In the Sierra Nevada, up to 3 feet (1 meter) of snow was forecast, and in Tempe, Arizona, a microburst caused widespread damage, including uprooted trees, roof collapses, and power outages, rendering nine apartment buildings and several homes uninhabitable.

This amount equates to 408 liters of water falling on each square meter, equivalent to over four large household water tanks. The 30-year reference period used by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), from 1991 to 2020, shows that only four Septembers\u20141999, 2003, 2008, and 2020\u2014exceeded 350 mm. September 2009 was the driest. In 2025, rainfall in June surpassed the 1991\u20132020 average, exceeding 250 mm, but a severe drought occurred in July due to the 'can\u00edcula' (summer dry spell), with up to 25 days without rain in various regions, according to the National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (Insivumeh). Rainfall resumed in late August and intensified in September, exceeding the reference period by 150 mm. W\u00e1lter Arnoldo Bardales Espinosa, a meteorology expert at Agua Consulta, attributes the heavy rains to the passage of eastern waves and favorable atmospheric conditions, noting that while June and September are typically rainy months, June saw dry periods due to high-pressure systems. By September 23, soil saturation in Pet\u00e9n, Huehuetenango, Quich\u00e9, Alta Verapaz, Izabal, Zacapa, El Progreso, Chiquimula, and Jalapa reached or exceeded 90% in the upper layer, increasing landslide and collapse risks in mountainous areas. Agua Consulta forecasts continued heavy rains in October, with severe flooding reported in areas like the Anillo Perif\u00e9rico, Roosevelt Avenue, and Ra\u00fal Aguilar Batres Avenue, disrupting traffic. Insivumeh\u2019s C\u00e9sar George predicts the rainy season may end between October 15 and 25 but warns of possible national-scale precipitation systems. The Northern Transversal Strip and Caribbean regions will remain prone to rain. NOAA is monitoring a low-pressure system south of Mexico, which could develop into a tropical depression by week\u2019s end and trigger disordered rains and thunderstorms in central and southern Guatemala. Bardales warns that with about 25 days of rain already recorded since September, further damage from floods, landslides, and mudslides is likely. He attributes this to climate variability and suggests the season could extend into early November, as in 2020 when hurricanes Eta and Iota caused fatalities and disasters. Insivumeh\u2019s October outlook indicates neutral conditions, but there is a 60% chance of La Ni\u00f1a, a 39% chance of neutral conditions, and a 1% chance of El Ni\u00f1o. La Ni\u00f1a typically brings drier conditions in some areas and increased Atlantic hurricane activity. Cold fronts are expected to begin in late October, marking the start of the cold season, which may last until March or April in some regions, with up to 16 cold fronts forecasted, especially impacting the central highlands and western Guatemala.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:05 AM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/comunitario/septiembre-del-2025-ha-sido-el-mas-lluvioso-de-los-ultimos-30-anos-de-registros-mensuales/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts from a range of weather, climate, and geography disciplines overwhelmingly forecast a high likelihood that Burbank, California will receive measurable rain in November 2025. Their estimates ranged from 65% to 92% probability, with nearly all values clustered in the 70\u201390% range. \n\nKey reasoning among the experts includes:\n\n1. **Climatological Base Rate:** Nearly all forecasters cited historical data showing Burbank receives at least one day of measurable rain in November in 60\u201390%+ of past years, with most estimates at or above 70%. This strongly increases the probability.\n\n2. **Recent Weather and Pattern Shifts:** The city saw a record-breaking October rainstorm, demonstrating the atmosphere\u2019s capacity for delivering rain despite background drought or persistent high-pressure patterns. Experts noted this as either neutral or a slight positive factor for more rain in November.\n\n3. **Current Drought and Dry Streak:** Southern California remains under moderate drought, with a 17-day dry streak as of early November, and some models forecast persistent ridging\u2014factors cited as modestly decreasing or tempering rain probabilities.\n\n4. **Forecast Model Output and Outlooks:** All experts referenced medium- and long-range forecast models (GFS, ECMWF, NOAA/CPC 30-day outlooks), which indicate above-normal precipitation chances for California in November and hint at potential for storm tracks to dip further south later in the month. This factor increases the likelihood of at least a single rain event.\n\n5. **Atmospheric Patterns:** Regular mention was made of atmospheric rivers, the seasonal transition, and potential for troughs or cutoff lows to break through later in November\u2014all further enhancing probabilities for at least brief or light rain.\n\nThe key risk scenario presented by all is if a persistent ridge remains anchored over the West Coast, keeping the storm track north and leaving Burbank dry for the month\u2014a pattern not uncommon in strong drought or La Ni\u00f1a years, but not currently dominant according to models and outlooks. The consensus is that even a single weak or moderate system could tip the outcome to 'Yes,' and the base rate plus model guidance strongly favor rain.\n\nIn summary, despite some concerns about drought persistence and short-term dryness, all experts assign a high probability to Burbank receiving measurable rain in November 2025, mostly in the 70\u201390% range, anchored by strong climatological precedent and favorable model outlooks.",
