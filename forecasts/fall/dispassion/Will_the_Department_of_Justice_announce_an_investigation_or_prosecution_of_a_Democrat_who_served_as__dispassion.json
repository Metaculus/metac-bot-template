DOJ leadership has been reshaped to align with the president\u2019s stated priorities, and multiple sources confirm ongoing or imminent grand jury activity targeting qualifying Democrats. Although some cases may face legal difficulties or judicial rebuke, the question resolves on announcement, not conviction. Judicial and internal resistance could delay or limit overreach, but the administration\u2019s demonstrated willingness to announce cases with weak evidence suggests that at least one qualifying Democrat will be formally targeted before the deadline. Base rates for such actions are now less predictive than recent trend data, which shows a sharp uptick in politicized investigations.

Adam Schiff, who was an impeachment manager and is a sitting senator, is actively under investigation for mortgage fraud, with strong signals from DOJ officials and Trump\u2019s own communications that an indictment is being pursued. Multiple mainstream reports specify DOJ press releases and official statements (e.g., CNN, The Hill, NBC) and detail grand jury indictments, U.S. Attorney appointments, and scheduled federal trials. While some judicial and institutional resistance exists, the public and formal nature of the actions, coupled with the low bar for resolution (any announced investigation or prosecution), makes a \u2018Yes\u2019 outcome almost certain. The only reason for non-extreme certainty is the slim possibility that the reported actions do not fully meet Metaculus\u2019s stringent resolution criteria, or there is some technicality (e.g., prosecution is state-based, not federal, or the DOJ later walks back the announcement).

Multiple news reports indicate that political considerations and loyalty now play a dominant role in DOJ decision-making, with the Trump administration publicly demanding and then receiving DOJ action against named political foes. Judicial and internal DOJ resistance is evident but has not stopped previous announcements from being made. The question asks not about convictions but about public announcements, which have already occurred in at least two high-profile cases, and ongoing probes could yield additional announcements within the remaining seven weeks. Given that the Metaculus resolution criteria only require a credible, public DOJ announcement (not a conviction or final outcome), and the pattern of behavior established, the probability is very high that at least one qualifying announcement will occur before the deadline (and arguably already has).

The procedural distinction between state and federal action has been settled by multiple credible sources confirming these are DOJ-led, federally announced actions. Forecasters specializing in DOJ protocol and federal indictment standards have convincingly argued that, once announced, such actions are almost never rescinded in a manner that would negate public record or Metaculus resolution. Historical base rates are no longer reliable due to the ongoing breakdown of institutional norms and the demonstrated pattern of retributive DOJ action.

Several forecasts highlight that federal indictments and public DOJ announcements against qualifying Democrats (e.g., Letitia James) have been widely reported in credible sources, and the procedural reality is that such announcements are almost never rescinded in a way that would negate resolution. Minor reservations about technicalities (such as federal vs. state action or last-minute reversals) are consistently discounted as not credible in the current context.

Multiple forecasters addressed and discounted the technical risk of a state versus federal distinction or a retroactive rescission, noting that DOJ protocol and the public record make such reversals extremely rare.

The report highlights that federal prosecutor Jason A. Reding Qui\u00f1ones in the Southern District of Florida is expanding an investigation into a purported 'grand conspiracy' against Trump, issuing over two dozen subpoenas\u2014including to former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former FBI agent Peter Strzok. The prosecution's central narrative\u2014that 'deep state' Democrats conspired to undermine Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and presidency\u2014remains 'unsupported by the evidence,' according to the NYT. The report concludes that while it is unclear whether the subpoenas will result in charges or convictions, the mere act of naming and shaming political foes serves as a symbolic victory for Trump\u2019s base, who view such actions as a legitimate function of law enforcement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 02:05 AM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-2674280080/)\n\n**How an Adam Schiff indictment could shake the Senate**\nSen.

President Trump has publicly urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue Schiff, following previous indictments of James Comey and Letitia James, marking a significant escalation in Trump\u2019s campaign against political adversaries. The investigation remains ongoing, with reports suggesting prosecutors face difficulties gathering sufficient evidence. Schiff has launched a legal defense fund and is supported by a $8.6 million campaign war chest, with legal representation from WilmerHale and former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. Democrats are deeply concerned, fearing a precedent that could lead to widespread targeting of elected officials, while many Republicans remain silent or express discomfort. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) warned that the weaponization of the DOJ undermines the rule of law, and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) criticized the lack of Republican opposition. Some Republicans, like Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), openly support targeting Schiff, accusing him of misconduct during the first impeachment. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) noted the case appears difficult to win, while the DOJ declined to comment.

Volume II, detailing the classified documents case, remains under a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed judge known for delaying proceedings against him.

What are they hiding? | Opinion**\nRepublican lawmakers in Congress, including U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan and Sen. Chuck Grassley, have requested private testimony from special counsel Jack Smith regarding his investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s conduct after the 2020 election, particularly concerning the hoarding of classified documents. Smith, through his legal team, has expressed willingness to testify but insists on an open hearing rather than a closed-door session, citing the need for guidance from the Department of Justice on disclosing federal grand jury information, including Volume II of his report. This volume, which details the classified documents case, remains under a gag order imposed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee with a history of delaying proceedings against him. A three-judge panel from the 11th Circuit has ordered Cannon to act within 60 days on requests to lift the gag order, criticizing her for 'undue delay.' If Cannon delays until January, the case could be appealed to the 11th Circuit, and Trump may appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Democrats and advocacy groups like American Oversight and the Knight First Amendment Institute are pushing for transparency, arguing that public testimony could accelerate the release of Volume II. The author contends that Republicans\u2019 demand for private hearings raises questions about what they might be hiding, especially since they claim to seek justice. The situation could extend into the 2026 midterm elections, with Trump likely opposing any public scrutiny that undermines his efforts to rewrite his post-2020 narrative.

The motion claims the indictment violates the Fifth Amendment, citing Trump\u2019s repeated derogatory remarks\u2014such as calling her 'SCUM,' 'a Complete and Total Disaster,' 'racist,' 'weak,' and 'a monster'\u2014as evidence of unconstitutional targeting. James\u2019s attorneys assert that the charges were triggered by her 2022 civil fraud investigation into Trump\u2019s business empire, which resulted in a $354.8 million penalty (over $500 million with interest) before being overturned on appeal. The motion characterizes the DOJ\u2019s actions as 'invidious and in bad faith,' alleging the department is 'too tainted with unconstitutional motivation' to prosecute fairly. James pleaded not guilty to bank fraud and making false statements related to her Virginia home mortgage, where she allegedly misrepresented her intent to use the property as a secondary residence, saving nearly $19,000. She has repeatedly denounced the charges as 'baseless' and part of a 'weaponizing of justice for political gain,' vowing to 'not bow, not break, not bend' at a rally for a mayoral candidate. The trial is scheduled for January 26, 2026. Alongside James, the DOJ indicted other perceived political opponents, including former FBI Director James Comey and former national security adviser John Bolton, who also pleaded not guilty. Trump denied the charges were politically motivated, claiming he was 'mild-mannered' and that the indictments were necessary to protect his ability to run for president, stating, 'Otherwise, I couldn't have run for president.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 03:01 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5596447-letitia-james-motion-to-dismiss-mortage-fraud-charges-trump-admin/)\n\n**How an Adam Schiff indictment could shake the Senate**\nSen.

The probe, led by Jason Reding Qui\u00f1ones, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and a close associate of Attorney General Pam Bondi, targets former top officials from the Obama administration, including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former CIA Director John Brennan. The subpoenas seek documents related to the 2016 Russia investigation, which began under President Barack Obama. The probe may extend beyond those involved in the original Russia inquiry to include Biden administration officials who investigated Donald Trump for mishandling classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Former FBI Director James Comey, indicted on unrelated charges in September 2024 following Trump\u2019s demands, is also under scrutiny, with his defense team preparing for potential inclusion. Trump has publicly called for prosecutions of figures including Adam Schiff, Jack Smith, Merrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, and Chris Wray, accusing them of a 'corrupt J-6 Witch Hunt.' Critics, including Democrats and former intelligence officials, argue the investigation is politically motivated and baseless, citing multiple bipartisan reviews\u2014such as the Senate Intelligence Committee\u2019s 2019 report\u2014that confirmed Russian interference in 2016, though no conclusive evidence of campaign collusion was found. The DOJ has not commented. The Miami-based investigation is reportedly recruiting prosecutors and restructuring its national security unit, with a grand jury expected to convene in Fort Pierce, Florida, to avoid perceived Democratic bias in Washington, D.C. Republican lawmakers and Trump allies claim a 'treasonous conspiracy' by Obama and Biden officials, citing alleged politicization of intelligence, including the use of the Steele dossier. However, the DOJ\u2019s own special counsel John Durham found no criminal wrongdoing in the original investigation. The probe marks Trump\u2019s most ambitious effort to weaponize federal law enforcement against perceived political adversaries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 01:41 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/doj-prepares-subpoenas-sweeping-criminal-014139441.html)\n\n**If Arctic Frost Perpetrators Don't Go To Jail, Conservatives Will**\nThe article claims that the Biden Administration's 'Arctic Frost' operation, led by Attorney General Merrick Garland and Special Counsel Jack Smith, was a partisan, illegal effort to surveil and prosecute the Republican Party under the guise of investigating January 6th. According to the article, Smith secretly surveilled at least eight Republican senators without probable cause, issued 197 subpoenas to 430 individuals and organizations\u2014many unrelated to January 6th or even non-existent at the time\u2014and demanded access to private donor data, banking records, and media contacts. The subpoenas were accompanied by gag orders preventing phone companies from informing senators, a move alleged to be a federal crime. Despite spending millions in legal fees, the investigation yielded no evidence of wrongdoing. The article argues that if Donald Trump had not won the 2024 election, the operation would have continued, potentially leading to indictments, de-banking, and arrests of conservative figures under a future Democratic administration. It asserts that the perpetrators\u2014DOJ prosecutors, FBI agents, and judges\u2014remain in their positions and are emboldened, not deterred, by past actions. The article calls on Republicans to respond with severe legal consequences: congressional hearings, disbarment, impeachment, prosecution, imprisonment, and pension forfeiture for those involved in Arctic Frost. It frames this not as revenge, but as necessary justice to deter future abuses of power by Democratic elites, warning that without such action, the Republican Party risks existential threat. The article concludes that the only remaining restraint on Democrat power is fear, and that Republicans must enforce the rule of law to restore balance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 12:17 PM\nSource:[The Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2025/11/06/if-arctic-frost-perpetrators-dont-go-to-jail-conservatives-will/)\n\n**Judge Questions Justice Department\u2019s Approach in Comey Prosecution**\nFederal magistrate judge William Fitzpatrick of the Eastern District of Virginia issued a rare public warning to the Justice Department (DOJ) on November 5, 2025, suggesting that prosecutors in the criminal case against former FBI Director James Comey may have mishandled evidence and prioritized indictment over thorough investigation. During a brief hearing, Fitzpatrick stated, 'Right now, we are in a bit of a feeling of indict first, investigate later,' marking an unusual judicial rebuke of DOJ procedures. The remark underscores internal concerns within the DOJ, with multiple career prosecutors reportedly questioning the case\u2019s merit and timing. Critics allege the prosecution is politically motivated, targeting Comey\u2014whose 2017 dismissal by former President Donald Trump sparked obstruction allegations\u2014during a sensitive period in U.S. politics. The Eastern District of Virginia, a common venue for national security cases due to its proximity to Washington, D.C., has drawn defense scrutiny over potential jury bias. Legal experts note that such judicial warnings often precede serious consequences, including evidence exclusion or dismissal of charges. The DOJ has not yet publicly responded to the judge\u2019s concerns. The defense may now file motions challenging the adequacy of the pre-indictment investigation, potentially delaying trial proceedings. The case raises broader questions about judicial oversight and prosecutorial accountability in high-profile, politically charged prosecutions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[The Dupree Report](https://www.thedupreereport.com/2025/11/judge-warns-doj-comey/)\n\n**Judge scolds Comey prosecutors, orders records to be produced**\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered prosecutors to provide grand jury records and evidence from the investigation into former FBI Director James Comey by the end of Thursday, November 6, 2025, criticizing the Department of Justice (DOJ) for 'indict first and investigate later.' Comey, who was present at the hearing but did not speak, and his lawyers stated they had not seen the materials, prompting the judge to declare, 'We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today.' The materials include communications between Comey and Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman, a special government employee at the FBI, seized in 2019 and 2020. Prosecutors allege Comey encouraged Richman to speak with reporters and lied to Congress about authorizing anonymous sources. Comey pleaded not guilty last month to charges related to false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020, where he claimed he did not authorize a media leak about the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton and the Trump-Russia probe. The DOJ defended President Trump's social media posts calling for Comey's prosecution, asserting they were not retaliatory, while Comey's lawyers argued the case is politically motivated and a departure from the DOJ's traditional ethical standards. Trump had used Truth Social to call for the prosecution of Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former national security advisor John Bolton, all of whom have since been indicted. Comey's legal team emphasized that the DOJ has historically followed only facts and law, and this case represents a sharp break from that tradition.

According to the book, Garland\u2019s decision-making was marked by excessive caution, a desire to avoid setting legal precedents, and a freeze on both cases before the 2022 midterms\u2014even though Trump was not on the ballot and had not yet declared his 2024 candidacy. Dilanian reports that these delays, driven by a 'conservative interpretation' of DOJ policies, may have hampered federal criminal investigations. While Dilanian acknowledges that Garland\u2019s critics on the right were wrong to claim the Justice Department was weaponized against Trump, he argues that Garland\u2019s actions were still problematic, as they prioritized the appearance of impartiality and political optics over justice. The author of the article contends that Garland\u2019s choices were influenced by fear of backlash from rightwing media and political pressure, even if no direct White House interference occurred. The delays allowed the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down Colorado\u2019s decision to bar Trump from the ballot under the 14th Amendment, effectively removing a legal check on Trump before the 2024 election. The article warns that this precedent enables powerful figures to act with impunity, and argues that Dilanian\u2019s portrayal of Garland as having done 'things right' is misleading\u2014it reflects a political bias that downplays Garland\u2019s failure to prioritize justice over image. The piece concludes that future accountability efforts must learn from Garland\u2019s mistakes and that systemic reforms\u2014such as abolishing ICE or expanding the Supreme Court\u2014are necessary to prevent future democratic erosion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 03:00 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/alternet-exclusives/criticism-of-merrick-garland/)\n\n**DOJ defends Trump Truth Social post as Comey seeks to have case dismissed**\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) defended the federal case against former FBI Director James Comey in a 48-page filing, urging a court to reject his motion to dismiss the indictment. Comey, indicted in late September on charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation, pleaded not guilty. His legal team argued that the prosecution was vindictive and selective, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s September Truth Social post calling for the prosecution of political adversaries\u2014including Comey, Sen. Adam Schiff, and New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2014as evidence of political bias. The DOJ countered that Trump\u2019s post reflected his personal views on the need for prosecution but did not constitute direct evidence of a vindictive motive. Prosecutors emphasized that the decision to prosecute was made by DOJ officials, not the President, and that there was no direct admission of discriminatory intent. They dismissed Comey\u2019s claims as requiring 'leaps of logic and a big dose of cynicism.' Additionally, Comey\u2019s team challenged the validity of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan\u2019s appointment, arguing it was unconstitutional and unlawful, since she was Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and replaced Erik Siebert, who resigned under pressure to indict Comey and James. The DOJ maintained that Halligan\u2019s appointment complied with federal law and the Constitution\u2019s Appointments Clause. The case has sparked intense political reactions nationwide.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 01:18 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-defends-trump-truth-social-post-comey-seeks-have-case-dismissed)\n\n**Justice Department defends Trump's post as it urges judge to reject Comey's effort to dismiss case**\nThe U.S. Justice Department urged a federal judge to reject James Comey\u2019s claim that his prosecution is politically motivated retribution, arguing that Comey has failed to provide direct evidence of a vindictive motive by President Donald Trump. Prosecutors defended Trump\u2019s September 2020 social media post calling for action against Comey, stating it reflects a 'legitimate prosecutorial motive' rather than political spite. They emphasized that the decision to prosecute was made by DOJ officials, not the president, and dismissed Comey\u2019s argument as requiring 'leaps of logic and a big dose of cynicism.' The case centers on Comey\u2019s indictment for allegedly lying to Congress on September 30, 2020, regarding whether he authorized FBI leaks to the media about investigations involving Trump and Hillary Clinton. Prosecutors cited communications between Comey and Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor, to support the claim that Comey encouraged media disclosures. Comey\u2019s defense argues the Senate questions from Senator Ted Cruz were vague and ambiguous, specifically referencing Andrew McCabe, not Richman, making it impossible for Comey to have intended to lie. Additionally, Comey\u2019s lawyers are challenging the appointment of Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide with no prior federal prosecution experience, as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after Erik Siebert\u2019s resignation under administration pressure. The defense has also requested access to grand jury transcripts and audio recordings, alleging factual and legal errors may have influenced the indictment. The case is one of several high-profile challenges to the prosecution, with New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019s legal team signaling it may make a similar argument.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 11:11 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-james-comey-donald-trump-107b753d133f756a469ee65f48aa9e17)\n\n**New documents expose Biden DOJ's 'fishing expedition' into Trump, Republicans during 2024 race**\nNew whistleblower documents released on October 29, 2025, reveal that the Biden Justice Department, under Special Prosecutor Jack Smith, launched a broad investigative operation codenamed 'Arctic Frost' targeting the Republican Party shortly after Donald Trump announced his 2024 presidential campaign in November 2022. The operation issued 197 subpoenas to over 430 individuals and organizations, including high-profile figures such as Stephen Miller, Dan Scavino, Jared Kushner, and Lara Trump, as well as banks, media outlets like CBS and Fox News, and 11 members of Congress whose phone records were secretly subpoenaed. One subpoena to AT&T for Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s cell phone records was denied due to constitutional protections, but the company was silenced by a secret court order from Judge James Boasberg, who cited risks of evidence tampering and witness intimidation. Cruz publicly waived the gag order and denounced the order as a weaponization of the judiciary, calling for Boasberg\u2019s impeachment. Republican senators, including Charles E. Grassley and Lindsey Graham, condemned the probe as a 'fishing expedition' and an abuse of power, arguing it was politically motivated and targeted Republicans solely because of Trump\u2019s campaign. Graham claimed the investigation was a 'Democratic machine' effort to derail Trump\u2019s political comeback. Smith, who indicted Trump on August 1, 2023, for election interference related to the 2020 election, maintains his decision was justified, stating Trump made 'knowingly false claims of election fraud' and that he would have been convicted had Trump not won re-election. The indictment was dismissed after Trump\u2019s 2024 victory. The House has demanded full disclosure of Arctic Frost documents before considering Smith\u2019s testimony, and Republicans are urging further whistleblowers to come forward.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/29/new-documents-expose-biden-dojs-fishing-expedition-trump-republicans/)\n\n**Democrats Must Be Punished for Their Lawfare**\nThe article claims that the Democratic Party systematically engages in 'lawfare'\u2014using the legal system to target political opponents, particularly Donald Trump and his associates. It asserts that since Trump became a Republican candidate, he faced a series of 'meritless' investigations, prosecutions, and civil suits orchestrated by Democratic officials, including FBI agents, DOJ attorneys, and judges. Specific allegations include the framing of Trump as a Russian spy, the use of warrantless raids on his residence, rewriting civil statutes to target him, and attempting to imprison him for lawful actions such as pursuing remedies to the 2020 election results, possessing exculpatory documents, and allegedly engaging in 'insurrection.' The article claims that Trump\u2019s associates\u2014including Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos, Rudy Giuliani, Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Steve Bannon, and Peter Navarro\u2014were targeted, harassed, arrested, or prosecuted. It further alleges that thousands of ordinary Trump supporters were similarly victimized. The piece contrasts this treatment with the leniency shown to left-wing rioters during the 2020 protests, which it labels as 'domestic terrorism' but were celebrated by Democrats as the 'Summer of Love.' It criticizes Democratic hypocrisy, citing examples such as the IRS targeting conservative nonprofits under Obama, FEMA ignoring Trump-supporters during hurricanes under Biden, and prosecutors failing to act against violent attacks on religious and pro-life institutions. The article accuses prominent Democrats\u2014including J.B. Pritzker, Mark Kelly, Eric Swalwell, and James Carville\u2014of inciting violence, calling for the persecution of Trump supporters, and threatening future retribution. It concludes that Democrats must be held accountable for their alleged abuses of power before they can carry out further punitive actions against conservatives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 11:04 AM\nSource:[American Thinker](https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/10/democrats_must_be_punished_for_their_lawfare.html)\n\n**Seeking justice or serving revenge?

Among Democrats, 85% agreed with this view, compared to only 29% of Republicans. The poll, which included 4,385 U.S. adults, was released amid heightened political tensions following Trump\u2019s September 20 post on Truth Social urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Senator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), stating, 'Justice must be served, now!!!' Bondi denied that the DOJ's investigations are politically motivated during a Senate Judiciary Committee appearance on October 7, asserting that Trump has been transparent. Vice President JD Vance echoed this, claiming the prosecutions are 'driven by law and not by politics.' A Quinnipiac poll released October 22 showed 83% of Republicans believe the charges against Trump\u2019s opponents are justified, while 92% of Democrats deemed them unjustified. University of Kansas sociologist David N. Smith told the Associated Press that 'weaponizing the state to win the culture war has been essential' to Trump\u2019s agenda, noting that while Trump\u2019s supporters opposed state action when it targeted Trump, they now support it when it targets their political adversaries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 10:08 AM\nSource:[NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/10/seeking-justice-or-serving-revenge-americans-divided-over-trump-doj-prosecutions-poll.html)\n\n**Adam Schiff Says 'We Will Not Be Intimidated' Amid Trump's Alleged Retaliation Campaign Against Political Foes**\nSenator Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) declared on October 12, 2025, in a video posted on X, that he and other political figures will not be intimidated by President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged campaign of legal retaliation against perceived enemies. Schiff emphasized that Trump\u2019s 'long and growing' list of opponents includes not only Democrats but also Republicans, citing recent indictments of high-profile figures such as New York Attorney General Letitia James on mortgage fraud charges and former FBI Director James Comey on counts related to congressional testimony in 2020. Trump had previously labeled Schiff, James, and Comey as 'all guilty as hell' in a Truth Social post. Schiff, who led the first impeachment inquiry into Trump in 2019 and served on the Jan. 6 House Select Committee, is reportedly under investigation for mortgage fraud in Maryland. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton is also reportedly facing potential criminal charges. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the use of the Department of Justice as a tool for political retribution, calling it 'outrageous.' Republican Rep. Don Bacon echoed this concern, stating that Trump\u2019s public calls for indictments were 'unseemly' and 'foolish,' noting that such actions are not typical for a U.S. president.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 04:38 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/politics/25/10/48166336/adam-schiff-says-we-will-not-be-intimidated-amid-trumps-alleged-retaliation-campaign-against-political-foes)\n\n**Democrats Are Promising to Weaponize the Government Against Trump and His Allies**\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Representative Eric Swalwell have openly stated that if Democrats regain control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections, they will pursue accountability against Donald Trump and his allies through government institutions, including the Department of Justice. Jeffries cited Trump\u2019s alleged corruption and the Supreme Court\u2019s five-year blanket immunity ruling for Trump as justification, emphasizing that 'there will be accountability with the next administration, if not before.' Swalwell echoed this, declaring 'Accountability is coming' and framing the strategy as a deliberate use of government power to target political opponents. The article argues these statements represent a shift from oversight to intimidation, warning that Democrats\u2019 planned use of investigations and prosecutions would constitute a 'banana republic' model where political dissent is punished. The piece references past actions under the Biden administration, such as targeting conservative groups and media outlets, as a precedent. It concludes with a warning that this trajectory threatens the rule of law and American democracy, calling for public resistance to prevent a future of vengeance-driven governance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 06:08 PM\nSource:[PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/10/10/democrats-are-promising-to-weaponize-the-government-against-trump-and-his-allies-n4944717)\n\n**Trump accidentally posted his message pressuring Pam Bondi to charge his enemies, source says**\nAccording to a Trump administration official, President Donald Trump intended a September 20, 2025, post on Truth Social urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political opponents as a private message, not a public post. Trump was surprised to learn he had published it publicly, reacting with 'oh' and attempting to downplay it. The post, addressed to Bondi as 'Pam,' expressed frustration that 'nothing is being done' against figures including former FBI Director James Comey, Senator Adam Schiff, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, whom Trump labeled 'guilty as hell.' He claimed that the lack of action was damaging national credibility and demanded 'JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!' Two of the three individuals mentioned\u2014Comey and James\u2014were subsequently indicted: James on bank fraud and false statements charges by a federal grand jury, and Comey on false statements to Congress and obstruction. Two administration officials confirmed Bondi had appointed a 'special attorney' to investigate mortgage fraud allegations against James and Schiff. Legal experts and critics have raised concerns about the use of the Justice Department for political retribution, with James' attorney, Abbe Lowell, stating the case is 'driven by President Trump's desire for revenge' and constituting a 'serious attack on the rule of law.' Trump previously claimed he had no involvement in the investigations, despite publicly pressuring Bondi. Schiff, who was lead impeachment manager in Trump\u2019s first impeachment, called the targeting of political enemies 'a threat to our democracy' and stated he and others on Trump\u2019s 'enemies list' would not be intimidated. The administration has also purged Justice Department and FBI officials, including those involved in Jack Smith\u2019s investigations, prompting a letter from 42 retired judges warning that American rights and liberties are 'in grave danger' due to Trump's 'corruptly' abusing his office to target critics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 02:03 PM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-accidentally-posted-message-pressuring-pam-bondi-charge-enemies-rcna236830)\n\n**Analysis: Trump never forgets: Bombshell indictments open a new phase in a retribution presidency | CNN Politics**\nOn October 10, 2025, Donald Trump was involved in a series of high-profile indictments targeting political adversaries, including New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey, marking a pivotal phase in what CNN describes as a 'retribution presidency.' James was indicted on two felony charges\u2014bank fraud and making false statements\u2014related to a mortgage for her Virginia home, while Comey faced charges of providing false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding. Both cases were prosecuted by Lindsey Halligan, Trump\u2019s former personal attorney and newly appointed U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, following the resignation of Erik Siebert, who reportedly found insufficient evidence to support charges. The indictments come amid a broader pattern of political retribution: Trump previously demanded charges against James via a Truth Social post to Attorney General Pam Bondi, referencing her, Comey, and Senator Adam Schiff, stating, 'They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!' Critics, including NYU law professor Ryan Goodman, question the legitimacy of the cases, calling them 'deeply suspect' and politically motivated. James dismissed the charges as 'baseless' and 'a continuation of the president's desperate weaponization of our justice system.' The article highlights concerns about the erosion of the rule of law, citing Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops from Texas to Illinois and attempts to mobilize reservists from California\u2014actions blocked by courts. Republican Senator Elissa Slotkin warned that the president using the Justice Department to target opponents threatens democratic institutions. While Trump\u2019s supporters, like Rep. Elise Stefanik, claim James engaged in a 'political witch hunt,' the article argues that the pattern of retaliatory indictments reflects a dangerous precedent, with Senator Thom Tillis noting that 'whatever threshold gets set here is the new floor for future prosecutions.' Trump, who has long claimed he was victimized by politically driven investigations, now appears to be weaponizing the justice system in response, despite previously denying wrongdoing in multiple cases, including those related to election interference and classified documents. The article concludes that while Trump claims he would not pursue such actions, his rhetoric and actions suggest a calculated strategy of retribution, raising concerns about the future of American democracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 04:27 AM\nSource:[CNN](https://us.cnn.com/2025/10/10/politics/letitia-james-trump-indicted-comey-justice-department-analysis)\n\n**White House admits Trump's message to Bondi to prosecute enemies was supposed to be a DM: report**\nA September 20, 2025, post by Donald Trump on Truth Social, addressed to Attorney General Pam Bondi and urging immediate prosecution of his perceived political enemies\u2014including former FBI Director James Comey\u2014was intended as a private direct message (DM), according to White House officials. Trump believed he had sent the message directly to Bondi, but it was publicly posted, prompting surprise and backlash. The post, which accused Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and Senator Adam Schiff of being 'all guilty as hell' and demanded 'justice be served' after Trump's 'impeachments and indictments,' was later followed by a corrective message praising Bondi's work. The incident highlights a significant shift in the Department of Justice, now reportedly stripped of independence under Trump and Bondi. Comey, who pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress and obstruction, faces a trial tentatively scheduled for January 5, 2026, with his attorneys planning to challenge the case on grounds of Trump's 'vindictive' prosecution. The post is expected to be central to that motion, demonstrating presidential direction to prosecute a target labeled 'guilty' before charges were filed. The administration has removed dozens of officials deemed disloyal, including Erik Siebert, the former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, whom Trump fired for refusing to pursue Comey. Trump then nominated Lindsey Halligan, a lawyer with no prosecutorial experience, to replace him. Halligan, in a rare move, personally presented the case to a grand jury, which indicted Comey on two counts\u2014false statements to Congress and obstruction\u2014after only 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor. Internal prosecutors had previously cited difficulties due to a key witness, Columbia law professor Daniel Richmond, whose testimony would create 'likely insurmountable problems' for the case. Bondi, during her January confirmation hearing, pledged to end the 'weaponization' of the Justice Department, echoing Trump\u2019s claims that his indictments were politically motivated. When questioned again in a Senate hearing, she refused to confirm whether she received White House instructions. The administration is also targeting other Democratic figures and progressive groups, including former national security adviser John Bolton, whose home was raided in August and who may face charges in Maryland. Former FBI Director Christopher Wray is also under investigation, though the focus remains unclear.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 03:59 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/white-house-admits-trump-message-155951217.html)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Retaliation Campaign Sets a Precedent That Could Backfire on His Allies**\nThe article examines the political and institutional consequences of Donald Trump's campaign to pursue his political enemies, particularly focusing on the imputation of former FBI Director James B. Comey, requested by Trump. This action has raised concerns among allies and experts about the precedent it sets for future governments. The piece highlights that Trump's efforts to use government power to retaliate against opponents\u2014through firings, investigations, and pressure on agencies like the FCC\u2014undermine long-standing norms of political neutrality and institutional independence. Critics, including former White House officials, conservative scholars, and nonpartisan watchdogs like Bright Line Watch, warn that such actions could lead to a cycle of retaliation, where each new administration targets its predecessor. The article notes that support among Democrats for restricting or shutting down Fox News has increased from 37% in 2021 to 50% in 2025, suggesting a growing appetite for political retribution. While Trump claims Democrats previously abused power\u2014citing four criminal charges against him post-2021\u2014his actions are seen as more overtly personal and politically driven. Unlike Biden, who relied on independent special prosecutors, Trump has directly pressured the DOJ and FBI to target critics, revoked security clearances, and dismissed career officials. Experts like Ruth Ben-Ghiat warn this reflects a 'personalist' authoritarian model, where institutions serve the leader\u2019s vendettas. Even Kash Patel, the current FBI director, faces scrutiny for breaking his promise of non-politicization. The article concludes that while Trump frames his actions as accountability, they risk normalizing political persecution and eroding democratic checks and balances, potentially endangering future conservative leaders if Democrats gain power.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 05:59 PM\nSource:[Vanguardia](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/internacional/al-perseguir-a-sus-enemigos-trump-sienta-un-precedente-que-podria-afectar-a-sus-aliados-IA17538189)\n\n**Trump ramps up retribution campaign against his political enemies**\nThe article reports that President Donald Trump has intensified his campaign to prosecute political opponents, urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to pursue cases against figures such as New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey.

He added that he had \u2018reviewed over 30 statements and posts\u2019 that he claims criticize his administration\u2019s lack of action.  Trump later praised Bondi, writing that she was \u2018doing a GREAT job.\u2019\n\nThe piece also documents criticism from Republican Senator Rand Paul, who said it is \u2018not right for the Trump administration to do the same thing,\u2019 and from Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who called the president\u2019s direction of the DOJ \u2018unconstitutional and deeply immoral\u2019 and warned it could set a dangerous precedent.  Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer described the DOJ as being turned into an instrument that \u201cgoes after his enemies, whether they\u2019re guilty or not.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s administration has also filled key legal positions with loyalists, naming former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro and former attorney Alina Habba as U.S. attorneys in Washington, D.C. and New Jersey, respectively, and appointing Lindsey Halligan as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia after the resignation of Erik Siebert.\n\nIn addition to legal moves, the article notes Trump\u2019s new Pentagon memo that requires credentialed journalists to sign a pledge not to report unapproved information, and his praise of ABC\u2019s suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, calling it a courageous decision.  The FCC\u2019s chairman, Brendan Carr, condemned Kimmel\u2019s comments as \u2018truly sick,\u2019 while Republican Senator Ted Cruz warned that threatening to silence speech is dangerous.\n\nOverall, the article portrays Trump\u2019s actions as a concerted effort to use the Justice Department and other federal agencies to target political adversaries, drawing sharp criticism from both parties for potentially eroding democratic norms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 12:58 AM\nSource:[CDN Digital](https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/658585/trump-ramps-up-retribution-campaign-against-his-political-enemies)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, there is a broad consensus that the probability the Department of Justice (DOJ) will have announced an investigation or prosecution of a high-profile Democrat (as defined by the question) before January 1, 2026 is extremely high. Nearly every forecaster points to concrete, credible news reports confirming that DOJ has already officially announced indictments or investigations against individuals meeting the criteria\u2014most frequently cited are Letitia James (an impeachment manager) and Adam Schiff (impeachment manager and senator), with frequent mention of James Comey (although Comey's eligibility under the question is debated) and ongoing/investigated cases for others on the list. Experts agree that the Trump administration's explicit political pressure, appointments of loyalists to the DOJ and U.S. Attorney offices, and erosion of traditional prosecutorial norms have shattered the previous status quo, which saw such actions as exceedingly rare if not unprecedented. Although some resistance remains from federal judges and career DOJ officials\u2014potentially delaying or undermining the merits of prosecutions\u2014these factors are assessed as insufficient to prevent public DOJ announcements, particularly given that only an official, public announcement (not a conviction) is necessary for question resolution. Several experts note that the required threshold for a 'Yes' resolution has likely been met already. Probabilities assigned range from the low 90s to 99%, with nearly all forecasted probabilities above 93%. The scenarios that could yield a 'No' outcome (such as sudden widespread judicial reversal, procedural collapse, or rescinding of all announcements) are considered highly improbable. In summary, the expert consensus is that a 'Yes' resolution is nearly certain, based both on observed DOJ announcements fitting Metaculus criteria and the ongoing trend toward further such actions before the deadline.",
