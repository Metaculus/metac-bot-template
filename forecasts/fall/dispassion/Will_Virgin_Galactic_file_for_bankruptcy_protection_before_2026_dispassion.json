My original probability of 5% sits slightly above the median group estimate but within the justified range, mainly to capture low-probability black swan events. Given no new risk signals and the consensus that the base rate for bankruptcy in this interval is extremely low, I will modestly lower my probability to align even more closely with the evidence and base rates.",

The company has a market capitalization of just $190.63 million and a 'Weak' overall financial health score according to InvestingPro. Virgin Galactic's stock has declined by over 40% year-to-date, significantly underperforming the S&P 500's 15% gain, making it the worst performer in Wolfe Research's coverage universe. The company remains in a 'pre-revenue' phase, facing high costs and substantial cash burn\u2014projected at over $400 million in 2025 and an additional $250 million in 2026. InvestingPro data shows minimal revenues of only $1.7 million over the past 12 months, with a staggering gross profit margin of -4,327%. While Wolfe Research acknowledges a potential path to profitability once consistent space flights begin, risks persist regarding the production of new spacecraft, warranting a conservative valuation approach. Despite a slight undervaluation indication from InvestingPro, analysts forecast a diluted EPS of -$5.15 for fiscal 2025, reinforcing concerns about profitability. Looking ahead to 2027, Wolfe Research projects approximately $60 million in EBITDA, applying a 10x multiple, but with net debt exceeding $350 million by end-2026, limiting upside potential from current levels. The current EBITDA is -$305.17 million, and analyst price targets range from $2 to $8, reflecting significant uncertainty. Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. recently reported third-quarter 2025 earnings showing declining revenues, underscoring ongoing challenges in achieving profitability. The company continues to face hurdles in the emerging space tourism market as it prepares for commercial service launches. Investors are closely monitoring its strategic direction and operational efficiency. Despite setbacks, Virgin Galactic remains focused on its next commercial service launch, with its efforts in the space tourism industry continuing to draw interest from sector observers and investors.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 11:44 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Italia](https://it.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/le-azioni-di-virgin-galactic-affrontano-rischi-elevati-wolfe-research-mantiene-il-rating-93CH-3097830)\n\n**Virgin Galactic (SPCE) Advances Toward 2026 Spaceflight Goals**\nVirgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE) is advancing toward operational readiness for its SpaceShip program by 2026, with CEO Michael Colglazier confirming a stable timeline: flight tests are scheduled for Q3 2026 and the first spaceflight in Q4 2026.

As of September 30, 2025, cash reserves stood at $424 million, bolstered by a $23 million equity offering. The company continues to focus on spacecraft fleet development, with detailed progress shown in components such as wings, feathering systems, fuselage, and oxidizer tanks. Virgin Galactic projects that an initial fleet of two spacecraft and one launch aircraft could generate $450 million in annual revenue and $90 million to $115 million in adjusted EBITDA through 125 flights carrying 750 passengers. An expanded fleet of four spacecraft and two launch aircraft could potentially generate $990 million in annual revenue and $450 million to $500 million in adjusted EBITDA through 275 flights carrying 1,650 passengers. The company maintains its target for commercial operations in Q4 2026, with most current customers expected to fly by 2027. Management remains confident in achieving key milestones, but investors remain cautious about the extended timeline and ongoing capital requirements. Market reaction indicates that while visible development progress is recognized, investor confidence in a clear path to profitability remains limited.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 11:28 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/company-news/article-93CH-1324460)\n\n**Virgin Galactic T3 2025: Spacecraft Progress Continues Amid Minimal Revenue**\nVirgin Galactic Holdings Inc (NYSE:SPCE) reported third-quarter 2025 financial results on November 13, 2025, highlighting progress in spacecraft manufacturing despite minimal revenue.

Virgin Galactic announced an updated timeline when it reported quarterly financial results, which fell short of analysts' expectations. Revenue was about US$410,000 for the second quarter, slightly below the US$420,000 expected by analysts. Despite a better-than-expected loss per share of US$1.47, the stock is down roughly 35% for the year.

The company has paused all commercial operations since June 2024 and has reduced its workforce by 7% to focus on developing the upgraded spaceplane. Virgin Galactic reported a revenue of $410,000 in the second quarter, below analysts' expectations. The company plans to raise prices for ticket sales when they resume at the start of 2026, with prices expected to be higher than the current $600,000 per seat.

Despite a decline in revenue due to a temporary flight stop, the market is impressed by the company's consistent reorientation. The company reports a net loss of $67 million for the second quarter, a significant improvement from the $94 million loss in the same period last year. This success is based on drastic cost reductions, with operating expenses decreasing from $106 million to $70 million. However, the revenue fell short of analyst expectations, with only $0.4 million, compared to $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. The reason for this is the deliberate stop of commercial spaceflights in favor of developing the new Delta-Class spacecraft. Despite the strategic revenue decline, the financial situation remains stable, with liquid assets of $508 million. The company's operational cash flow improved from a loss of $79 million to a loss of $55 million. The progress in the Delta program gives reason for hope, with the wing and feather assembly of the new spacecraft expected to be completed this quarter, and the hull to be completed by early 2026. Virgin Galactic remains committed to its timeline for resuming commercial flights in the fall of 2026. The company is also exploring new business areas, including a possible partnership with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the opening of a second spaceport in Italy. The market is rewarding the strategic reorientation, with the stock showing a robust performance despite short-term revenue declines. Investors seem to trust that the investments in the next generation of spacecraft will pay off in the long term.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 07, 2025 08:04 AM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-Virgin_Galactic_Aktie_Strategische_Wende_zahlt_sich_aus-18881603)\n\n**Virgin Galactic Stock Takes Off After Q2 Earnings, Company Continues To Target Commercial Service In 2026**\nVirgin Galactic Holdings Inc (NYSE:SPCE) shares rose 11.4% in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company reported second-quarter financial results.

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014including corporate restructuring, bankruptcy law, venture capital, business administration, finance, and aerospace management\u2014there is strong consensus that Virgin Galactic is unlikely to file for bankruptcy protection before January 1, 2026. The most heavily weighted reasons are the company's substantial cash reserves ($424 million as of September 2025), current quarterly cash burn of $90-100 million (providing runway well past the resolution window), and ongoing access to equity capital despite significant dilution. All experts acknowledge that Virgin Galactic is in deep financial distress, as evidenced by extremely poor Altman Z and Piotroski F scores, high leverage, and persistent negative margins. However, these indicators typically signal elevated medium-term rather than immediate bankruptcy risk\u2014particularly for public, pre-revenue/high-burn technology companies that can continue raising capital. No expert identifies any imminent external catalyst (such as a major debt maturity, lawsuit, or regulatory action) that would force bankruptcy within the next 6 weeks. The base rate for companies in similar positions filing for bankruptcy in such a short period is cited as extremely low, and all agree that only a sudden, unanticipated, and catastrophic event would force a near-term bankruptcy filing. Final individual probabilities for a filing before January 1, 2026, are clustered between 2% and 7%. The collective outlook is that bankruptcy is possible but highly unlikely in the immediate term, though long-term viability remains deeply questionable.",
