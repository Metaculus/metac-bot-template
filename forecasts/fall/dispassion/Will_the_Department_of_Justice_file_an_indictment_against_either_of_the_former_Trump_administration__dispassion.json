The White House has issued explicit instructions to investigate Krebs and Taylor, and the DOJ is actively pursuing other high-profile cases against ex-officials. At the same time, there is little to no public evidence that Krebs or Taylor committed indictable offenses, and both have been vocal and public in their denials. Judicial pushback, media scrutiny, and internal DOJ resistance may raise the bar for any such indictment, but the administration has shown a willingness to override institutional norms. The increasing use of executive authority to broaden definitions of 'domestic terrorism' and 'espionage' is noteworthy and could provide a legal pretext for an indictment even in the absence of real criminal conduct. Balancing these factors, the probability of at least one indictment is substantially elevated compared to the historical base rate, but still does not exceed 50% given the lack of specific allegations against Krebs or Taylor and the real risk of backlash or judicial intervention.",

While the DOJ's independence has been eroded, the lack of clear evidence against either Krebs or Taylor, combined with visible judicial skepticism (as in the Comey case), makes such an indictment procedurally fraught and legally tenuous. The time window is also narrowing, as federal indictments\u2014particularly in complex, high-profile cases\u2014generally require more lead time for investigation, grand jury proceedings, and interagency coordination. Furthermore, indicting Krebs or Taylor (especially without strong evidence) risks further delegitimizing the DOJ and provoking resistance from within the federal judicial system.

From an Elite Deviance Theory perspective, while the risks of politicized prosecution are indeed higher, the practical and reputational costs of indicting these two relatively high-profile (and currently less prominently accused) dissenters are significant. The recent pattern of indictments has focused on figures for whom at least some colorable legal theory or evidence could be marshaled; in contrast, the public case against Krebs and Taylor is almost entirely rhetorical and lacks the procedural signals (e.g., leaks, subpoenas, grand jury movement) that preceded other indictments. The window for action is rapidly narrowing, and the DOJ may prioritize targets with more immediately actionable cases (such as Brennan). Thus, while the probability is meaningfully elevated above historic norms, the estimate should be moderated downward\u2014closer to the mid-to-high 20s or low 30s\u2014to reflect these additional constraining factors."

The critiques further reinforce that, while the status quo is disrupted, the DOJ still faces real friction in manufacturing a case against Krebs or Taylor compared to other targets. No evidence has surfaced of grand jury activity or imminent legal action against them, and the remaining time window is shrinking. As such, while my initial estimate reflected an elevated risk, I find the 35% forecast a bit high relative to the modal consensus and the most compelling arguments.

The critiques of higher forecasts (in the 35\u201340% range) were persuasive, highlighting that even amid a norm-breaking administration, institutional and procedural barriers still exert substantial drag. Given the very short time window left and absence of actionable leaks or legal maneuvering in the public record, I see no reason to raise my probability.

The principal debate is whether the probability should be in the low-to-mid 30s or a bit higher; arguments for reducing the estimate slightly (to closer to 35%) are compelling, especially given the lack of any current grand jury signals for Krebs or Taylor and the DOJ's plausible focus on other targets.

The probe stems from allegations that Brennan knowingly made false statements to Congress in 2023 regarding his role in the intelligence community's handling of the Steele dossier\u2014a collection of memos by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele alleging a coordinated election conspiracy between Donald Trump and Kremlin officials. According to retired FBI special agent Jody Weis, Brennan claimed he first saw the dossier after the 2016 election and that the CIA was opposed to including it in the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA). However, evidence, including an email stating 'my bottom line is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report,' contradicts this. Weis revealed that Brennan overruled senior CIA analysts' objections and insisted on including the dossier, despite its lack of reliability. The House report confirmed the ICA referenced and summarized the dossier, undermining Brennan\u2019s claim that it was not used. The investigation follows Brennan\u2019s referral to the DOJ for potential criminal prosecution, with GOP lawmakers like Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan demanding indictment. The DOJ\u2019s actions, along with the indictment of James Comey, are seen by critics as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to hold Obama-era officials accountable for their roles in the 'Russia collusion hoax,' which, according to the report, 'totally undermined President [Donald] Trump's first term.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[WCIV](https://abcnews4.com/news/nation-world/doj-gearing-up-to-issue-grand-jury-subpoenas-amid-john-brennan-investigation-reports)\n\n**Vance Lands in an Unholy Mess as ICE Barbie Goon Trashes the Pope**\nTricia McLaughlin, the assistant homeland security secretary and chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), publicly dismissed Pope Leo XIV's plea for pastoral access to detained migrants as false, stating that religious organizations have 'ALWAYS been welcome' and that ICE 'does not separate families.' This statement contradicts documented evidence: under the Trump administration, including in the second term beginning January 2025, over 400 children have been referred to federal shelters during raids, with parents often forced to choose between self-deportation or separation. The New York Times reported at least nine 'interior separation' cases, and a Guardian investigation found widespread revivals of family separations, with nearly 44,000 individuals, including 1,000 children, moved in early 2025. McLaughlin\u2019s claim that a 13-year-old detainee in Everett, Massachusetts, had a 'gun and an extensive rap sheet' was denied by police. The incident intensified tensions surrounding Vice President JD Vance, a self-described 'baby Catholic' who converted in 2019 and is now caught between the Pope\u2019s moral appeal on migrant rights and his administration\u2019s hardline stance. Vance demanded the name of a White House staffer who previously called the Pope 'doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.' The Daily Beast contacted DHS and the White House to confirm whether McLaughlin\u2019s attack represented official policy; McLaughlin responded only, 'I'm a Catholic.' Critics, including Democratic Catholic activist Christopher Hale, condemned her remarks as 'beyond the pale.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 03:28 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/jd-vance-lands-in-an-unholy-mess-as-ice-barbie-goon-trashes-pope-leo/)\n\n**DOJ Filing Shows Comey Expected 'President-Elect Clinton'**\nFederal prosecutors in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia filed documents revealing James Comey's pre-2016 election expectations of working under a President-elect Hillary Clinton, along with communications involving his longtime associate Daniel Richman, who provided information to reporters. The filing, submitted by acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan and Deputy U.S. Attorney Tyler Lemmons, contradicts Comey\u2019s prior testimony that he did not approve outside or anonymous press engagement on major cases. The documents include emails showing Comey was briefed by Richman\u2014listed as a special government employee (SGE)\u2014on media contacts related to the Clinton email investigation, even as Richman\u2019s official paperwork lapsed and remained unsigned in late 2016. Handwritten notes from late September 2016, found in a secure FBI facility, indicate Comey was aware of intelligence suggesting a plan by Hillary Clinton to tie Donald Trump to Russia\u2014raising questions about the accuracy of his 2020 Senate testimony. Richman admitted to speaking with reporters on Comey\u2019s behalf, including New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, and sought to correct unfavorable media coverage and shape future reporting. Records show he distributed Comey\u2019s memos in 2017. Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress, with a trial set for January 5, 2026. He pleaded not guilty. The indictment, secured before the statute of limitations expired, was sought by Halligan, who replaced Erik Siebert as U.S. attorney. President Donald Trump responded by calling Comey 'worse than a Democrat' and asserting others who 'weaponized the Department of Justice' could also face indictment. Former Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk accused Comey of misconduct, calling him 'the most corrupt FBI Director' and comparing him to Jussie Smollett. White House adviser Peter Navarro labeled Comey 'the mastermind or the useful idiot' behind the Steele dossier. Fox News\u2019s Trey Gowdy argued Comey believed he had moral authority to override established processes, citing the July 2016 Clinton announcement, the October letter to Congress, and his 2020 testimony. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John Cornyn (R-TX) called the indictment 'long time overdue' and emphasized the need for accountability, with Graham noting Comey had intelligence about Clinton\u2019s alleged plan and Cornyn claiming Comey was 'bound and determined to destroy' Trump after his 2017 firing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/05/doj-filing-james-comey-expected-president-elect-clinton-approved-anonymous-communication-with-nyt-other-press/)\n\n**Judge in Comey case admonishes Justice Department for \"indict first, investigate second\" posture**\nA federal judge, Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in Alexandria, Virginia, criticized the Justice Department's prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey, calling its approach of 'indict first, investigate second' 'highly unusual.' The judge ordered the Justice Department to provide all grand jury evidence and related materials to Comey's legal team by the close of business on Thursday, November 6, 2025, underscoring his concern over prosecutors' conduct. Comey was indicted in October 2025 on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice related to his 2017 Senate testimony about whether he authorized anonymous leaks during the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. The indictment specifically alleges that Comey falsely denied giving permission to Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and longtime friend, to serve as an anonymous source. Evidence central to the case includes data collected during the 'Arctic Haze' investigation (2019\u20132020), which examined how classified details about the Clinton probe leaked into a 2017 New York Times article. Four warrants were executed on Richman during that probe, and his seized materials\u2014such as hard drives, phone, and email records\u2014may contain evidence relevant to the indictment. Comey\u2019s attorneys, including Rebekah Donaleski and Patrick Fitzgerald, stated they have not been granted access to this data and cannot screen it for privileged information. Donaleski expressed 'grave concern' that the withholding of evidence may violate the Fourth Amendment. Fitzgerald noted delays in obtaining his security clearance have prevented him from accessing classified evidence. Nathaniel Lemons, an assistant U.S. attorney leading the prosecution, argued that the evidence is secured and will not be accessed until the court approves a handling plan. Judge Fitzpatrick emphasized that Comey\u2019s legal team is 'entitled to this information quickly' and warned prosecutors they may use evidence 'at their own risk' if it is later found to be privileged.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:05 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-comey-case-judge-indict-first-investigate-second/)\n\n**Judge scolds Comey prosecutors, orders records to be produced**\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered prosecutors to provide grand jury records and evidence from the investigation into former FBI Director James Comey by the end of Thursday, November 6, 2025, criticizing the Department of Justice (DOJ) for 'indict first and investigate later.' Comey, who was present at the hearing but did not speak, and his lawyers stated they had not seen the materials, prompting the judge to declare, 'We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today.' The materials include communications between Comey and Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman, a special government employee at the FBI, seized in 2019 and 2020. Prosecutors allege Comey encouraged Richman to speak with reporters and lied to Congress about authorizing anonymous sources. Comey pleaded not guilty last month to charges related to false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020, where he claimed he did not authorize a media leak about the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton and the Trump-Russia probe. The DOJ defended President Trump's social media posts calling for Comey's prosecution, asserting they were not retaliatory, while Comey's lawyers argued the case is politically motivated and a departure from the DOJ's traditional ethical standards. Trump had used Truth Social to call for the prosecution of Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former national security advisor John Bolton, all of whom have since been indicted. Comey's legal team emphasized that the DOJ has historically followed only facts and law, and this case represents a sharp break from that tradition. The trial is scheduled to begin on January 5, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 05:52 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5591009-court-requests-records-james-comey-indictment/)\n\n**DOJ gearing up to issue grand jury subpoenas amid John Brennan investigation: reports**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is preparing to issue multiple grand jury subpoenas as part of an ongoing investigation into former CIA Director John Brennan.

The DOJ\u2019s actions, along with the indictment of James Comey, are seen by critics as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to hold Obama-era officials accountable for their roles in the 'Russia collusion hoax,' which, according to the report, 'totally undermined President [Donald] Trump's first term.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[WCIV](https://abcnews4.com/news/nation-world/doj-gearing-up-to-issue-grand-jury-subpoenas-amid-john-brennan-investigation-reports)\n\n**Vance Lands in an Unholy Mess as ICE Barbie Goon Trashes the Pope**\nTricia McLaughlin, the assistant homeland security secretary and chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), publicly dismissed Pope Leo XIV's plea for pastoral access to detained migrants as false, stating that religious organizations have 'ALWAYS been welcome' and that ICE 'does not separate families.' This statement contradicts documented evidence: under the Trump administration, including in the second term beginning January 2025, over 400 children have been referred to federal shelters during raids, with parents often forced to choose between self-deportation or separation. The New York Times reported at least nine 'interior separation' cases, and a Guardian investigation found widespread revivals of family separations, with nearly 44,000 individuals, including 1,000 children, moved in early 2025. McLaughlin\u2019s claim that a 13-year-old detainee in Everett, Massachusetts, had a 'gun and an extensive rap sheet' was denied by police. The incident intensified tensions surrounding Vice President JD Vance, a self-described 'baby Catholic' who converted in 2019 and is now caught between the Pope\u2019s moral appeal on migrant rights and his administration\u2019s hardline stance. Vance demanded the name of a White House staffer who previously called the Pope 'doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about.' The Daily Beast contacted DHS and the White House to confirm whether McLaughlin\u2019s attack represented official policy; McLaughlin responded only, 'I'm a Catholic.'

The filing, submitted by acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan and Deputy U.S. Attorney Tyler Lemmons, contradicts Comey\u2019s prior testimony that he did not approve outside or anonymous press engagement on major cases. The documents include emails showing Comey was briefed by Richman\u2014listed as a special government employee (SGE)\u2014on media contacts related to the Clinton email investigation, even as Richman\u2019s official paperwork lapsed and remained unsigned in late 2016. Handwritten notes from late September 2016, found in a secure FBI facility, indicate Comey was aware of intelligence suggesting a plan by Hillary Clinton to tie Donald Trump to Russia\u2014raising questions about the accuracy of his 2020 Senate testimony. Richman admitted to speaking with reporters on Comey\u2019s behalf, including New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, and sought to correct unfavorable media coverage and shape future reporting. Records show he distributed Comey\u2019s memos in 2017. Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress, with a trial set for January 5, 2026. He pleaded not guilty. The indictment, secured before the statute of limitations expired, was sought by Halligan, who replaced Erik Siebert as U.S. attorney. President Donald Trump responded by calling Comey 'worse than a Democrat' and asserting others who 'weaponized the Department of Justice' could also face indictment. Former Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk accused Comey of misconduct, calling him 'the most corrupt FBI Director' and comparing him to Jussie Smollett. White House adviser Peter Navarro labeled Comey 'the mastermind or the useful idiot' behind the Steele dossier. Fox News\u2019s Trey Gowdy argued Comey believed he had moral authority to override established processes, citing the July 2016 Clinton announcement, the October letter to Congress, and his 2020 testimony. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John Cornyn (R-TX) called the indictment 'long time overdue' and emphasized the need for accountability, with Graham noting Comey had intelligence about Clinton\u2019s alleged plan and Cornyn claiming Comey was 'bound and determined to destroy' Trump after his 2017 firing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/05/doj-filing-james-comey-expected-president-elect-clinton-approved-anonymous-communication-with-nyt-other-press/)\n\n**Judge scolds Comey prosecutors, orders records to be produced**\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered prosecutors to provide grand jury records and evidence from the investigation into former FBI Director James Comey by the end of Thursday, November 6, 2025, criticizing the Department of Justice (DOJ) for 'indict first and investigate later.' Comey, who was present at the hearing but did not speak, and his lawyers stated they had not seen the materials, prompting the judge to declare, 'We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today.' The materials include communications between Comey and Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman, a special government employee at the FBI, seized in 2019 and 2020. Prosecutors allege Comey encouraged Richman to speak with reporters and lied to Congress about authorizing anonymous sources. Comey pleaded not guilty last month to charges related to false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020, where he claimed he did not authorize a media leak about the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton and the Trump-Russia probe. The DOJ defended President Trump's social media posts calling for Comey's prosecution, asserting they were not retaliatory, while Comey's lawyers argued the case is politically motivated and a departure from the DOJ's traditional ethical standards. Trump had used Truth Social to call for the prosecution of Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former national security advisor John Bolton, all of whom have since been indicted. Comey's legal team emphasized that the DOJ has historically followed only facts and law, and this case represents a sharp break from that tradition.

The New York Times reported that law enforcement seized Wien's phone in connection with the probe. A White House spokesperson condemned doxxing and threats against administration officials and their families, stating such actions should be thoroughly investigated. Wien's lawyer argued the protest was protected speech, asserting that 'they were speaking truth to power, and that is really at the core of our Constitution.' Meanwhile, conservative online influencers falsely claimed that several Arizona teachers mocked slain MAGA figure Charlie Kirk with their Halloween costumes, leading to a wave of threats against the educators. Donald Trump's pardon of Changpeng Zhao, a convicted crypto figure with ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency ventures, raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest, as Trump claimed ignorance of the pardon's implications. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, publicly criticized former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, over allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor, citing a 2024 House Ethics report that found 'substantial evidence' of possible violations of state laws, though the Justice Department declined to file charges. The controversy reflects growing internal conflict within the MAGA movement over antisemitism and extremist sympathies. Additionally, the Trump administration's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as revealed by a Federal Reserve Office of Inspector General audit, has put Americans' confidential data at risk. A newly launched Trump website falsely blames Democrats for a government shutdown by spreading debunked claims about criminal immigrants receiving health care, a narrative also repeated by Trump in a '60 Minutes' interview. PolitiFact has refuted these claims.

Assistant Attorney General Matt Olsen convened a conference call that evening, during which Justice Department expert Julie Edelstein stated, 'If it was anybody else, we would arrest him tomorrow,' underscoring the severity of knowingly retaining and concealing classified records after a May 2022 subpoena. The investigation was triggered by a critical tip from Molly Michael, a former Trump aide, who provided a photo showing over 80 boxes of documents stored at Mar-a-Lago\u2014far more than the 15 boxes Trump had returned to the National Archives. Despite Trump\u2019s public cooperation, including welcoming FBI agents and claiming to be 'an open book,' the search revealed extensive mismanagement of sensitive materials. The Justice Department and FBI faced internal and external pressure: FBI Director Chris Wray sought to justify the raid publicly, but DOJ officials delayed a statement fearing political backlash. The classified documents were so sensitive that even top officials like Olsen lacked clearance to view some, with certain materials requiring presidential or cabinet-level authorization. The search triggered violent reactions, including a threatening post on Gab by a Trump supporter and a failed assault on an FBI field office in Cincinnati by a Navy veteran, who later died in a standoff. The agents involved were evacuated for safety after their names were leaked. A year later, Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump on 37 felony counts, but a Trump-appointed judge dismissed the case on questionable legal grounds. The account, drawn from interviews for the book 'Injustice: How Politics and Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department,' reveals deep institutional tension, national security risks, and the unprecedented political pressures facing the Justice Department.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 11:39 AM\nSource:[MSNBC.com](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-arrest-classified-documents-probe-maralago-rcna241155)\n\n**Former senior DHS official Miles Taylor launches new web tool to plan protests against Trump administration**\nMiles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has launched a new website called defiance.org on November 1, 2025, to coordinate peaceful, lawful, and defiant resistance against President Trump and his policies. The platform, backed by a bipartisan coalition of over 50 former national security officials, whistleblowers, and elected officials\u2014including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman, and Joe Walsh\u2014aims to serve as a centralized 'Google' for activism, offering resources for protests, legal defense, and mutual aid. Taylor, who anonymously authored a 2018 New York Times op-ed alleging a 'quiet resistance' within Trump\u2019s administration, disclosed his authorship in 2020. The site was launched in response to the October 'No Kings' rallies and features a video from actor Robert DeNiro urging civic action. The White House has sharply criticized Taylor, calling him a 'TDS clown' and accusing him of fabricating claims about a government 'resistance' and leaking classified information. In April 2025, President Trump issued an executive memo ordering investigations into Taylor\u2019s conduct, including revoking his security clearances. Taylor denies any wrongdoing. The site\u2019s mission includes supporting those targeted by the administration, with future plans to mobilize legal and public support for figures like Senator Adam Schiff, who is under Justice Department investigation.

According to a Washington Post report, at least six recent videos with similar visual or geographic distortions\u2014promoting an anti-immigration agenda\u2014have garnered millions of views, illustrating the growing use of misleading content by the Trump administration in its digital strategy. The White House and DHS did not dispute the inaccuracies but defended the videos, stating they represent a 'small percentage' of over 400 annual posts and aim to highlight law enforcement work. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated, 'Violence and riots against law enforcement are unacceptable, regardless of location,' while White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson affirmed the administration would continue using 'engaging content and memorable memes' to promote the president's agenda. The strategy involves internal photographers and videographers documenting ICE raids and protests to create viral social media content. One widely viewed video depicting chaos in Chicago used footage from other states and was seen over 1.4 million times, exemplifying how image manipulation can shape public perception, according to experts. John Cohen, former DHS official now at the Internet Security Center, warned that such inaccuracy undermines public trust: 'If people believe you are imprecise or not objectively assessing a threat, they won\u2019t listen.' The report also found videos falsely presenting operations in Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, and Nantucket as occurring in Washington, and using footage from Illinois to depict events in Oregon and Tennessee. Another video falsely claimed that prior administrations had 'eroded our way of life' but showed 2019 operations under Trump\u2019s first term. The ICE also published a retouched photo of a woman holding a sign in Portland, editing out a police insult on the ground. Eddie Perez, former civic integrity director at X, criticized the government\u2019s approach: 'We are witnessing the collapse of governmental responsibility through fact-based communication. They are not communicating actions and results. They are acting like filmmakers, trying to make people laugh, scare them, inspire emotions\u2014regardless of truth.' Trump, who has advocated for using the military in an 'internal war,' has pressured for deploying National Guard troops to major U.S. cities\u2014mostly Democratic-leaning\u2014to combat crime and protests against his mass deportation campaign. Despite local authorities stating most mobilizations were peaceful and violence was easily contained, Trump militarized policing in Washington in August, sent troops to Memphis in September, and deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard members and marines to Los Angeles in June during protests over aggressive immigration enforcement in California. Most troops have since been withdrawn.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 03:01 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/10/30/governo-trump-divulgou-videos-manipulados-sobre-protestos-e-operacoes-anti-imigracao-diz-jornal.ghtml)\n\n**Kristi Noem's DHS accused of 'fabricating' report critical of FEMA**\nA report investigating claims that FEMA diverted disaster aid to undocumented immigrants and neglected U.S. citizens in areas supporting Donald Trump found no evidence to substantiate the allegations. Despite this, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and her leadership allegedly suppressed the original findings and commissioned a new report containing false allegations against President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and FEMA workers, according to former senior FEMA officials cited by CNN. The initial investigation was prompted by claims made by Donald Trump following Hurricane Helene, but was ultimately deemed unsubstantiated. However, DHS leadership reportedly demanded a revised report, which concluded that FEMA employees under Biden intentionally delayed aid for political reasons\u2014a claim now disputed by former DHS and FEMA officials. CNN reported that investigators noted a few instances where canvassers mentioned 'Trump' or 'Biden' in notes, but these were typically related to gun signage, not political bias, and the report did not demonstrate that aid was denied due to such notations. Former officials accused Noem and DHS of spreading misinformation to justify dismantling FEMA, framing disaster aid as a political tool. One unnamed FEMA official stated, 'They\u2019ve been looking to prove that narrative any way they can... don\u2019t fabricate it because it meets your political narrative. That\u2019s just bad government.' Regarding claims of armed confrontations between residents and FEMA workers, a former supervisor dismissed them as implausible, saying, 'FEMA employees are not law enforcement officers... this idea that they\u2019re just going to run into harm\u2019s way to register somebody is ridiculous.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/noem-fema/)\n\n**Two Federal Prosecutors Placed on Leave Hours After Including 'Inflammatory Misrepresentations' About Jan. 6 in Court Filing**\nTwo federal prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., were placed on leave by the Department of Justice hours after filing a sentencing memorandum in the case of Taylor Taranto. The memorandum described Jan. 6, 2021, protesters as 'a mob of rioters,' which the Department of Justice reportedly deemed 'inflammatory misrepresentations.' According to ABC News and The Washington Post, both prosecutors were locked out of their government devices and informed they would be on enforced furlough until the federal shutdown ends, after which they would be placed on leave. The filing occurred in the case of Taranto, who was pardoned by President Donald Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 protests but was later convicted in May 2025 on three counts related to a 2023 bomb hoax. The Justice Department did not comment on the disciplinary action. The sentencing memorandum alleged that Taranto entered the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and later promoted conspiracy theories. Taranto was convicted of illegally carrying two firearms without a license, unlawfully possessing ammunition, and making false statements and hoaxes. On June 28, 2023, he livestreamed himself claiming to be working on a detonator and threatening to drive a car bomb into the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which houses a neutron reactor. He then drove to Alexandria, Virginia, parked his van in the middle of the street, and fled. Police found two firearms, multiple magazines, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his vehicle during a search. Taranto faces sentencing before U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro stated that violence and threats against law enforcement or government officials are taken extremely seriously, regardless of political affiliation.

The report identified at least six DHS-produced videos over the past three months that misrepresented the location, timing, or context of footage. One August montage claiming to show federal agents securing Washington, D.C., featured scenes filmed months earlier in Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, and off the coast of Nantucket\u2014over 400 miles from the capital. Another video promoting 'Antifa terrorists' attacking federal facilities in Portland was actually filmed outside an ICE building in Broadview, Illinois, 1,700 miles away, and cropped out the original journalist\u2019s watermark. A clip about a federal surge in Memphis used footage from the same Illinois facility without disclosure. Additionally, footage used to highlight border failures showed events from 2019\u2014during Trump\u2019s first term\u2014despite being presented as recent. In one case, an image of a woman holding a pro-ICE sign in Portland was digitally altered to remove a Spanish-language curse\u2014'Chinga la migra'\u2014written on the pavement beneath her. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has faced criticism for her highly staged, media-friendly appearances, often involving full makeup, law enforcement gear, and cameras, which critics describe as social media-optimized photo-ops rather than factual reporting. The White House defended the strategy as using 'engaging content and banger memes,' with spokesperson Abigail Jackson refusing to issue corrections. Experts, including former DHS official John Cohen and former Twitter civic integrity leader Eddie Perez, warned that such deceptive editing risks eroding public trust, especially during emergencies, and likened the administration\u2019s approach to 'filmmakers' prioritizing emotional manipulation over factual truth. Despite backlash, DHS has expanded its in-house media operation, hiring videographers, deploying drones, and producing news-style segments that denounce 'fake news hoaxes' and direct viewers to government channels for the 'FACTS.'

Taylor describes the memo as 'Orwellian' and one of the most alarming government documents he has ever read, arguing it grants the White House sweeping authority to redefine protest as 'domestic terrorism' and expand surveillance to individuals, nonprofits, donors, and online activists based on ideological indicators such as anti-American or anti-capitalist views. The memo broadens the definition of 'organized political violence' and directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle networks linked to such activity, including foundations and funders. Critics, including civil-liberties watchdogs and legal experts, warn that this could lead to the criminalization of dissent, with minor legal infractions or even online sharing of content potentially resulting in individuals being placed on watchlists typically reserved for foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS and al Qaeda. The administration claims NSPM-7 is a necessary response to 'heinous' political violence, citing incidents like the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and asserts it will dismantle networks that 'incite' violence. However, the memo's broad language, combined with a separate executive action designating 'Antifa' as a terrorist organization\u2014despite no legal framework for such a domestic designation\u2014has raised alarms about the creation of a de facto domestic terrorism regime. Taylor urges Congress and the courts to intervene before political activism is equated with terrorism. The Justice Department has already circulated guidance enabling tax and criminal scrutiny of nonprofits linked to unrest, signaling enforcement actions are underway. The central question now is who defines the line between protest and terrorism, and how much power the White House should hold over that boundary.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:54 PM\nSource:[The Inquisitr](https://www.inquisitr.com/ex-trump-aide-warns-of-orwellian-white-house-memo)\n\n**Ex-Trump Official On 'Enemies List' Outlines 8 Ways To Defy His 'Wannabe-Dictator Tantrums'**\nThe article reports that former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, who had previously criticized President Donald Trump in a 2018 New\u202fYork\u202fTimes essay, has issued an eight\u2011point plan of action on X (formerly Twitter) after Trump ordered the Department of Justice to investigate him for alleged treason. Taylor states, '1. First, I will not shut up,' and continues, '2. I will not apologize for telling the truth,' among other points. He claims the investigation stems from a memorandum in April that labeled his conduct as a possible violation of the Espionage Act. Taylor also notes his inclusion on the \u2018Random Enemies List\u2019 in the 2023 book *Government Gangsters* and asserts he will not fear retaliation, saying, 'I will not fear,' and that he will continue to organize politically against Trump. The piece presents these statements as Taylor\u2019s response to the investigation, without providing counter\u2011perspectives or official DOJ statements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 04:57 PM\nSource:[HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miles-taylor-donald-trump-defy-dictator-tantrums_n_68d3e8a1e4b0ae58bfe9f828)\n\n",

    "summary": "Experts across law, political science, federal prosecution, and sociology generally agree that the probability of the Department of Justice indicting Christopher Krebs or Miles Taylor before January 1, 2026, is elevated compared to historical norms, though it remains below 50%. Key arguments increasing the probability include direct and public presidential pressure, an unprecedented recent pattern of DOJ indictments against other Trump-era critics (Comey, Bolton, Letitia James), and an administration with demonstrated willingness to override traditional prosecutorial discretion. Factors decreasing the probability are the lack of public evidence or credible allegations of criminal conduct by Krebs or Taylor, internal DOJ and judicial pushback (including procedural scrutiny and admonitions against politicized prosecutions), high reputational and legal risks, and the very short timeline remaining before resolution. While the experts note real potential for a last-minute, politically motivated indictment, the procedural hurdles, status quo inertia, and lack of a plausible legal case are significant obstacles. Final probability estimates from the experts range from 12% to 40%, with most forecasts clustered in the 25\u201338% range, reflecting a consensus of meaningful but still sub-coin-flip risk, heavily influenced by the abnormal political context but constrained by enduring legal and institutional norms.",
