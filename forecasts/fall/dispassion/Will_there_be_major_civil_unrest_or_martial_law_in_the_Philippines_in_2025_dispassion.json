Protests, although large, have not led to major violence or mass arrests. Security forces, while politicized, are not visibly split or mutinous. Marcos appears incentivized to avoid draconian measures given domestic and international scrutiny. The most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome is localized martial law in Mindanao in response to elite-manipulated violence, but recent patterns suggest both sides are still playing a cautious, transactional game. Therefore, the status quo (No) remains most likely, but the probability of escalation is meaningfully non-negligible given the number of risk factors.

The window for a major crisis is narrowing but remains open, especially given the unresolved Mindanao situation and the Duterte family's explicit threats.

Nonetheless, the potential for a rapid escalation\u2014especially in Mindanao\u2014cannot be completely discounted given elite instability and regional grievances. Overall, the status quo is likely to hold, but with a higher-than-background risk due to current political dynamics.

The patron-client system indeed heightens volatility and the potential for regional destabilization, but it also tends to incentivize elite negotiation, cooptation, and 'backstage' dealmaking over outright escalation. The military\u2019s institutional interests do not currently align with either full-scale repression or enabling a Duterte-led regional insurrection, and the Marcos administration, while incentivized to show strength, risks too much domestically and internationally by invoking martial law absent a clear, large-scale breakdown. The Duterte family\u2019s threats have yet to be matched by mass mobilization or operational capacity for sustained unrest. Unless there is a dramatic, exogenous shock, the structural inertia and the transactional nature of Philippine elite politics are more likely to produce noisy standoffs rather than threshold-crossing unrest or martial law declarations. Thus, while your scenario is plausible, I argue that your probability is too high given the recent patterns of elite contestation and the state\u2019s demonstrated preference for selective, targeted repression."

Historically, even severe elite splits have resulted in tactical cooptation or negotiated settlements, not open civil conflict. Furthermore, the Marcos administration faces high reputational and diplomatic costs for martial law, especially under global scrutiny due to the ICC trial. The security sector remains largely loyal to the center and shows no sign of defecting to Duterte interests at scale. While Mindanao remains a flashpoint, the Duterte network has not yet demonstrated either the mass mobilization or logistical capacity to force a crisis at the level required by the resolution criteria.

From a political risk assessment perspective, I find your approach defensible: you capture how symbolic shocks (like Duterte's arrest) can heighten the sense of relative deprivation and prime groups for mobilization, especially in a context where Mindanao has a history of escalatory cycles following elite provocation. While I assign a somewhat lower probability (13%) based on the high bar set by the resolution criteria and the inertia of the status quo, your forecast correctly highlights that the conditions for sudden escalation are present, even if not yet sufficient.

Your emphasis on the effectiveness of state containment strategies, the fragmented nature of opposition, and the lack of a galvanizing national crisis mirrors the historical pattern of Philippine politics, where large-scale unrest is rare even during periods of tension.

I agree with your assessment that Mindanao is the key flashpoint, but that national-level escalation remains unlikely without a dramatic new trigger. Your analysis also notes that government responses have been measured, focusing on targeted arrests rather than sweeping crackdowns, which is consistent with the post-authoritarian pattern of Philippine protest management.

While national-scale unrest remains unlikely, the bar for a Yes resolution is not national but could be met by regional martial law or by cumulative violent incidents in Mindanao. From a patron-clientelism perspective, periods of elite rupture can rapidly become unmanageable if one side feels existentially threatened and mobilizes its networks for escalation, especially in a context where national authority is being directly challenged.

Critiques of my forecast highlight that, although the patron-clientelism tradition makes the Philippines structurally volatile during periods of elite fracture, it also incentivizes elite bargaining, transactional settlement, and avoidance of open conflict. The Security Studies and Coup Risk perspectives specifically argue that the military remains aligned with the center, and that Duterte's threats, while serious, have not been matched by actionable mass mobilization or a split in the security sector. Additionally, the bar for a Yes outcome is high, and although Mindanao remains a plausible flashpoint for regional martial law or violence, recent history and the lack of a catalytic event make rapid escalation less likely. Conversely, defenses of higher probabilities (e.g., 25%) emphasize the tail risks and the presence of multiple converging risk factors, which I agree cannot be dismissed entirely. On balance, I find the critiques persuasive in that I may have overweighted the likelihood of threshold-crossing unrest in the immediate term, especially given the short time frame and inertia of the status quo, but I still believe risk is meaningfully elevated compared to pure base rate. I am therefore revising my probability downward for calibration, though remaining somewhat above the group median.",

The original question opened on 2025-03-21 12:40:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36013). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nOn March 11, 2025, [former president of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte was arrested in Manila](https://apnews.com/article/rodrigo-duterte-manila-philippines-icc-9b9d08b8832b43282db53418535fb245) and flown to the Netherlands for trial at the [International Criminal Court](https://www.britannica.com/topic/International-Criminal-Court). Current president Bongbong Marcos has said the arrest is not political repression against his predecessor, who is the father of current vice president Sara Duterte. Marcos is the son of [Ferdinand Marcos](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-E-Marcos), Philippines head of state from 1965 to 1986, who ruled as an authoritarian, including a 9-year period of martial law.\n\nThe Philippines has experienced [decades of civil conflict of varying intensity, including by separatists, communists, and state actors](https://gsdrc.org/publications/conflict-analysis-of-the-philippines/). Conflict deaths since 1989 are over 20,000, averaging 585 per year ([source](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/deaths-in-armed-conflicts-by-country?tab=chart\\&country=~PHL)):\n\n![](https://metaculus-web-media.s3.amazonaws.com/user_uploaded/%C3%A5%C2%BE%C3%A7_2ucIR17.png)\n\nGeographically, these conflicts are concentrated in [Mindanao](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mindanao), a southern island that is the Philippines' second largest. Truces among and within these groups are [often mediated by the military or police](https://apnews.com/article/southern-philippines-land-dispute-moro-islamic-liberation-front-a9d2d4e185409279a21f19c2deaae368). Prior to his presidency, Rodrigo Duterte had served as a popular mayor of Davao City, Mindanao's largest city. Duterte's relative popularity in the Davao area stems partly from his reputation as a law-and-order figure and effective truce broker among local fighting groups.\n\n[Martial law has been declared four times in the history of the Philippines](https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/features/martial-law-in-the-philippines-a00289-20200922-lfrm?s=ths48uim0s26782srnenrq1vj2): in 1944, 1972, 2009, and 2017.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":36013,\"question_id\":35443}}`",

On September 26, the three-woman PTC I unanimously rejected Duterte's request to be released to an undisclosed country under certain conditions, citing 'reasonable grounds to believe' that his continued detention is necessary to ensure his participation in proceedings and to prevent intimidation of potential witnesses and victims. The OTP argued that the defense's claims were 'unconvincing' and emphasized that Duterte still holds significant power and influence in the Philippines, particularly in his hometown of Davao City, where he won re-election as mayor in May 2025. The prosecution stressed that the ICC applies a 'low evidentiary threshold' for detention decisions and dismissed the defense's proposed conditions as insufficiently evaluated by the chamber. Regarding Duterte's cognitive health, the OTP stated that the medical reports submitted by the defense were untested, lacked clarity on legal standards, and were therefore insufficient to determine his fitness. The Office of Public Counsel for Victims also urged the Appeals Chamber to reject the appeal, asserting that all three grounds of the defense's argument lacked merit. Duterte faces three counts of murder related to 49 incidents of drug war killings between 2013 and 2018 during his tenure as mayor of Davao and as President.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 09:40 PM\nSource:[Inquirer](https://globalnation.inquirer.net/297362/affirm-ruling-on-duterte-appeals-icc-prosecutors-ask)\n\n**Survivors still reckon with Duterte's drug war**\nJoel Ejorcadas and Marlon Pepito Jr., survivors of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's drug war, continue to grieve and advocate for justice, commemorating 111 victims at the 'Dambana ng Paghilom' shrine in Caloocan's La Loma Catholic Cemetery. Both men, who live in the Navotas slums, made candles themselves as part of a program led by Redemptorist brother Ciriaco Santiago III, which employs relatives of drug war victims as candlemakers and baristas. Ejorcadas' brother Jomel was shot in the head in August 2016 after being accused of drug dealing, while Pepito's father and uncle were killed in January 2017 during a police raid targeting someone named 'Marlon.' Neither man wants to be photographed due to fear of police retaliation. In the years following their loved ones' deaths, they remained silent, afraid of whom to trust. Their trauma persisted: Pepito\u2019s brother developed severe anxiety around police and guns, requiring temporary shelter under Santiago\u2019s care. Now, eight years later, they are more outspoken, citing the International Criminal Court\u2019s (ICC) March 2025 arrest of Duterte on charges of crimes against humanity as a turning point. Ejorcadas said, 'A thorn was removed from my heart because, somehow, our fight is starting to bear fruit.' Both men are demanding that Duterte remain in detention. The ICC\u2019s Office of the Prosecutor and the Office of the Public Counsel for Victims have urged the Appeals Chamber to reject Duterte\u2019s appeal for interim release, arguing that the Pre-Trial Chamber\u2019s denial was legally sound and that the defense failed to prove humanitarian grounds for release, including claims about Duterte\u2019s medical condition.

These actions, justified by the administration as part of a war against drug cartels under the laws of armed conflict, have drawn strong condemnation from international legal experts. Volker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, declared the killings illegal under international law. Colombian President Gustavo Petro accused the U.S. of 'murder' in connection with the death of a fisherman. Legal scholar Philippe Sands, in an interview with POLITICO Magazine, argued that the killings may cross into international criminality, citing the precedent of the Augusto Pinochet case, where a former head of state was indicted in a foreign country for crimes against humanity. Sands highlighted a growing tension between the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2024 decision granting former presidents broad immunity for official conduct and the principles of international law established after Nuremberg. He warned that such immunity could create a 'green light' for actions like torture, disappearance, or murder if framed as national security. While the U.S. is not a party to the International Criminal Court (ICC), the ICC has jurisdiction if crimes occur on a state party\u2019s vessel or aircraft. The ICC has already issued an arrest warrant for former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte over extrajudicial killings linked to anti-drug campaigns. Sands noted that foreign governments, including Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil, may consider domestic investigations or inter-state cases at the International Court of Justice, though they risk political and economic retaliation. He emphasized that while prosecutions are politically complex, the existence of international legal mechanisms\u2014such as universal jurisdiction\u2014means that high-level officials may still face accountability. The broader context includes a U.S. double standard: supporting international law when applied to others (e.g., Sudan) but resisting it when applied to itself. Sands concluded that the situation remains a 'watch this space' scenario, with significant legal and political uncertainty ahead.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 01:55 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/watch-space-legal-fallout-trump-135500119.html)\n\n**'Watch This Space': The Legal Fallout From Trump's Deadly Boat Strikes**\nPhilippe Sands, an international law expert, discusses the legal and ethical implications of the Trump administration's reported use of military force in international waters near Central and South America, which resulted in at least 61 deaths between September 2 and October 27, 2024. According to Sands, these actions may violate international law, particularly the UN Charter\u2019s prohibition on the use of force (Article 2, paragraph 4), unless an armed attack occurs\u2014an exception under Article 51. He argues that targeting drug traffickers and couriers does not constitute an armed attack, and thus the use of military force under the laws of armed conflict is unjustified. Instead, such acts should be addressed through criminal law. Sands draws parallels to the 1998 arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in the UK, where the House of Lords ruled that heads of state are not immune from prosecution for international crimes like torture. This precedent, he notes, established a landmark shift toward accountability. However, the 2024 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. United States granted former presidents absolute immunity for official conduct related to core constitutional powers, creating a potential conflict with international legal norms. Sands warns this could create a 'green light' for actions that may cross into crimes against humanity, including murder, torture, or genocide. He highlights the International Criminal Court\u2019s (ICC) indictment of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte for crimes against humanity related to anti-drug killings, suggesting a precedent for holding leaders accountable. Although the U.S. is not a party to the ICC statute, the court may still have jurisdiction if crimes occur on vessels or aircraft of state parties. Sands cautions that foreign governments\u2014such as Colombia, Venezuela, or Brazil\u2014might initiate domestic investigations or inter-state cases, though political and economic retaliation is a real risk. He emphasizes that the U.S. remains a powerful actor in international law, and while the ICC has historically avoided investigating powerful nations, recent actions\u2014like the ICC\u2019s indictment of Russian President Putin and Israeli leaders\u2014show a shift. Sands concludes that the situation remains fluid: 'It's a sort of 'watch this space' type of scenario,' as the international legal order persists despite political resistance. He notes that even symbolic indictments can have real effects, such as deterring travel or influencing diplomatic behavior, citing anecdotal evidence including former U.S. President George W. Bush avoiding certain countries due to potential prosecution risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 01:55 PM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/11/01/trump-boat-strikes-international-law-interview-00632077)\n\n**ICC prosecutors urge Appeals Chamber to keep ex Philippine president Duterte detained**\nThe Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) at the International Criminal Court (ICC) has urged the Appeals Chamber to dismiss former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's appeal for temporary release, arguing that his defense failed to demonstrate any legal or factual errors in the Pre-Trial Chamber I's September 26 ruling denying his request for interim release under the Rome Statute. The OTP maintained that the chamber correctly determined that Duterte's detention remains necessary to ensure three key objectives: preventing flight, avoiding obstruction of justice, and safeguarding the integrity of the proceedings. The prosecution emphasized that Duterte's appeal was based on disagreement with the ruling rather than a valid judicial error, and criticized the defense for misstating the applicable law. Central to the OTP's argument is the risk of Duterte fleeing or interfering with justice, citing his political influence, network of loyal supporters\u2014including his daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte\u2014and his recent election as mayor of Davao City. The OTP also referenced the Appeals Chamber\u2019s prior acknowledgment that access to international contacts could enable a suspect to abscond, even without proof of intent. The prosecution defended the use of public sources such as media reports and NGO findings as legitimate evidence in ICC proceedings, noting that the risk of absconding increases with the severity of potential punishment and confirmed charges. Regarding health concerns, the OTP rejected Duterte\u2019s medical arguments as insufficient, stating that the chamber had already ruled his alleged ailments did not outweigh the risks of release, and that there is no evidence that detention poses serious harm to his wellbeing. The OTP further noted that the issue of Duterte\u2019s fitness to stand trial has not yet been evaluated and that the defense provided no clear legal basis for its assessment.

The filing was submitted on October 31, 2025, and published on November 1, 2025, by Khaleej Times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 10:41 AM\nSource:[Khaleej times](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/world/asia/icc-prosecution-detain-rodrigo-duterte)\n\n**ICC Prosecutor Demands Continued Detention of Rodrigo Duterte Amid Appeal Rejection**\nThe Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requested on Friday, October 31, 2025, that judges maintain the detention of former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and reject his appeal against the refusal of provisional release issued on September 26, 2025. The ICC Prosecutor argued that risks of flight, interference with the judicial process, and potential reoffending remain. The Office described the decision to uphold detention as 'reasonable and correct,' stating that Duterte's defense relied on mere disagreement, misrepresented the ruling's rationale, and misinterpreted procedural rules. The Prosecutor emphasized that judges had already found 'reasonable grounds' to believe Duterte committed crimes under the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction during his presidency and tenure as mayor of Davao. Detention remains necessary to ensure his presence at trial, protect the investigation, and prevent further crimes. The report included partially censored excerpts from statements by Duterte\u2019s associates, which the Prosecutor said demonstrate his ability\u2014directly or through intermediaries\u2014to obstruct justice. The Prosecutor also cited family members calling the arrest a 'kidnapping,' Duterte\u2019s physical resistance during his Manila arrest, his attempts to discredit the ICC, his repeated desire to return to the Philippines, and the possibility of a lengthy sentence if convicted. Regarding health and humanitarian arguments raised by the defense, the Prosecutor clarified that medical reports were intended solely to assess Duterte\u2019s fitness to attend trial, not to eliminate flight or obstruction risks. The ICC judges had previously determined through 'exhaustive review' that these reports did not reduce the alleged risks. The Prosecutor reiterated that the Rome Statute does not permit provisional release based on humanitarian grounds while detention justifications persist. It also noted that the defense failed to prove that detention caused serious harm. The Prosecutor strongly rejected claims by Duterte\u2019s lawyer that judges had predetermined the outcome, calling such allegations 'concerning' and rejecting them 'in the strongest terms.' Duterte, aged 80, was arrested in March 2025 in Manila and transferred to The Hague following an international arrest warrant issued for alleged crimes against humanity committed during the Philippines' 'war on drugs,' both during his presidency and as mayor of Davao.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 07:56 PM\nSource:[El Nacional](https://www.elnacional.com/2025/10/cpi-exige-mantener-detenido-a-rodrigo-duterte/)\n\n**Is the Current Situation in the Philippines Unfavorable for the Duterte Family?**\nThe political alliance between the Duterte family and President Ferdinand 'Bongbong' Marcos Jr. has collapsed amid escalating tensions in Mindanao, a traditional stronghold of the Duterte family. A violent conflict in a town near former rebel-controlled areas led to the evacuation of over 2,000 households, signaling a breakdown beyond a typical gang clash. The conflict is seen as a culmination of long-standing regional tensions. Initially, the two families formed a strategic alliance, with the Marcos family relying on Duterte\u2019s electoral support and political network to secure power. However, after consolidating authority, Marcos revoked the Duterte family\u2019s judicial immunity and reclaimed local fiscal powers, effectively nullifying their prior agreement. In response, Rodrigo Duterte publicly asserted that Mindanao should govern itself, while his son issued a more confrontational warning: if central government pressure continues, he is prepared to mobilize forces and break away. This rupture underscores the transactional nature of Philippine family politics, where alliances are based on mutual interest rather than loyalty. The Marcos administration\u2019s hardline approach is viewed as a strategic miscalculation, as the Duterte family\u2019s deep-rooted influence, extensive local networks, and control over regional resources make any attempt to displace them highly destabilizing.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 07:21 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20251031/48953924.html)\n\n**Duterte Appeals ICC Decision on Crimes Against Humanity Charges**\nRodrigo Duterte, former president of the Philippines, has appealed the International Criminal Court's (ICC) decision to proceed with a case against him, accusing him of crimes against humanity and involvement in hundreds of killings linked to his anti-drug campaign. The 80-year-old is currently detained in The Hague, Netherlands, where the ICC is headquartered, after being arrested in March 2025 at Manila\u2019s airport. The ICC judges ruled that the court has jurisdiction over the case despite Duterte\u2019s defense arguing that the investigation was not fully initiated before the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2019. Duterte\u2019s legal team has filed a motion seeking his release and another petition to dismiss the case, citing his cognitive decline. A decision on how his health affects the trial is expected in November 2025. Duterte faces three charges: (1) co-authorship of 19 murders during his tenure as mayor of Davao (1988\u20131998, 2001\u20132010, 2013\u20132016); (2) involvement in 14 high-value target assassinations in 2016\u20132017 while president; and (3) responsibility for 43 killings during 'clean-up operations' from 2016 to 2018, which prosecutors describe as systematic. The anti-drug campaign, which began in 2016, led to thousands of deaths, with police reporting 6,200 suspects killed and human rights groups citing far higher numbers. Duterte, who led the Philippines from 2016 to 2022, withdrew the country from the ICC treaty in 2019, but the court had already begun investigating alleged crimes under his leadership. He was arrested on March 11, 2025, and transferred to the ICC\u2019s penitentiary facility in Scheveningen, marking a dramatic shift for a leader once accustomed to operating without constraints.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 03:02 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2025/10/duterte-tenta-anular-processo-no-tpi-por-crimes-contra-a-humanidade.shtml)\n\n**The Philippines at a Crossroads: Disillusionment, Protest, and the Legacy of Violence Under Marcos Jr. and Duterte**\nJasmine, a 39-year-old resident of Manila, expresses disillusionment with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. (Bongbong), stating that insecurity has increased under his leadership. She contrasts this with the previous era of Rodrigo Duterte (2016\u20132022), whose 'iron fist' of intimidation, though brutal, effectively controlled crime, even if his economic policies were weak. Despite Bongbong's campaign promise to lower rice prices\u2014now broken\u2014protests erupted on September 21, 2025, following a flood protection scandal, leading to the arrest of 216 people, including a 12-year-old. Manila's Mayor Isko Moreno demanded cooperation from parents and sought to 'identify who stands behind the protests,' a rhetorical tactic often used in authoritarian-leaning democracies to imply foreign interference. Allegations of corruption in infrastructure projects (2023\u20132025) include inflated prices, kickbacks, 'ghost projects,' substandard construction, and budget manipulation, amounting to up to two billion euros in losses. Bongbong responded with promises of accountability and empathy, stating, 'If I weren\u2019t president, I might protest too.' This led to resignations, including that of his cousin, the Speaker of the House. Protests drew 50,000 to 150,000 demonstrators, many from Generation Z, who adopted a pirate flag (a skull with a straw hat)\u2014a symbol originating from the anime 'One Piece'\u2014also seen in protests in Nepal and Indonesia. This cultural borrowing reflects how youth in Asia use pop culture to express dissent, including gestures from 'Hunger Games' and 'Harry Potter.' The government announced it would not prosecute the arrested youth but assign them to community service, a move met with skepticism due to the lingering trauma of the Duterte era, during which extrajudicial killings were widespread and the police were complicit. Walter S., an Austrian resident married to a Filipino, describes Manila as 'totally depoliticized,' where people rely on social media rather than newspapers or books. Duterte, now an accused war criminal in The Hague since March 2025, was the founder of the notorious 'Davao Death Squad' and a proponent of neofascism. His rhetoric, including statements like 'Hitler killed three million Jews, here we have three million drug addicts\u2014I\u2019d be happy to slaughter them all,' and his use of the word 'kill' 2,154 times in his first six months, fueled a wave of state-sanctioned violence that resulted in an estimated 30,000 deaths. Despite claims of self-justification, the killings were systematic. The 'Philippine Daily Inquirer' documented these killings in a 'Kill List,' while journalist Patricia Evangelista, author of 'Some People Need Killing,' portrays a society desensitized to violence, where horror became routine and was met with applause. Evangelista, a trauma reporter, describes working in areas where death was commonplace. Duterte labeled 'Rappler,' the news outlet co-founded by Nobel laureate Maria Ressa, as 'fake news.' Walter S. notes that fear remains deeply embedded, with his in-laws avoiding political discussion. Duterte\u2019s radical violence was rooted in historical patterns of repression, including over 300 years of Spanish colonial rule and a brutal U.S. occupation that killed up to one million Filipinos. These colonial legacies entrenched elite clans and systemic violence. Evangelista reveals how Duterte exploited public apathy, framing the deaths of marginalized people as societal relief. The Philippines thus serves as a warning about how autocrats cultivate indifference to violence, particularly in an era where authoritarian regimes like those in the U.S. and Russia are increasingly dominant. In Europe, similar trends in disinformation are emerging. The article concludes with Walter S. acknowledging the Philippines\u2019 harsh realities\u2014long commutes, poverty, alcoholism\u2014but still calling it his ideal country due to its vast, undeveloped landscapes, natural resilience, and cultural calm.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 08:06 AM\nSource:[Die Presse](https://www.diepresse.com/20183627/es-heisst-die-philippiner-wuerden-sich-erst-auflehnen-wenn-die-steigen)\n\n**International Criminal Court denies release of ex-Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte**\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) denied an appeal for temporary release by former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on October 10, 2025. The pre-trial chamber issued a 23-page ruling based on a September 26 decision, citing concerns that Duterte poses a flight risk, could obstruct proceedings, or commit new crimes if released. Duterte, 80, was arrested in Manila in March 2025 on an ICC warrant related to alleged crimes against humanity during his 'war on drugs' from 2016 to 2022, which resulted in between 12,000 and 30,000 deaths. The ICC had launched a formal investigation in September 2021, prompting the Duterte administration to withdraw from the court in 2018. His legal team had proposed electronic monitoring and asylum in a third country as conditions for release. Victims' families urged the court to keep him detained. Despite this, Duterte was re-elected mayor of Davao City. His daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, threatened to 'break him out' of jail and accused the government of using 'fake' witnesses. Sara Duterte survived impeachment attempts in the summer of 2025.

The rift stems from corruption allegations against Sara Duterte, which she denies, failed impeachment efforts, and her public pledge to have Marcos assassinated if she dies prematurely. The breaking point came when Marcos Jr. facilitated the transfer of her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, where he is accused of crimes against humanity. While Marcos Sr. died in 1989, Rodrigo Duterte remains in custody. The escalating conflict has drawn international attention, particularly from Beijing and Washington, due to the Philippines' strategic position in the South China Sea and its shifting alignment between China and the West. Sara Duterte\u2019s renewed popularity in polls, despite the turmoil, raises concerns for the U.S., as she appears less committed to the U.S.-Philippines alliance and more open to a rapprochement with China.

A mass anti\u2011corruption protest on September 21, the anniversary of Marcos\u2019s declaration of martial law, drew more than 100,000 participants across Manila and other cities. The demonstration turned violent when masked youths clashed with riot police at the Yela Bridge, leading to 72 arrests, including minors, and the burning of several vehicles and public property. Police described the overall gathering as '\u57fa\u672c\u548c\u5e73' (basically peaceful). Meanwhile, Vice\u2011President Sara Duterte told Filipino expatriates in Japan that a 'third\u2011party country' had agreed to accept her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, through negotiations with 'foreign acquaintances', hinting that the country's stance could be seen on the International Criminal Court website. She did not name the country but ruled out Japan and noted that Australia had previously rejected the offer. The events add to the political pressure on Marcos, whose approval ratings are falling, and may prompt him to adopt more aggressive tactics on the South China Sea to divert domestic attention.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 11:53 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20250926/48858262.html)\n\n**ICC Finds Evidence Against Former Philippine President Duterte**\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has filed charges of crimes against humanity against former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, alleging his responsibility for at least 76 killings linked to the country\u2019s war on drugs. The indictment cites three categories of killings: 19 murders committed while Duterte was mayor of Davao (2013\u20112016), 14 deaths of so\u2011called \u2018high\u2011value targets\u2019 (2016\u20112017), and 43 killings during drug\u2011eradication operations (2016\u20112018). According to the ICC indictment, these deaths were the result of Duterte\u2019s orders or encouragement, making him personally liable. The article notes that the total number of deaths attributed to the drug war is far higher: 6,229 people died in operations from July\u202f2016 to January\u202f2022, 8,663 were recorded in the 2020 UN Human Rights Office report, and human\u2011rights groups estimate that death squads ordered by Duterte killed about 30,000 people. \n\nDuterte\u2019s own controversial statement in September\u202f2016\u2014\"In Germany Adolf Hitler killed 3\u202fmillion Jews. In the Philippines 3\u202fmillion drug addicts. I would gladly kill them\"\u2014is quoted to illustrate the severity of his campaign. The article also reports that after the ICC issued an arrest warrant on March\u202f11, 2024, Duterte was detained at Manila airport, flown to the Netherlands, and has since remained in the ICC\u2019s detention centre in Scheveningen. The indictment was filed in September\u202f2023, and the first hearing was postponed in September\u202f2024 to assess Duterte\u2019s fitness to stand trial.\n\nThe piece highlights that Duterte\u2019s supporters have long accused the investigation of being politically motivated, especially after the Philippines withdrew from the ICC in 2023. It also notes that several African and American states have criticized the ICC\u2019s focus on drug\u2011war crimes, labeling the court a tool of neo\u2011colonial repression.

The charges, released in a heavily redacted ICC charge sheet dated early July and signed by deputy prosecutor Mame Mandiaye Niang, cover murders that occurred between 2013 and 2018. The first count relates to his time as mayor of Davao City, where he is alleged to have been an 'indirect co\u2011perpetrator' in 19 murders from 2013 to 2016. The second count concerns 14 'high\u2011value' targets killed in 2016 and 2017, while the third count covers 43 murders committed during 'clearance' operations against lower\u2011level alleged criminals between 2016 and 2018. The 76 killings were carried out by police and non\u2011state actors such as hitmen, according to the ICC document. Duterte, 80, has been held in a detention facility in the Netherlands since March, following his arrest in Manila on March 11. The court has delayed his appearance, pending a fitness\u2011to\u2011stand\u2011trial assessment after his lawyer Nicholas Kaufman argued that Duterte suffers 'cognitive impairment in multiple domains' and should be indefinitely postponed.

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s coalition, the Philippine Federal Party (PFP), is expected to strengthen its national leadership, particularly in the Senate, where it is projected to secure at least half of the 12 available seats. The Senate race was more competitive, with strong performances from pro-Duterte candidates Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go and Ronald Dela Rosa, who received the highest votes. At the local level, political fragmentation emerged, with a notable rise in independent candidates and a significant showing by the progressive party Akbayan, which garnered 6.71% of votes (on 97.23% of ballots counted), surpassing the 2% threshold. The Duterte-aligned Duterte Youth party also exceeded expectations with 5.61% of the vote. In Davao City, the political stronghold of former President Rodrigo Duterte, his son Sebastian Duterte won second place as vice mayor, while Rodrigo Duterte Sr. himself, detained in The Hague since March 2025 on charges of crimes against humanity, received 660,000 votes despite being denied voting rights by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) due to non-registration abroad.

    "summary": "Across all experts, the consensus is that while risks of significant unrest or martial law in the Philippines for 2025 are notably elevated due to the high-profile arrest of Rodrigo Duterte, the split between the Duterte and Marcos camps, and ongoing regional tensions\u2014especially in Mindanao\u2014the likelihood of a 'Yes' resolution remains well below even odds. Key factors universally cited as raising risk include the Duterte-Marcos feud, potent elite-driven mobilization especially in Mindanao, and the symbolic impact of Duterte's ICC detention. However, experts stress that the historical base rate for martial law or major civil unrest on the required scale (1,000 deaths or 5,000 arrests, or any martial law declaration) is quite low, and recent precedents show unrest tends to be contained, often through targeted, not mass, repression. The government's security apparatus remains intact and mostly loyal to the central regime, while international scrutiny (especially given the ongoing ICC trial) creates disincentive for overt large-scale repression. Protest activity, though larger than average, has been met with measured state responses. No expert sees evidence to date of mass mobilization or violence reaching critical thresholds. Probabilities offered by experts range mostly between 12% and 28%, with most clustering near 13\u201318%. The experts' main divergence is along lines of how much weight to assign to the risk of escalation in Mindanao and the potential for sudden trigger events, but all view the status quo ('No') as the most likely outcome, with significant but moderate tail risks for regional martial law. In summary: the situation is tense and more dangerous than average, particularly regionally, but still most likely to resolve without reaching the criteria for major civil unrest or martial law in 2025.",
