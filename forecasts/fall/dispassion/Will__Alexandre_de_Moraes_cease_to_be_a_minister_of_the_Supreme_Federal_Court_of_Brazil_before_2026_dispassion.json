The STF's own internal solidarity and Brazilian legal tradition strongly discourage such removals.

Despite dozens of impeachment requests and continuous far-right opposition, none have advanced or appear likely to do so, especially with the right politically weakened and the left/center controlling legislative agendas. International criticism and sanctions have no practical legal effect on Moraes\u2019s tenure. His institutional support within the STF and across the broader judiciary remains strong. There are no credible ongoing investigations targeting him personally. The only non-negligible risks are truly unforeseen events (e.g., health, personal crisis), which have a very low probability given his age and absence of public risk factors. The base rate of STF justices ceasing office before retirement age is virtually zero in Brazil's modern democratic era. Therefore, the probability that Alexandre de Moraes will cease to be a minister of the Supreme Federal Court before 2026 is extremely low.",

The defendants, including F\u00e1bio Augusto Vieira (former general commander), Klepter Rosa Gon\u00e7alves (former deputy general commander), and five other officers, are accused of omission during the January 8, 2023, coup-related attacks on the three branches of government in Bras\u00edlia. The Procuradoria-Geral da Rep\u00fablica (PGR) alleges that the officers failed to reinforce security despite prior intelligence, allowing the invasions and destruction of government buildings to proceed unchecked. The PGR argues that the officers held a 'position of guarantor' under Brazilian constitutional and military law, obligating them to protect public order and the functioning of state institutions. Their inaction, according to the prosecution, constitutes criminal omission, making them liable for the same crimes committed by the attackers. The seven defendants are currently under strict judicial restrictions: they are on provisional release with electronic ankle monitors, prohibited from leaving the city, must report weekly, cannot travel abroad, have their firearms licenses suspended, are banned from social media, and cannot contact other suspects. The trial has been postponed twice before\u2014once in December 2023 and again in August 2024\u2014before being rescheduled. The defense denies all allegations, claiming insufficient evidence and asserting that no crime or misconduct occurred. The case is being heard by the STF\u2019s First Turma.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 10:28 PM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/df/distrito-federal/noticia/2025/11/07/moraes-marca-julgamento-da-ex-cupula-da-policia-militar-do-df-por-omissao-no-8-de-janeiro.ghtml)\n\n**Countdown at the STF for Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s 'D-Day' reaches final phase**\nThe Supreme Federal Court (STF) in Brazil has reached the final phase of its review of appeals filed by former President Jair Bolsonaro and other defendants in the so-called 'core group' of a coup plot. Relator Minister Alexandre de Moraes opened the voting on November 7, 2025, casting a vote that rejected all defense arguments and reaffirmed Bolsonaro\u2019s 27-year and 3-month prison sentence. Moraes reiterated that Bolsonaro led an 'armed criminal organization' aimed at restricting constitutional powers and attempting the violent overthrow of a legally constituted government. According to journalist Robson Bonin, no one within the STF or among defense lawyers believes the verdict will be reversed, calling the outcome 'a consolidated picture' with no possibility of reversal. With Minister Luiz Fux having been transferred to the Second Chamber, the decision now requires unanimous confirmation by four ministers. Jos\u00e9 Benedito da Silva of VEJA stated that Bolsonaro is experiencing his most politically fragile moment since the conviction, having lost political support even within the right-wing spectrum. The right has shifted focus to public security as a new mobilization platform, rendering Bolsonaro obsolete in street protests and social media influence. The previously discussed amnesty agenda has been abandoned, with no one now mentioning it. The defense\u2019s current strategy is to delay proceedings through procedural motions like declarations of clarification and dilatory appeals, potentially pushing the final judgment into the judicial recess from December to January 2026. This would aim to delay prison execution until the 2026 election year, when political conditions might favor Bolsonaro\u2014though such a move is deemed unlikely. Despite minimal chances, the STF is expected to confirm the sentence\u2019s enforcement this year. Bolsonaro is anticipated to serve a few days in closed regime, possibly at Papuda Prison in Bras\u00edlia, before obtaining house arrest due to health reasons, similar to Fernando Collor. 'It\u2019s a bad moment for Bolsonaro. Politically, he\u2019s weakened. Legally, there\u2019s no way out,' concluded Jos\u00e9 Benedito.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 04:21 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/politica/contagem-regressiva-no-stf-para-o-dia-d-de-jair-bolsonaro-chega-a-fase-final/)\n\n**Moraes Votes to Proceed with Criminal Case Against Former Advisor Tagliaferro for Leaking Messages**\nThe case concerning former TSE (Superior Electoral Court) advisor Tagliaferro, accused of leaking confidential messages, is under review by Brazil's Supreme Federal Court (STF) First Turma, led by Minister Alexandre de Moraes. The PGR (Public Prosecutor's Office) filed the indictment on August 19, 2024, alleging that Tagliaferro, while in office, leaked secret communications to the press to discredit ongoing investigations and hinder the STF's work. After leaving Brazil, he reportedly threatened to release further confidential data in foreign interviews, aiming to intimidate authorities. Moraes rejected all defense motions to annul the process, stating that Tagliaferro's actions were not mere criticism but part of a coordinated plan to weaken the STF and TSE, promote democratic instability, and undermine the rule of law. He emphasized that the conduct transcended legitimate critique and constituted instrumentalization for antidemocratic ends, including attempts to violently abolish the State of Law. The vote on whether to accept the indictment is ongoing, with three ministers\u2014Cristiano Zanin, Fl\u00e1vio Dino, and C\u00e1rmen L\u00facia\u2014yet to vote. Luiz Fux has left the Turma and cannot vote; the replacement for Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso has not been appointed in time for this case. The virtual plenary session will conclude on November 14, 2025. If the indictment is accepted, a criminal proceeding will be opened against Tagliaferro, though no judgment on guilt or innocence has been made at this stage. The defense, represented by Eduardo Kuntz, argues that no concrete conduct amounting to 'grave threat'\u2014a required element for the charge of coercion in legal proceedings\u2014was proven.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 03:40 PM\nSource:[UOL  not\u00edcias](https://noticias.uol.com.br/politica/ultimas-noticias/2025/11/07/moraes-aceita-denuncia-contra-ex-assessor-por-vazamento-de-dados-sigilosos.htm)\n\n**Moraes Upholds Bolsonaro's Conviction and Expands Case Against Ex-TSE Advisor**\nMinister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) voted to deny the appeal filed by former President Jair Bolsonaro's defense against his 27-year-and-3-month prison sentence for allegedly attempting a coup after the 2022 elections. The appeal, an 'embargo de declara\u00e7\u00e3o', sought to correct omissions or contradictions in the original ruling, but Moraes rejected it, stating no such flaws existed. The virtual plenary session of the First Turma, which runs until November 14, also saw Moraes rule to make Eduardo Tagliaferro, former TSE advisor, a defendant in a case involving the leak of confidential information and obstruction of investigations into anti-democratic acts. Tagliaferro, currently in Italy, is subject to extradition proceedings. The Public Prosecutor's Office (PGR) alleges he supported a criminal organization spreading disinformation about the electoral system and institutions. Additionally, the defense of Filipe Martins, former international advisor to Bolsonaro, accused Federal Police delegate F\u00e1bio Shor of evidence manipulation, claiming the PF's narrative about Martins' alleged false U.S. entry was 'factually false, documentally refuted, and motivated by bad faith', and that Martins' preventive detention was illegal and abusive. They requested that Moraes nullify the new investigation and initiate disciplinary action against the delegate. During the 'Gilmarpalooza' event in Argentina, a Brazilian fugitive publicly accused Moraes of political persecution, claiming he sentenced citizens to up to 17 years without concrete evidence of involvement in the January 8, 2023, attacks on government buildings. The protest led to the event's interruption and the man's removal by security. Two other fugitives were also present and identified by name.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 03:31 PM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/sem-rodeios/moraes-mantem-a-condenacao-de-bolsonaro/)\n\n**PL in Santa Catarina Fractures Over Senate Race Amid National Political Tensions**\nThe confirmation of Carlos Bolsonaro's pre-candidacy for the Senate in Santa Catarina for the 2026 elections has triggered a rift within the local branch of the PL (Liberal Party). The internal conflict involves federal deputy Caroline de Toni, who threatens to leave the party if not included in the Senate slate. Governor Jorginho Mello, a Bolsonaro ally, supports keeping incumbent senator Esperidi\u00e3o Amin on the ticket, while former president Jair Bolsonaro pushes for his son. Public clashes among allies have intensified, and De Toni is reportedly in talks with the Novo party to switch affiliations to preserve her candidacy. The dispute highlights divisions over loyalty to Bolsonarismo, regional prominence, and electoral strategy, with local leaders criticizing Carlos Bolsonaro\u2019s nomination\u2014based in Rio de Janeiro\u2014as an external imposition, arguing that Senate seats should be held by candidates with 'Santa Catarina DNA.' Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes ruled that a request by the Federal District Penitentiary Administration to assess Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s medical condition be removed from the trial file investigating the attempted coup. Moraes deemed the request impertinent and ordered its removal from the case, which is nearing final judgment. The request had the potential to open the door to alternative prison regimes, such as house arrest or hospitalization, after Bolsonaro was sentenced to 27 years in prison for crimes including attempted coup, armed criminal organization, and damage to public property. On the international front, Eduardo Tagliaferro, former TSE advisor, faces a critical extradition hearing on November 17, 2025, at the Catanzaro Court of Appeal in Italy. The hearing was prompted by a request from STF Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who accuses Tagliaferro of violating official secrecy by leaking messages that allegedly reveal misconduct by Moraes. Italy\u2019s judiciary will assess whether the acts constitute a crime under Article 326 of the Italian Penal Code (revelation of official secrets), while the defense claims political persecution and bias, as Moraes is both victim and judge. The hearing will also evaluate whether the process respects fundamental rights, which may influence the extradition decision. In the Senate, the opposition plans to use the newly established CPI on Organized Crime as a platform to argue that right-wing governed states\u2014such as Paran\u00e1, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul, and the Federal District\u2014are safer. Despite the federal government leading the CPI under Senator Fabiano Contarato (PT-ES), senators Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro (PL-RJ) and Hamilton Mour\u00e3o (Republicans-RS) are actively inviting governors and security secretaries from low-violence states to testify. The strategy aims to contrast these states with left-wing governed ones like Bahia and Cear\u00e1, which have higher violence rates, to promote the claim that right-wing security policies are more effective. The CPI will also hear from federal and state authorities and investigate the operations of criminal factions and militias nationwide. The program 'Sem Rodeios' on November 6, 2025, will feature state deputy Ana Campagnolo (PL-SC), Tagliaferro\u2019s lawyer with updates on the Italian case, and pastor Silas Malafaia for a frank political discussion.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 04:08 PM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/sem-rodeios/divisao-do-pl-em-sc-acirra-disputa-ao-senado/)\n\n**Moraes Schedules Trial of Former DF Military Police Leadership for Omission in January 8 Attacks**\nMinister Alexandre de Moraes of the Supreme Federal Court (STF) has scheduled the trial of seven former senior officers of the Federal District Military Police (PMDF) for the period between November 25 and December 5, 2025.

She presented documents indicating prior knowledge of potential unrest and described the situation as 'a diabolical plot' aimed at arresting former President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of innocent people, including Nelci, Rom\u00e1rio, Daniel Bressan, Lucio, M\u00e1rio, and Erick. She emphasized that these individuals were allowed to travel to Bras\u00edlia and gather peacefully at Pra\u00e7a dos Tr\u00eas Poderes, only to be criminalized, with their lives and families destroyed. Telles stated that 'thousands of lives have been destroyed due to a narrative.' She urged lawmakers to pass amnesty within 56 days, noting the approaching end of the year and the upcoming Christmas season. She described the emotional toll of the work, citing personal distress from receiving desperate messages from detainees and their families, many of whom are destitute and have blocked bank accounts. She launched the campaign 'If not scheduled, we won\u2019t vote,' warning that in the 2026 elections, indifferent lawmakers would not be re-elected. She condemned silence among deputies and senators, asserting that 'justice no longer exists for them, but there is a Congress that should stand up.' The article details a broader pattern in Brazil\u2019s legal system where individuals are treated as sub-citizens and sub-humans due to expressing support for Bolsonaro, facing arbitrary judicial measures including secret investigations, asset seizures, privacy violations, and political imprisonment. It criticizes the use of 'fishing expeditions' by Moraes, where investigators conduct broad, invasive searches to find grounds for accusation, violating due process.

The trial will be conducted by the First Turma in a virtual plenary session, where ministers will vote without in-person debate. The Procurator-General's Office (PGR) indicted Eduardo Bolsonaro and influencer Paulo Figueiredo in September for attempting to pressure Brazilian authorities through U.S. sanctions, allegedly disrupting the trial that led to former President Jair Bolsonaro's 27-year-and-three-month prison sentence. Figueiredo's case has been separated and lacks a scheduled date. Eduardo Bolsonaro is represented by the Union Public Defender's Office (DPU), appointed by Minister Alexandre de Moraes after Eduardo failed to appoint legal counsel. The DPU submitted a defense requesting dismissal of the indictment, arguing the process is null due to improper notification. The DPU claimed that under the Brazilian Code of Criminal Procedure (CPP), notification via letter rogatory is required when the accused is abroad, which was denied by Moraes, who instead opted for notification by public notice (edital). The DPU contended that physical absence abroad does not constitute 'creating difficulties' for service, as required by Article 368 of the CPP, and that using edital in such cases undermines the law. The DPU also requested suspension of the process and deadlines if Eduardo remains unresponsive, to protect his right to defense. The defense argued that the indictment lacks specificity, fails to prove violence or grave threat\u2014key elements for coercion\u2014and that Eduardo's public statements about U.S. sanctions, political consequences, and criticism of Brazilian authorities constitute political expression, not coercion. The DPU emphasized that such criticism, made in public and within the democratic process, should be protected under constitutional rights to free expression and political pluralism, and that criminalizing political speech violates fundamental rights.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 06:28 PM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/politica/noticia/2025/11/03/stf-antecipa-julgamento-de-denuncia-contra-eduardo-bolsonaro.ghtml)\n\n**Federal Police Investigate Pernambuco Attorney\u2019s Social Media Posts Criticizing Lula, Janja, and Supreme Court Justice**\nThe Federal Police (PF) is investigating attorney Thomas Cris\u00f3stomo from Pernambuco, authorized by Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski, over social media posts from 2023 that criticized and mocked President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, First Lady Janja, and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The investigation, ongoing in the Federal Justice of Recife, assesses whether the posts constitute a crime against honor. Cris\u00f3stomo called for Moraes\u2019s impeachment and referred to the state-owned EBC as a 'job placement for the wife of a former convict,' a reference to Janja. He argues that his posts were protected criticism and that it is 'absurd' for the state to investigate tweets with minimal reach and no real offense. The Federal Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office concluded that Cris\u00f3stomo committed the crime of defamation against Lula, citing the use of the term 'ex-presidi\u00e1rio' as an intentional affront to the president\u2019s dignity and offering a non-prosecution agreement. The prosecutor, Polireda Madaly Bezerra de Medeiros, stated that freedom of expression cannot be used as a shield for clearly humiliating and damaging remarks about others.

The STF demanded formal explanations from the Rio de Janeiro government and sent Minister Alexandre de Moraes to personally hear Castro. Minister Edson Fachin labeled the situation a 'grave tragedy.' The crisis followed a major police operation in Rio, prompting international attention, including criticism from a lawyer linked to U.S. President Donald Trump and comments from Colombian President Gustavo Petro. The opposition called for the resignation of the Federal Police (PF) director, and Deputy Lindbergh Farias requested Castro's removal before the STF. The Superior Electoral Court (TSE) scheduled a hearing that could annul Castro's mandate. Governor Tarc\u00edsio de Freitas of S\u00e3o Paulo expressed solidarity with Castro. Federal Minister of Justice Ricardo Lewandowski stated there is 'no silver bullet' against crime. President Lula sanctioned a bill authored by Senator Sergio Moro, toughening penalties against organized crime. The STF ordered the execution of Deputy Carla Zambelli\u2019s sentence for threatening a man with a firearm in 2022. Minister Alexandre de Moraes denied Gustavo Gayer\u2019s request to visit former President Jair Bolsonaro and suspended a criminal proceeding against him. Former aide Mauro Cid began serving his sentence under an open regime and may soon remove his electronic ankle monitor. Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco was cited in an investigation into illegal mining, which was referred to the STF. The STF also ruled that the state must compensate for material damages caused by police during protests. The federal government\u2019s fiscal deficit surpassed R$ 100 billion in 2025, according to the National Treasury.

Gayer had become a defendant in November 2024 after a decision by the STF's First Chamber. In a ruling dated October 28, 2025, Moraes ordered the immediate suspension of the criminal case and the suspension of the prescription period while Gayer remains in office. Moraes cited Article 53, \u00a7\u00a7 3\u00ba and 5\u00ba, of the Brazilian Constitution and referenced Resolution No. 30 of 2025 issued by the Chamber of Deputies. The complaint was filed by Senator Vanderlan Cardoso (PSD-GO) after Gayer, in a video posted on February 1, 2023, called Cardoso a 'vagabond' and accused him of 'turning his back on the people' by supporting Rodrigo Pacheco\u2019s re-election as Senate President in exchange for positions. Gayer stated in the video: 'Never have we seen such a rotten system campaigning for a Senate presidency candidate, and as a result, Pacheco leading the Senate will continue to bend over for the STF to keep inserting its authoritarian cock. Sorry for the words, but that\u2019s the truth and the best description of what\u2019s happening.'

Moraes, who served as President of the Superior Electoral Court in 2022, has led a series of investigations and criminal actions against Bolsonaro and his supporters, including a 2023 order that required Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle\u2011band and later granted him house arrest.  The piece traces Moraes\u2019s rise to prominence back to March\u202f2019, when then\u2011STF President Dias\u202fToffoli opened a \u201cfake\u2011news\u201d inquiry into false information targeting the court; Toffoli appointed Moraes as rapporteur, a decision later upheld by the STF with a 10\u2011to\u20111 vote in 2020.  From that first case, the \u201crule of prevention\u201d\u2014which requires a single judge to handle related investigations\u2014has kept Moraes at the helm of subsequent probes, such as the 2020 anti\u2011democratic acts, the digital militia inquiry, the January\u202f8 attacks on federal buildings, and investigations into alleged foreign influence involving Eduardo\u202fBolsonaro and Elon\u202fMusk.  Moraes\u2019s monocratic decisions, including the ankle\u2011band and house\u2011arrest orders, were confirmed by the First Chamber of the STF 4\u2011to\u20111, with Luiz\u202fFux dissenting.  The article notes that Moraes has faced criticism from political and legal circles: a 2024 editorial in *The Economist* called his enthusiasm \u201calarmante,\u201d and the Progressive Party filed two lawsuits in 2024 challenging his handling of cases, both of which were dismissed.  He has also been the subject of about 30 impeachment requests, the most recent filed by Senator\u202fFl\u00e1vio\u202fBolsonaro in July\u202f2024.  The piece concludes that while Moraes\u2019s actions are legally grounded, they have sparked accusations of political bias and potential infringement on fundamental rights.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 05:52 PM\nSource:[\u00daltimo Segundo](https://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/agencias/dw/2025-09-03/por-que-moraes-concentra-as-decisoes-sobre-bolsonaro-.html)\n\n**Brazil: Who is Alexandre de Moraes, the Judge Leading the Case Against Jair Bolsonaro**\nAlexandre de Moraes, born 13\u202fDecember\u202f1968 in S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo, is a constitutional\u2011law specialist who joined Brazil\u2019s Supreme Federal Court (STF) in 2017 after being nominated by former President Michel Temer. He served as S\u00e3o\u202fPaulo\u2019s Secretary of Security from 2015\u20112016, during which left\u2011wing groups accused him of repressing social movements; today they praise him as a defender of democracy against President Jair\u202fBolsonaro\u2019s 2019\u20112022 administration. In 2023, under Moraes\u2019s leadership, the electoral court sentenced Bolsonaro to eight years of political ineligibility for spreading misinformation ahead of the 2022 election, in which Bolsonaro lost to Luiz\u202fIn\u00e1cio\u202fLula\u202fda\u202fSilva. Conservative sectors label Moraes a \u201cdictator\u201d and a \u201cscoundrel,\u201d and Elon\u202fMusk compared him to Voldemort. In 2024, a confrontation between the judge and Musk led to a 40\u2011day suspension of the social\u2011media platform X after the judge ordered the removal of false news. Moraes replied, \u2018Libertad de expresi\u00f3n no es libertad de agresi\u00f3n,\u2019 to those who accused him of censorship. He now heads the case that could determine Bolsonaro\u2019s future; the former president faces a possible sentence of up to 43\u202fyears in prison for allegedly leading a 2022 plan to block Lula\u2019s inauguration, including a plot to assassinate Moraes. Recent weeks saw stricter measures against Bolsonaro, such as a preventive house arrest for alleged judicial obstruction. Despite rumors of divisions within the STF, senior justice Gilmar\u202fMendes publicly defended Moraes, saying, \u2018Cualquier ataque contra uno de nosotros es un ataque contra la corte,\u2019 describing his colleague\u2019s role as \u201chist\u00f3rico.\u201d Moraes is married with three children and can remain on the Supreme Court until age\u202f75.

The article describes Moraes\u2019 campaign against online disinformation, including a high\u2011profile clash with Musk that led to the temporary suspension of X, and his criticism of the platform\u2019s refusal to block accounts spreading \u201cdemocracy\u2011enemy\u201d content.

The article concludes by noting that while many praise Moraes for his uncompromising stance, others criticize his use of extraordinary powers, house searches, travel bans, and extended prison sentences, arguing that the Supreme Court\u2019s expanded authority in 2022 has blurred the line between judge and investigator.

    "summary": "Expert forecasts from diverse backgrounds\u2014constitutional law, judicial administration, political science, judicial doctrine, and Brazilian political institutions\u2014overwhelmingly predict that Alexandre de Moraes will NOT cease to be a minister of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil before January 1, 2026. All experts highlight the exceptionally strong constitutional and institutional protections afforded to STF ministers: impeachment is legally possible but has never succeeded in the post-1988 democratic era and requires extremely high political consensus. The current Brazilian Senate leadership shows no inclination to advance any impeachment against Moraes, and the overall political environment, while highly polarized, is shaped by a fragmented and weakened opposition. The ongoing domestic and international criticism\u2014including high-profile figures like Elon Musk and the imposition of US sanctions\u2014are widely seen as having little practical effect on Moraes\u2019s tenure. The STF as an institution, along with its leadership, remains united in support of Moraes, reinforcing elite solidarity against perceived threats. Experts note that health crises or unforeseen personal scandal could theoretically force an early exit, but there is currently no public evidence of such risks, and base rates for such events are very low for someone of Moraes's age. While the continued stream of impeachment requests and international criticism marginally raise the probability from a strict historical base rate, all forecasts converge on a final probability between 2%-5% for Moraes leaving office before 2026, with most clustered at or below 4%. Thus, the scenario in which Moraes remains in office\u2014presiding over major cases and weathering intense criticism\u2014is deemed far more likely than any scenario where he is removed or resigns within the timeframe.",
