    "news": "Here are the relevant news articles:\n\n**China Accuses Tokyo of Resurrecting 'Japanese Militarism' Over Taiwan Intervention Remarks**\nThe official Communist Party of China newspaper, People's Daily, warned of a 'dangerous resurgence of Japanese militarism' following statements by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about potential Japanese intervention in a conflict across the Taiwan Strait. Under the pseudonym Zhong Sheng, the newspaper labeled Takaichi's remarks as evidence of Japan's 'ambitions to revive military expansion' and described them as 'extremely perverse intentions' revealing the 'obsession and arrogance' of Japan's right-wing forces to break constitutional pacifist constraints and pursue great-power military status. The article accused Tokyo of 'recklessly accelerating its rearmament path' and attempting to use a 'potential contingency in Taiwan' as a pretext for military expansion. It drew historical parallels, questioning whether Japan intends to repeat past mistakes by invoking 'existential crises' to justify invasions. The article warned that any Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan Strait would be considered an 'aggression' by China, prompting a 'direct strike' in response, and urged Tokyo to 'immediately correct its provocative conduct' and 'retract harmful statements' or face 'all consequences.' The statement followed a formal protest by China's Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, who summoned Japanese ambassador Kenji Kanasugi. Takaichi stated in parliament that a crisis in Taiwan could place Japan in a 'crisis situation,' justifying intervention by the Japan Self-Defense Forces under collective self-defense principles. Taiwan, which has self-governance since 1949, is claimed by China as an 'independent province' and integral territory, with Beijing having repeatedly threatened military force to achieve reunification. Although Japan recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government in 1972, it maintains unofficial relations with Taipei, and former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (1954\u20132022) publicly supported military response to any invasion of Taiwan under the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Tensions escalated further after the Chinese consul in Osaka, Xue Jian, posted and later deleted a social media message calling for 'cutting off Takaichi's head,' prompting a formal diplomatic complaint from Japan.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 06:48 AM\nSource:[SAPO](https://sapo.pt/artigo/taiwan-pequim-acusa-toquio-de-ressuscitar-militarismo-japones-6916d07552458d50e6b96d90)\n\n**People's Daily: Gao Shi Zaomiao's Taiwan Remarks Are Extremely Sinister, Offensive, and Dangerous**\nOn November 14, 2025, the People's Daily published a commentary titled 'We Will Not Tolerate Gao Shi Zaomiao's Provocative Actions on the Taiwan Issue.' The article strongly condemned Japanese Prime Minister Gao Shi Zaomiao for asserting in the Diet that 'Taiwan's crisis' could constitute a 'national survival crisis' justifying Japan's collective self-defense rights, implying potential military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. The People's Daily labeled her remarks as 'extremely sinister in intent, extremely\u6076\u52a3 in nature, and extremely serious in consequences.' The commentary emphasized that this marks the first time since Japan's 1945 defeat that a Japanese leader has formally linked Taiwan's crisis to collective self-defense, signaling a clear ambition for armed intervention and a direct threat to China. It recalled Japan's colonial rule of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945 under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, including brutal suppression and resource plunder, and affirmed that the 1945 victory of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance against Japan led to Japan's formal surrender and the return of Taiwan to Chinese sovereignty under international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. The article stressed that as a defeated power, Japan must reflect on its historical responsibilities and uphold its commitments to the one-China principle. Gao's linkage of Taiwan to Japan's security undermines the 2008 China-Japan political document stating mutual non-threat and breaches the core of the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement. The commentary warned that her remarks reflect Japan's right-wing forces' ambition to break the pacifist constitution, pursue military power, and abandon the 'three non-nuclear principles.' It condemned her actions as part of a pattern of revising history, including visits to Yasukuni Shrine, denial of the Nanjing Massacre, and amplifying the 'China threat' narrative. The article warned that Japan's invocation of 'survival crisis' echoes its past imperial justifications for aggression, such as the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, and warned against repeating history. It reaffirmed that national reunification is an unstoppable historical trend, and that any attempt to interfere in Taiwan will be met with resolute resistance. The People's Daily concluded with a warning: any military intervention by Japan would constitute aggression, and China will respond forcefully; Japan must immediately retract its remarks and cease dangerous military moves, or bear full responsibility for the consequences.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 02:04 AM\nSource:[QQ\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5fc3](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20251114A00VLQ00)\n\n**Tensions Rise in Asia: China's Firm Response to Japan's Taiwan Remarks**\nChina has issued a firm response to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takai\u00e7i's remarks suggesting Japan might use military force in the event of a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian stated that any such intervention by Japan would be considered an 'aggressive act' and that China would respond with force. Lin emphasized China's commitment to exercising its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law, reaffirming the protection of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. He urged Japan to immediately retract its statements, warning it would have to bear the consequences if it did not. Lin also questioned whether Takai\u00e7i\u2019s invocation of a 'national existence crisis' scenario signaled a return to Japan\u2019s past military aggression, accusing Japan of attempting to undermine the post-war international order. Takai\u00e7i had previously described a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait as a threat to Japan\u2019s existence under Japan\u2019s 2015 National Security Law, which permits the use of armed forces in response to attacks on allies that threaten Japan\u2019s survival. While Japan\u2019s leadership has previously protested China\u2019s objections, Takai\u00e7i maintained that his remarks were hypothetical and that he would avoid such statements in the future, but refused to retract them. The article also provides historical context: Taiwan was under Japanese control from 1895 to 1945 following the First Sino-Japanese War, after which it was handed over to the Allied Powers. Following the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party established the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, while the defeated Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, claiming to continue the Republic of China. Since 1949, Taiwan has functioned as a de facto independent entity. China continues to assert the 'One China' principle, opposes Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic recognition by other nations, and demands that countries sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. In recent years, China has increased military pressure on Taiwan, explicitly stating it would not rule out the use of force to achieve reunification.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:58 PM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/asyada-gerilim-artiyor-cinden-japonyaya-sert-yanit-979866h.htm)\n\n**China Warns Japan: Military Intervention in Taiwan Strait Would Trigger Forceful Response**\nOn November 13, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian condemned Japanese Prime Minister Asahi Hayato's remarks during a parliamentary session on November 7, in which she stated that a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait could constitute a 'national survival crisis' for Japan. Lin Jian emphasized that such statements violate the one-China principle, breach the spirit of the four joint political documents between China and Japan, and contravene basic norms of international relations. He warned that if Japan resorts to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait, China will 'strike back forcefully' and exercise its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Lin Jian underscored that Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and resolving the Taiwan issue is an internal matter for China, not subject to external interference. He questioned Japan's motives, drawing historical parallels to Japan's militarist past, including the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, and warned that repeating such rhetoric risks undermining post-war international order and damaging Sino-Japanese relations. Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao also denounced the claim on X, stating that promoting 'Taiwan's crisis is Japan's crisis' seeks to drag Japan into a path of splitting China, which would lead to an irreversible and dangerous course. The Japanese 'survival crisis' doctrine, as defined by the 2015 revised security laws, allows Japan to exercise collective self-defense and take military action without prior U.S. approval if a foreign country under close ties is attacked and the threat is deemed to endanger Japan's survival, effectively including Taiwan in that category.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 09:14 AM\nSource:[guancha.cn](https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2025_11_13_796879.shtml)\n\n**China Condemns Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi's Remarks on Taiwan, Warns of Self-Defense Response to Military Intervention**\nChina's Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi for her remarks in the Diet on November 10, 2024, in which she stated that 'Taiwan's crisis could constitute a national survival crisis for Japan,' allowing Japan to exercise collective self-defense. According to the Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, Takaichi made these provocative statements about Taiwan's security despite China's formal protests and continued to refuse to retract them. China reiterated that any Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan Strait would be considered an act of aggression, and China would respond with decisive force, firmly exercising its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law. Lin Jian emphasized Japan\u2019s historical responsibility, recalling its colonial rule over Taiwan and its past use of 'national survival crisis' as a pretext for aggression, including the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, which caused immense suffering. He questioned whether Takaichi\u2019s current rhetoric signals a revival of Japanese militarism and a challenge to the post-World War II international order. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also reaffirmed that Taiwan is a sovereign state, with its sovereignty belonging to all Taiwanese people, and that the People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan\u2014this is a widely recognized international fact. China warned Japan against interfering in its internal affairs, calling such actions a manifestation of hegemonic behavior and a threat to global stability. The statement concluded with a warning: 'Those who play with fire will be burned.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 08:58 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/acn/202511130285.aspx)\n\n**First U.S. Military Sale to Taiwan Under Trump's Second Term**\nThe United States approved a $330 million military sale to Taiwan, marking the first such transaction since President Donald Trump took office in January 2025. The package includes non-standard components, spare parts, repair supplies, and support for F-16, C-130, and Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense stated the sale will enhance Taiwan's ability to address current and future threats by maintaining the operational readiness of its air fleet. The Pentagon emphasized that the delivery will strengthen Taiwan's air defenses, improve resilience, and bolster its capacity to respond to Chinese incursions in the 'gray zone.' Taiwan's Ministry of Defense confirmed the sale is expected to take effect within one month. Taiwan's presidential office, through spokesperson Karen Kuo, called the deepening U.S.-Taiwan security alliance a 'fundamental pillar for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.' China strongly condemned the sale, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stating that Taiwan is a core interest for China and a 'red line' in U.S.-China relations. China regularly conducts military missions near Taiwan, which Taipei labels 'gray zone' activities\u2014pressuring but not escalating to direct combat. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force; Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and asserts that only its people can decide its future. Trump claimed that Xi Jinping assured him Taiwan would not be invaded during his presidency. The sale follows a high-stakes meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea aimed at securing a trade deal. Prior to the meeting, concerns in Taipei had risen that Trump might sacrifice Taiwan's interests for a China deal. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te has pledged to increase defense spending amid sustained Chinese military pressure. Although the U.S. does not formally recognize Taiwan as a state, it remains its largest arms supplier and is legally obligated to provide defensive capabilities under the Taiwan Relations Act. Taiwan has a domestic defense industry but remains heavily reliant on U.S. arms, as its military would be decisively outmatched in a conflict with China.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 08:52 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/es/ee-uu-aprueba-primera-venta-militar-a-taiw%C3%A1n-del-segundo-gobierno-de-trump/a-74740145)\n\n**China Accuses Tokyo of Resurrecting 'Japanese Militarism' Over Taiwan Intervention Remarks**\nThe official Communist Party of China newspaper, People's Daily, warned of a 'dangerous resurgence of Japanese militarism' following statements by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about potential Japanese intervention in a conflict across the Taiwan Strait. Under the pseudonym Zhong Sheng, the newspaper labeled Takaichi's remarks as evidence of Japan's 'ambitions to revive military expansion' and described them as 'extremely perverse intentions' revealing the 'obsession and arrogance' of Japan's right-wing forces to break constitutional pacifist constraints and pursue great-power military status. The article accused Tokyo of 'recklessly accelerating its rearmament path' and attempting to use a 'potential contingency in Taiwan' as a pretext for military expansion. It drew historical parallels, questioning whether Japan intends to repeat past mistakes by invoking 'existential crises' to justify invasions. The article warned that any Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan Strait would be considered an 'aggression' by China, prompting a 'direct strike' in response, and urged Tokyo to 'immediately correct its provocative conduct' and 'retract harmful statements' or face 'all consequences.' The statement followed a formal protest by China's Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, who summoned Japanese ambassador Kenji Kanasugi. Takaichi stated in parliament that a crisis in Taiwan could place Japan in a 'crisis situation,' justifying intervention by the Japan Self-Defense Forces under collective self-defense principles. Taiwan, which has self-governance since 1949, is claimed by China as an 'independent province' and integral territory, with Beijing having repeatedly threatened military force to achieve reunification. Although Japan recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government in 1972, it maintains unofficial relations with Taipei, and former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (1954\u20132022) publicly supported military response to any invasion of Taiwan under the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Tensions escalated further after the Chinese consul in Osaka, Xue Jian, posted and later deleted a social media message calling for 'cutting off Takaichi's head,' prompting a formal diplomatic complaint from Japan.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 06:48 AM\nSource:[SAPO](https://sapo.pt/artigo/taiwan-pequim-acusa-toquio-de-ressuscitar-militarismo-japones-6916d07552458d50e6b96d90)\n\n**U.S. Approves $330 Million Arms Sale to Taiwan**\nThe U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) announced late Thursday that the United States has approved a potential sale to Taiwan of aircraft spare parts and maintenance equipment worth $330 million, marking the first such proposed deal since Donald Trump assumed the presidency in January. According to a Pentagon statement, the proposed sale would enhance Taiwan's ability to address current and future threats by maintaining the operational readiness of its fleet of F-16 and C-130 aircraft and others. China claims Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to regain control. Taiwan's government strongly opposes Beijing's sovereignty claims, asserting that only the people of Taiwan can decide their own future. President Donald Trump stated that Chinese President Xi Jinping informed him that China would not invade Taiwan during Trump's presidency. The announcement follows a meeting between Trump and Xi in late October in South Korea, aimed at reaching a trade agreement. The U.S. maintains formal diplomatic relations with China while preserving unofficial ties with Taiwan, which remains its primary arms supplier. Prior to the meeting, concerns in Taipei had emerged over the possibility of Trump compromising Taiwan\u2019s interests in favor of Beijing.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0641\u062f](https://www.alwafd.news/5735589)\n\n**China Escalates Response to Japanese PM\u2019s Taiwan Remarks, 'Sentences' Takaichi to Political Death**\nChina's Foreign Ministry, through spokesperson Lin Jian, escalated its response to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's statement that 'Taiwan's crisis is Japan's crisis' and potential Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. On November 13, 2025, Lin Jian issued four sharp questions, warning that any Japanese military involvement would constitute an 'aggression' and would be met with a 'thunderous counterattack.' This characterization of Japan's actions as 'aggression' is highly unusual and evokes historical references to Japan's 1931\u20131945 invasion of China, including the 1894 Sino-Japanese War. The tone shifted from the November 10 'three questions'\u2014focused on asserting China\u2019s sovereignty and condemning Japan\u2019s interference\u2014to a direct warning: 'those who play with fire will burn themselves.' On November 13, Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong formally summoned Japanese Ambassador Kimbashi Kenji to deliver a stern protest. On November 14, the People's Daily published a scathing editorial titled 'We Will Not Tolerate Sanae Takaichi\u2019s Dangerous Provocations on Taiwan,' labeling her remarks as the first time a Japanese leader has explicitly linked Taiwan's crisis to collective self-defense rights, thus revealing Japan\u2019s military ambitions. The editorial condemned her actions as 'extremely sinister, extremely vicious, and extremely serious,' using the rare triple 'extremely'\u2014a rhetorical signal often associated with severe consequences in official Chinese discourse. The editorial further accused Takaichi of stepping on the 'footprints of historical crimes,' including visits to Yasukuni Shrine, denial of the Nanjing Massacre, and stoking 'China threat' narratives, and warned that her statements reflect a broader trend of Japan undermining the peace constitution, abandoning 'exclusive defense,' and seeking a 'military power' status\u2014posing a 'dangerous sign' of militarism\u2019s resurgence. The article concludes that Takaichi\u2019s actions have effectively been politically condemned by Beijing, with the metaphor of being 'sentenced to political death' being justified given the severity and historical weight of the response.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 05:05 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8oGyQmHoXTl)\n\n**People's Daily: Gao Shi Zaomiao's Taiwan Remarks Are Extremely Sinister, Offensive, and Dangerous**\nOn November 14, 2025, the People's Daily published a commentary titled 'We Will Not Tolerate Gao Shi Zaomiao's Provocative Actions on the Taiwan Issue.' The article strongly condemned Japanese Prime Minister Gao Shi Zaomiao for asserting in the Diet that 'Taiwan's crisis' could constitute a 'national survival crisis' justifying Japan's collective self-defense rights, implying potential military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. The People's Daily labeled her remarks as 'extremely sinister in intent, extremely\u6076\u52a3 in nature, and extremely serious in consequences.' The commentary emphasized that this marks the first time since Japan's 1945 defeat that a Japanese leader has formally linked Taiwan's crisis to collective self-defense, signaling a clear ambition for armed intervention and a direct threat to China. It recalled Japan's colonial rule of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945 under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, including brutal suppression and resource plunder, and affirmed that the 1945 victory of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance against Japan led to Japan's formal surrender and the return of Taiwan to Chinese sovereignty under international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. The article stressed that as a defeated power, Japan must reflect on its historical responsibilities and uphold its commitments to the one-China principle. Gao's linkage of Taiwan to Japan's security undermines the 2008 China-Japan political document stating mutual non-threat and breaches the core of the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement. The commentary warned that her remarks reflect Japan's right-wing forces' ambition to break the pacifist constitution, pursue military power, and abandon the 'three non-nuclear principles.' It condemned her actions as part of a pattern of revising history, including visits to Yasukuni Shrine, denial of the Nanjing Massacre, and amplifying the 'China threat' narrative. The article warned that Japan's invocation of 'survival crisis' echoes its past imperial justifications for aggression, such as the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, and warned against repeating history. It reaffirmed that national reunification is an unstoppable historical trend, and that any attempt to interfere in Taiwan will be met with resolute resistance. The People's Daily concluded with a warning: any military intervention by Japan would constitute aggression, and China will respond forcefully; Japan must immediately retract its remarks and cease dangerous military moves, or bear full responsibility for the consequences.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 02:04 AM\nSource:[QQ\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5fc3](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20251114A00VLQ00)\n\n**China Warns Japan: Military Intervention in Taiwan Would Trigger Strong Reaction**\nChina has issued a strong warning to Japan, stating that any military intervention by Japan in the Taiwan Strait on behalf of Taipei would be considered an act of invasion and would provoke a strong response from Beijing. The Chinese Foreign Ministry escalated tensions, marking the most intense rhetoric toward Tokyo in recent memory. The focus of the backlash is on Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who, following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea in late October, made remarks in a parliamentary hearing suggesting that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan could constitute a 'threat to Japan's survival,' thereby activating Japan's right to collective self-defense. Beijing responded with increasing severity, including calls from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian for Takaichi to 'correct her mistake immediately' and retract her statement, warning that Tokyo would 'bear all consequences' if she did not. Chinese state media and commentators, including sexist rhetoric, intensified their attacks, while the Chinese Consul General in Osaka, Xue Jian, posted on X (formerly Twitter) threatening to 'cut off the dirty head without hesitation'\u2014a post later removed. The incident sparked outrage in Japan, where calls grew for the expulsion of Xue, especially given the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Lin justified the consul's remarks as a response to Takaichi's 'unjust and dangerous' comments and urged Japan to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, warning, 'Those who play with fire will get burned.' Takaichi denied retracting her statements, explaining she was discussing a worst-case scenario without contradicting past government positions. China views Taiwan as a core red line in international relations, asserting sovereignty and threatening reunification by force if necessary. Japan, which administered Taiwan for 50 years until the end of World War II, remains a key obstacle to China's unification plans due to its deep historical and current bilateral ties with Taiwan. Before becoming prime minister, Takaichi visited Taipei with a parliamentary delegation and described Japan-Taiwan relations as 'almost an alliance,' a statement Beijing called 'unacceptable.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 08:04 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/mondo/2025/11/13/pechino-avvisa-tokyo-se-intervenite-su-taiwan-reagiremo_ea6c7069-71ce-4a0f-9b7e-f065a35a297a.html)\n\n**Tensions Rise in Asia: China's Firm Response to Japan's Taiwan Remarks**\nChina has issued a firm response to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takai\u00e7i's remarks suggesting Japan might use military force in the event of a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian stated that any such intervention by Japan would be considered an 'aggressive act' and that China would respond with force. Lin emphasized China's commitment to exercising its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law, reaffirming the protection of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. He urged Japan to immediately retract its statements, warning it would have to bear the consequences if it did not. Lin also questioned whether Takai\u00e7i\u2019s invocation of a 'national existence crisis' scenario signaled a return to Japan\u2019s past military aggression, accusing Japan of attempting to undermine the post-war international order. Takai\u00e7i had previously described a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait as a threat to Japan\u2019s existence under Japan\u2019s 2015 National Security Law, which permits the use of armed forces in response to attacks on allies that threaten Japan\u2019s survival. While Japan\u2019s leadership has previously protested China\u2019s objections, Takai\u00e7i maintained that his remarks were hypothetical and that he would avoid such statements in the future, but refused to retract them. The article also provides historical context: Taiwan was under Japanese control from 1895 to 1945 following the First Sino-Japanese War, after which it was handed over to the Allied Powers. Following the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party established the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, while the defeated Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, claiming to continue the Republic of China. Since 1949, Taiwan has functioned as a de facto independent entity. China continues to assert the 'One China' principle, opposes Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic recognition by other nations, and demands that countries sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. In recent years, China has increased military pressure on Taiwan, explicitly stating it would not rule out the use of force to achieve reunification.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:58 PM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/asyada-gerilim-artiyor-cinden-japonyaya-sert-yanit-979866h.htm)\n\n**China Condemns K\u014dchi's 'National Survival Crisis' Statement on Taiwan, Warns of Direct Retaliation**\nChina's Foreign Ministry's Deputy Spokesperson Lin Jian strongly rebuked Japanese Prime Minister Sanae K\u014dchi's statement in a parliamentary session on November 13, 2025, where she asserted that a conflict over Taiwan could constitute a 'national survival crisis situation' for Japan. Lin demanded immediate correction and withdrawal of the statement, warning that any Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan Strait would be considered an act of aggression and that China would 'inflict a decisive blow' in response. This marks the first time China has publicly called for a retraction of a parliamentary statement. K\u014dchi reiterated that her remarks did not alter the government's longstanding position and refused to retract them. Lin expressed dissatisfaction, stating Japan must reflect on its 'erroneous statement' and emphasized China's firm resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. He warned that 'playing with fire will burn the one who starts it.' The controversy intensified after X (formerly Twitter) posts by China's Consul General in Osaka, Xue Jian, threatening to 'cut off the dirty neck' of K\u014dchi, and Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi's call for China to respond appropriately during a visit to Canada. China's military newspaper, PLA Daily, criticized K\u014dchi's planned revision of three security-related documents, labeling Japan's shift toward a 'war-capable state' as a dangerous move. The Communist Youth League's China Youth Daily called her remarks a 'dangerous provocation to regional peace,' while the English edition of the People's Daily-affiliated Global Times accused K\u014dchi's administration of challenging China's 'red line' on Taiwan just one month after taking office, severely undermining recent efforts to ease tensions between the two nations.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[nikkansports.com](https://www.nikkansports.com/general/news/202511130001420.html)\n\n**China Warns Japan: Military Intervention in Taiwan Strait Would Trigger Forceful Response**\nOn November 13, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian condemned Japanese Prime Minister Asahi Hayato's remarks during a parliamentary session on November 7, in which she stated that a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait could constitute a 'national survival crisis' for Japan. Lin Jian emphasized that such statements violate the one-China principle, breach the spirit of the four joint political documents between China and Japan, and contravene basic norms of international relations. He warned that if Japan resorts to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait, China will 'strike back forcefully' and exercise its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Lin Jian underscored that Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and resolving the Taiwan issue is an internal matter for China, not subject to external interference. He questioned Japan's motives, drawing historical parallels to Japan's militarist past, including the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, and warned that repeating such rhetoric risks undermining post-war international order and damaging Sino-Japanese relations. Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao also denounced the claim on X, stating that promoting 'Taiwan's crisis is Japan's crisis' seeks to drag Japan into a path of splitting China, which would lead to an irreversible and dangerous course. The Japanese 'survival crisis' doctrine, as defined by the 2015 revised security laws, allows Japan to exercise collective self-defense and take military action without prior U.S. approval if a foreign country under close ties is attacked and the threat is deemed to endanger Japan's survival, effectively including Taiwan in that category.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 09:14 AM\nSource:[guancha.cn](https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2025_11_13_796879.shtml)\n\n**China Condemns Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi's Remarks on Taiwan, Warns of Self-Defense Response to Military Intervention**\nChina's Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi for her remarks in the Diet on November 10, 2024, in which she stated that 'Taiwan's crisis could constitute a national survival crisis for Japan,' allowing Japan to exercise collective self-defense.

He questioned whether Takaichi\u2019s current rhetoric signals a revival of Japanese militarism and a challenge to the post-World War II international order. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also reaffirmed that Taiwan is a sovereign state, with its sovereignty belonging to all Taiwanese people, and that the People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan\u2014this is a widely recognized international fact.

China asserts that the resolution, which resulted in Taiwan's expulsion from the UN and the transfer of its seat to the People's Republic of China (PRC), provides international legal backing for its claim over Taiwan. Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China (ROC), argues that the resolution does not mention Taiwan and that the PRC has never governed the island, calling China's interpretation 'deliberately deceptive.' The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan stated that China's narrative aims to create a legal foundation for altering the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and enabling a future military attack. It emphasized that only Taiwan's democratically elected government can represent its 23 million people in the UN and multilateral international forums. China has not renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control and regularly conducts military activities near the island. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement replete with Cold War-era rhetoric, claimed the PRC is the legitimate successor to the government of all China, including Taiwan, following the 1949 revolution. It warned that challenging Resolution 2758 constitutes a challenge to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the authority of the UN.

The incident follows China\u2019s approval of plans to turn the shoal, which Taiwan also claims, into a national nature reserve, a move that could test Manila\u2019s response over the 150\u202fkm\u00b2 triangular chain of reefs. The dispute is part of a broader contest over sovereignty and fishing access in the South China Sea, where China claims almost the entire sea, overlapping the exclusive economic zones of Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. No armed conflict has yet resulted from these tensions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 16, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[Taipei Times](https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2025/09/17/2003843924)\n\n**Cao Xingcheng: The CCP Will Follow East Germany\u2019s Collapse**\nThe Epoch Times article reports that UMC founder Cao Xingcheng, after the release of the war drama \"Zero Day Attack\" (\u96f6\u65e5\u653b\u64ca), publicly criticized the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for its aggressive stance toward Taiwan. Cao said the CCP\u2019s 2018 constitutional amendment that declares \"Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People\u2019s Republic of China\" is \"a blatant forgery\" and that the party\u2019s threat of \"\u6b66\u529b\u7d71\u4e00\" (military unification) is \"invasion, murder, arson, and robbery\"\u2014an act he labels \"anti\u2011human, anti\u2011civilization\". He argues that the CCP will inevitably collapse like East Germany, citing the East German fall in 1989\u20131990 as a parallel.\n\nCao also highlighted his own investment of 20\u202fmillion NTD (\u2248$672,300) in the film, noting that the production team plans to publish a scriptbook and novel by the end of September. He quoted the meeting with producer Lin Jinchang on 24\u202fMay\u202f2023, when the idea to film the story was first proposed.\n\nThe article invokes John Locke\u2019s 1689 \"Second Treatise of Government\" to argue that governments must protect life, property, and liberty, and that the CCP\u2019s actions violate these rights. Cao claims the United States will not tolerate a CCP invasion of Taiwan, citing the 1950 MacArthur statement that Taiwan is a \"strategic air\u2011carrier\" for the U.S. and the U.S. State Department\u2019s reaffirmation that UN Resolution\u202f2758 does not confer sovereignty over Taiwan to the CCP.\n\nHe accuses CCP officials of corruption, claiming that their wealth is hidden abroad and would be frozen if Taiwan were attacked. Cao concludes that the CCP\u2019s military threat is merely a bluff and that the real danger lies in covert infiltration and \"Trojan\u2011city slaughter\" within Taiwan\u2019s political system, a theme explored in \"Zero Day Attack\".\n\nKey metrics and dates: 20\u202fmillion NTD investment (\u2248$672,300), meeting on 24\u202fMay\u202f2023, article published 9\u202fSeptember\u202f2025.\n\nQuotes (single\u2011quoted):\n- \"\u6b66\u529b\u7d71\u4e00\"\u5c31\u662f\u4fb5\u7565\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u6bba\u4eba\u653e\u706b\u3001\u6253\u5bb6\u52ab\u820d\u3002\n- \"\u4e2d\u5171\u4e00\u5b9a\u6703\u6b65\u6771\u5fb7\u57ae\u53f0\u7684\u5f8c\u5875\uff0c\u88ab\u6383\u9032\u6b77\u53f2\u7684\u5783\u573e\u5806\u3002\"\n- \"\u7f8e\u570b\u4eba\u4e0d\u6703\u5141\u8a31\u4e2d\u5171\u6b66\u529b\u72af\u53f0\uff0c\u4e0d\u50c5\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u662f\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u56e0\u70ba\u6b64\u8209\u6703\u4fb5\u72af\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5229\u76ca\u3002\"\n\nThe piece is a strongly opinionated political critique, presenting the CCP\u2019s actions as criminal and inevitable, and urging vigilance among Taiwanese readers.\n\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 02:46 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/9/9/n14590609.htm)\n\n**Taiwan, China battle it out in competing World War Two narratives**\nThe article reports that as China prepares a mass military parade in Beijing to mark the end of World War\u202fII, Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are engaged in a heated dispute over who should be credited with the victory.  Taiwan\u2019s top China\u2011policy maker, Chiu\u202fChui\u2011cheng, said on the August\u202f15 anniversary that the Republic of China (ROC) led the war of resistance against Japan, while the PRC\u2019s Communist Party has repeatedly claimed it was the party that led the fight.  Chiu noted that the ROC signed the peace agreement with Japan after the war, whereas the PRC did not exist at that time.  The Mainland Affairs Council, headed by Chiu, said the communists\u2019 strategy during the war was \u201c70\u202f% about strengthening themselves, 20\u202f% dealing with the republican government and 10\u202f% about opposing Japan,\u201d a claim the party has denied.  Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry staged a concert featuring images of World War\u202fII\u2011era republican soldiers and the Flying Tigers, and the programme stated, \u2018History affirms that the War of Resistance was led and won by the Republic of China.\u2019  In response, the PRC\u2019s official newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, warned against \u201cdistort[ing] and falsify[ing] the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s role as the country\u2019s backbone\u201d in fighting Japan.  The PRC claims the victory belongs to all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, and celebrates that the war\u2019s end in 1945 led to Taiwan\u2019s return to Chinese rule.  Taiwan\u2019s President Lai\u202fChing\u2011te posted on Facebook that aggression will be defeated, alluding to Beijing\u2019s military threats.  The PRC says it is the successor state to the ROC and that Taiwan is an inherent part of Beijing\u2019s territory, a view Taipei strongly rejects.  Taiwan\u2019s government urged its citizens not to attend the Chinese parade, warning it would reinforce Beijing\u2019s territorial claims.  Veteran Pan, who fled to Taiwan after the civil war, said, \u2018I can\u2019t say anything good about the communists,\u2019 and viewed the parade as unrelated to him.  The piece is a Reuters report dated August\u202f24\u202f2025, with no apparent bias and a low level of provocative language.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 24, 2025 02:15 AM\nSource:[ThePrint](https://theprint.in/world/taiwan-china-battle-it-out-in-competing-world-war-two-narratives/2727684/)\n\n**Trump Claims Xi Jinping Assured Him China Won't Invade Taiwan**\nUS President Donald Trump claims that Chinese President Xi Jinping assured him that China will not invade Taiwan as long as Trump is in office. Trump made this statement in an interview with Fox News, which was published by Newsweek. According to Trump, Xi said, 'I will never do it while you are president.' Trump replied, 'Well, I appreciate that, but he also added, 'But I am very patient, and China is very patient.' Trump did not specify when Xi made this promise. The first confirmed phone call between the two leaders during Trump's second term took place in June. Newsweek reached out to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment, but received no response. The magazine notes that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could lead to a military response from the US, resulting in a direct conflict between two nuclear superpowers and potentially catastrophic consequences for the world. China has repeatedly stated that the 'Taiwan question' is a top priority in Sino-US relations and insists on the 'one China' principle. Taiwan, with a population of around 23 million, is a partially recognized democratic state that China considers a 'rebellious province' and part of its territory. The island's government rejects the 'one country, two systems' model promoted by China since the 1980s. In recent years, China has conducted large-scale military exercises off the coast of Taiwan, which some military analysts have seen as a rehearsal for an invasion. The passage of military ships from other countries through the strait separating Taiwan from mainland China is seen by Beijing as a provocation. Xi has repeatedly stated that Taiwan will be 'reunified' with mainland China and has set a deadline of 2027 for establishing Chinese sovereignty over the island. Trump's second term is set to end in early 2029.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/tramp-si-czinpin-poobesal-licno-cto-kitaj-ne-vtorgnetsa-na-tajvan/a-73669642)\n\n**China and Taiwan: Understanding the Ongoing Conflict**\nThe article explains the ongoing conflict between China and Taiwan, tracing its roots to the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, when the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan after losing to the Communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Since then, two entities have existed: the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, which continued to claim legitimacy as China's rightful government. Over time, international recognition shifted to the PRC, culminating in Taiwan losing its UN seat in 1972 and the U.S. recognizing Beijing in 1979 while pledging to support Taiwan militarily. Taiwan evolved into a democratic, economically advanced society, becoming a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing through companies like TSMC. It is now regarded as one of the most liberal and democratic nations in Asia, having legalized same-sex marriage in 2019. Despite China's official stance that Taiwan is an 'independent province' and its repeated threats of 'reunification' by force, most Taiwanese identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, especially after observing the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong. Analysts warn that a military invasion could occur as early as 2027 or 2049, though China may instead pursue non-military strategies like economic blockades or cyberattacks. The article notes that while China claims peaceful reunification, current developments suggest growing tension and a diminishing likelihood of peaceful resolution.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 23, 2024 10:54 AM\nSource:[sauerlandkurier.de](https://www.sauerlandkurier.de/politik/china-taiwan-konflikt-fotostrecke-zr-91693880.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014encompassing military analysis, crisis risk assessment, diplomacy, international relations theories, strategic studies, and regional expertise\u2014there is broad consensus that the probability of a direct armed conflict between Taiwan (ROC) and China (PRC) resulting in at least 100 deaths before January 1, 2026, is very low. Common themes informing this judgment include: (1) the extremely low base rate of large-scale, lethal incidents in cross-Strait relations\u2014no such event has occurred since 1949, with all recent crises contained well below this threshold; (2) strong deterrence provided by U.S. and Japanese security commitments, which raise the stakes for escalation; (3) mutual political and domestic incentives to avoid high-casualty conflict, with polling in Taiwan reflecting public aversion to war; (4) current escalatory rhetoric and increased PLA activity, rising risks of accidental incidents, but no evidence of operational preparations or mobilization for imminent attack; (5) extensive conflict management mechanisms, crisis communication channels, and established protocols helping to prevent unintentional escalation; and (6) the very short time frame remaining (about six weeks), making sudden and massive escalation historically unprecedented and logistically unlikely. While all experts grant a nonzero risk\u2014potentially from accident, miscalculation, or a black swan event\u2014the overwhelming weight is on a 'No' outcome, with final probabilities ranging from 2% to 8%, and most clustered at 2-4%. The most plausible pathway to a 'Yes' resolution would be a rapid, uncontrolled escalation from a misjudged encounter, but all available indicators point to continued deterrence, signaling, and avoidance of direct war through the resolution period.",
