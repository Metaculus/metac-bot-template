Political and economic pressures are real but cannot supersede animal health protocols, especially given the catastrophic risk of NWS establishment in the US. Unless there is a dramatic, public, and verified declaration of 'NWS eradicated from northern Mexico' and a corresponding USDA policy shift in the coming weeks, the default is for the border to remain closed through the end of the year.

However, progress is real and the window is not closed\u2014if there are no further outbreaks and political pressure intensifies, a late-December partial reopening is possible, but not the base case. Historical base rates for reopening after animal disease outbreaks in NAFTA/USMCA contexts, especially where US livestock biosecurity is threatened, typically run longer than 2 months post-last-detection. Status quo bias and regulatory inertia further reinforce a conservative estimate.",

Your argument emphasizes the 'meaningfully elevated' chance of reopening due to technical and political signals, but it underestimates the impact of recent historical precedent: the July 2025 reopening was immediately reversed on a single new case, and there has been no explicit change in USDA policy since then.

You also highlight the bureaucratic realities of holiday-season slowdowns and the institutional pattern of extreme caution in the wake of previous snap closures.

Your low probability estimate (10%) is justified by the recent pattern of policy reversals and the lack of a formal or even suggested timeline from US authorities.

This on-the-ground perspective is crucial: even if high-level signals become more favorable, the practical mechanics of coordinating a safe, verifiable reopening within six weeks are daunting.

The USDA's repeated, explicit caution and public rhetoric about uncompromised safety indicate that even mounting economic and political pressure is unlikely to override risk aversion in the short remaining window.

The base rate for border reopening within 2-3 months of a border-proximate detection is extremely low, and the USDA's language remains strictly noncommittal. Political pressure is real, but as you note, the administration is more likely to err on the side of caution with biosecurity in an election cycle\u2014meaning a 'surprise' December reopening, while not impossible, should be treated as highly improbable.

NWS flies are parasitic insects that lay eggs in wounds or bodily orifices of warm-blooded animals; upon hatching, the larvae burrow into the tissue and feed on living flesh, causing severe tissue damage and often leading to the death of the host animal. A single female NWS fly can lay up to 3,000 eggs in her lifetime, making infestations highly destructive to livestock. The facility will release sterile male flies to disrupt reproduction and reduce the population of harmful NWS flies, thereby protecting U.S. agricultural interests. The announcement was made in a USDA statement released on November 14, 2025, by The Epoch Times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 05:19 PM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/usda-opens-mexican-facility-for-controlling-spread-of-flesh-eating-new-world-screwworm-5944755)\n\n**USDA confirms new sterile fly facility in Northern Mexico**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on November 13, 2025, the opening of a sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico, as part of its efforts to prevent the spread of New World screwworm (NWS) into the United States. The Tampico facility enables aerial dispersal of sterile flies across northeastern Mexico, including Nuevo Le\u00f3n, enhancing the USDA\u2019s ability to respond quickly to outbreaks. US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins stated the facility is a critical tool in the fight against screwworm, emphasizing its role in pushing the pest southward. The USDA is implementing a five-pronged strategy with Mexico, including aerial dispersal and ground release chambers. Aerial operations are preferred for large-scale, hard-to-reach areas, while ground chambers allow rapid deployment outside facility range. The USDA currently releases 100 million sterile flies per week in Mexico, but aerial dispersal had previously been limited to southern Mexico. Although new NWS cases have been confirmed in southern Mexico, there has been no significant northward spread; the two most northern detections were in Nuevo Le\u00f3n on September 20 and October 5, 2025, in cattle from Chiapas, both inactive with no further detections. The USDA is transitioning from ground release chambers to aerial dispersal in Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Sterile flies are produced at the COPEG facility in Panama, and the USDA is investing $21 million to help Mexico renovate a fruit fly facility in Metapa, which will double NWS production capacity once completed\u2014expected to begin operations by summer 2026. Additionally, the USDA plans a $750 million investment to build the first domestic sterile NWS fly production facility at Moore Air Base in Edinburg, Texas, projected to be operational by early 2026.

This effort is part of broader efforts to protect cattle health, as highlighted by multiple recent reports. The University of Missouri Extension reported that anaplasmosis has spread to 48 counties in Missouri, with ongoing research into diagnosis, prevention, and management strategies. Auburn University is targeting horn flies, while Kansas State University and other institutions are addressing new tick species in Kansas, parasite control, and bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Rutgers University is investigating an invasive tick threat, and the FDA has approved gamithromycin for BRD treatment. Additionally, Seek Labs' BioSeeker now detects foot-and-mouth disease, and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has approved a new vaccine targeting respiratory and reproductive pathogens. The Montana Department of Agriculture confirmed a brucellosis case in a cowherd, and research continues on disease transmission via mosquito preferences and anemia symptoms in adult cows.

The mission aimed to strengthen export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses, supporting rural prosperity and global competitiveness. Mexico remains a key trade partner, especially for U.S. cattle imports and beef exports. TCFA representatives\u2014Past Chairman Robby Kirkland, Board Member Alvaro Bustillos, and President & CEO Ben Weinheimer\u2014attended meetings, events, and site visits. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized that U.S. exports to Mexico have grown by 57% since the USMCA took effect in 2020, totaling over $120 billion in additional trade. She highlighted ongoing cooperation with Mexico to combat the New World Screwworm (NWS), stating that the U.S. has been more aggressive than any previous administration in addressing the issue. Rollins also noted progress toward reopening U.S. ports, though no timeline was announced, and affirmed the need for thorough verification and coordination with top officials, including President Trump. Kirkland reported that meetings with Mexico\u2019s Secretary of Agriculture Dr. Julio A.

Nearby live cattle closed at $221.35 per hundredweight, a 6.4% drop, while feeder cattle finished at $326.40, down 3.7%. The selloff occurred without the CFTC Commitments of Traders report, adding to market ambiguity. Although fundamentals have not shifted dramatically since July\u2014when feeder cattle rose $50 and live cattle $25 per hundredweight\u2014this rally may have been overdone. Potential factors include Argentine beef import volumes, possible tariff relaxation on Brazilian beef, and the prospect of reopening the U.S.-Mexico border to Mexican cattle. President Trump\u2019s rhetoric on high beef prices may also be influencing market psychology. However, the primary driver appears to be managed money avoiding uncertainty, with a likely 'RESET' in positioning. Cash markets remained relatively stable: $230 per hundredweight in the North and $232 in the South, though $3\u2013$4 lower than the previous week. December live cattle ended at $221, down from a peak of $248 in mid-October, while cash prices only reached $240\u2013$241. Technical analysis shows large downside gaps on daily charts, with no breach of the prior week\u2019s gap, indicating a weak market structure. Few traders are willing to go long until clarity returns. The author concludes that while money flow and technicals can override fundamentals in the short term, fundamentals will prevail long-term.

Government interventions in 2025\u2014specifically the closure of the Mexican border and imposition of high tariffs on imported beef\u2014intensified the market's upward pressure. Despite ongoing factors such as consumer willingness to pay higher prices and persistent drought, recent government actions suggest a potential reversal of prior interventions, which may lead to a return of feeder cattle prices to around $241.00, as indicated by the CME feeder cattle index. The decline is expected to be gradual, possibly taking until November 2026 to fully materialize. The author projects downside retracement levels and evaluates which futures contract months are most likely to reach these targets. Volatility is anticipated due to unresolved uncertainties and unpredictable actions by the Trump administration. Input costs remain elevated: diesel fuel prices surged above June highs within three weeks, corn prices rose unexpectedly despite abundant supply, soybeans continue climbing, and wheat shows early upward momentum, with a recommendation to consider buying July Chicago or Kansas City wheat. Interest rates remain high and stagnant, with government stimulus efforts\u2014such as increased payroll and potential cash payouts\u2014likely to hinder rate cuts and possibly fuel short-term inflation. The article notes a rise in credit card delinquencies, higher than any previous year, particularly exacerbated by holiday spending in early 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 04:22 PM\nSource:[Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36128580/shootin-the-bull-about-strangleholds)\n\n**USDA confirms new sterile fly facility in Northern Mexico**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on November 13, 2025, the opening of a sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico, as part of its efforts to prevent the spread of New World screwworm (NWS) into the United States.

He cited record-high beef prices nationwide expected to persist into 2026 and the lowest U.S. cattle herd inventory since 1951. In response, Julie Anna Potts, president and CEO of the Meat Institute, stated that beef packers have been operating at a loss due to record-high cattle prices and tight supply, despite elevated consumer prices. She emphasized that the beef industry is heavily regulated, transactions are transparent, and USDA data confirms ongoing losses projected through 2026. The Meat Institute welcomed a fact-based discussion on beef affordability. R-CALF USA, represented by CEO Bill Bullard, supported the DOJ investigation, arguing there is a longstanding disconnect between cattle and beef prices, which indicates market failure, and called for a competitive market to ensure fair prices for producers and consumers. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association (NCBA) cautioned in October that market manipulation efforts risk harming American cattlemen without significantly lowering consumer prices.

Although President Donald Trump is focused on reopening the border\u2014closed since May\u2014Rollins emphasized that the U.S. must ensure complete confidence in containment efforts before lifting restrictions. She praised Mexico\u2019s improved cooperation, calling it 'the most collaborative effort, perhaps in our lifetime, between the two different departments of agriculture,' and noted that 11 screwworm cases in Mexican border states have been contained. Rollins highlighted that the parasite, which lays eggs in wounds and whose larvae consume living tissue, has not yet crossed into the U.S., but poses a significant threat, with potential damages to Texas' economy estimated at $1.8 billion. She acknowledged that illegal cattle trafficking, involving forged documents and stolen livestock from Central America, remains a major concern, though Mexico has strengthened checkpoints and protections. Despite about 250,000 cattle waiting to enter the U.S. and rising beef prices, Rollins insisted that safety is paramount, stating, 'We can never compromise the safety of the herd for the cost,' and that premature reopening could lead to far greater long-term economic damage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/s/viewarticle/exclusive-us-not-ready-lift-mexican-cattle-ban-over-2025a1000ubl)\n\n**Mexico boosts controls on cattle after new screwworm case found near US border in Nuevo Leon**\nMexico activated emergency controls on Monday after a new case of the New World screwworm was detected in cattle in the town of Sabinas Hidalgo, Nuevo\u202fLeon, the closest case to the U.S. border since the outbreak began last year.

The infected animal, found in Sabinas\u202fIldefonso, came from Veracruz, where the last case was reported on July\u202f9 and had prompted Washington to suspend imports of live Mexican cattle. The parasite, a larva of the *Cochliomyia hominivorax* fly, attacks warm\u2011blooded animals, including humans, and Mexico has reported more than 500 active cases in cattle across southern states. The import ban has hurt the Mexican government, which is already dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats. Ranchers and the government seek to lift the ban; if it remains in place for the year, the ranching federation estimates losses of up to $400\u202fmillion.

Despite the end of peak grilling season, ground beef prices remain historically elevated due to tight cattle supplies and strong demand. Danyelle Chinn, research analyst at the University of Missouri Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center (RaFF), noted that while high prices signal positive conditions for cattle producers, consumers are bearing the financial impact. The root causes include multiple years of drought, which reduced forage and hay availability, forcing producers to cull herds and reduce heifer retention. As a result, current beef cow numbers are the lowest since 1961. Additionally, the USDA closed the border to cattle imports from Mexico due to the northward spread of New World screwworms, further reducing supply. Feedlots in the southern U.S. rely on Mexican cattle, so the import ban has tightened the domestic supply. High input costs have also limited herd expansion. Despite rising prices, demand remains strong\u2014driven by summer grilling and high-protein consumer trends\u2014creating a 'perfect storm' of limited supply and robust demand. Tucker from MU Extension stated that rebuilding the herd will take years, meaning short-term prices may rise further. A potential drop in prices could only occur with increased supply or reduced demand, such as from an economic downturn causing consumers to switch to cheaper proteins. For now, consumers face continued high costs at the meat counter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[feedlotmagazine.com](https://www.feedlotmagazine.com/news/marketing/beef-prices-remain-high/article_b160c8ce-32c5-4a5a-8daa-ece85517ab74.html)\n\n**Santa Teresa Cattle Crossing to Remain Closed Due to New World Screw-worm Parasite Detection**\nThe Santa Teresa cattle crossing, the largest in the US-Mexico border, will not reopen on July 21 as planned due to the detection of an additional case of the New World Screw-worm parasite in Mexico. The crossing has been closed since May 11 after the US Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, announced the immediate suspension of live cattle, horse, and bison imports from the US following the detection of the parasite in southern Mexico. The USDA had published a plan in July to reopen the crossing in stages, but new cases were detected in northern Mexico, forcing the closure of all crossings. The Secretary of Agriculture for the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, Jeff Witte, stated that the impact of the continued closure on New Mexico's agriculture is small but has significant implications for the national beef industry. 'The majority of cattle that enter through Santa Teresa end up in feedlots or pastures in other states, destined for places like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska,' Witte said. 'At some point, there were trucks from 17 different states picking up cattle.' The movement of the parasite, previously eradicated from the US for decades, has disrupted international cattle trade through New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. The USDA has announced the construction of a $8.5 million facility to breed sterilized flies to prevent further reproduction in the wild, located in the Moore Air Base in Mission, Texas, and $21 million to produce more sterile flies in a facility in Metapa, Mexico. The USDA also stated that it will increase monitoring and data exchange with Mexican officials along the border. However, Mexican agricultural agents detected a new case in Veracruz, 370 miles from the border, on July 7, forcing the USDA to cancel the reopening plan. 'The US has promised to be vigilant -- and after detecting this new case of NWS, we are pausing the planned reopening of the port to quarantine more and attack this deadly plague in Mexico,' Rollins said in a written statement on July 9. 'We must see additional progress in combating NWS in Veracruz and other nearby Mexican states to reopen cattle ports along the southern border.' Daniel Manzanares, the director of the Santa Teresa international crossing, stated that the USDA has not said when the reopening will occur. The crossing is privately owned by the Cooperativa Uni\u00f3n Ganadera Regional de Chihuahua, which often moves cattle from northern Mexico to feedlots in the US. The plague has not been detected in the northern part of Mexico, but cattle still cannot cross. In previous years, approximately 270,000 animals would have crossed the border by now, said Manzanares. This year, with the closures, only a third, or 74,000, have made it across, requiring the layoffs of half of the workers hired to transport cattle. 'It has severely impacted all types of industry here below, from truckers to buyers, cattle runners, we've laid off employees who won't return,' said Manzanares. 'It's simply breaking a lot of people'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 21, 2025 11:57 AM\nSource:[El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez](https://diario.mx/el-paso/2025/jul/20/reapertura-al-cruce-de-ganado-por-santa-teresa-tendra-que-esperar-1076355.html)\n\n**US-Mexico Border Reopens for Cattle Imports after New World Screwworm Scare**\nThe US-Mexico border has reopened for cattle imports after a new world screwworm scare. US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that 'key progress' had been made in controlling the pest, with over 100 million sterile flies being dispersed weekly and no northward spread in eight weeks. The US had restricted Mexican cattle shipments in November after the detection of the pest, but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place. However, after an 'unacceptable northward advancement' of the screwworm, the ban was reinstated in May. Mexico Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said that the border opening would begin on July 7. The US plans to create 'fly factories' to produce sterile flies to fight the pest, with a new facility expected to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. The USDA expects to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 19, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[legalinsurrection.com](https://legalinsurrection.com/2025/07/us-mexico-border-reopens-for-cattle-imports-after-new-world-screwworm-scare/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that while there has been technical progress (notably the opening of the Tampico sterile fly facility and reported containment of new screwworm outbreaks), the probability that the U.S. will reopen cattle imports from Mexico before 2026 remains low. Most experts highlighted the recent history of cautious and risk-averse U.S. regulatory responses, noting that previous reopening attempts (e.g., in July 2025) were quickly reversed after new detections. Despite high economic and industry pressure from record beef prices and significant losses to the Mexican cattle sector, the USDA and the Trump administration have maintained a public stance prioritizing biosecurity and risk elimination over short-term economic relief. Several experts stressed that the short time frame (about 6 weeks until January 1, 2026) is insufficient for U.S. regulators to be fully confident in sustained containment, particularly as the USDA historically requires several months with no new northern cases before reopening borders. Political pressures are acknowledged as real but generally not decisive against the backdrop of animal health risk and bureaucratic timeline constraints. All cited the historical base rates for rapid reversal of disease-related import bans as low, and recent optimistic statements from USDA officials were interpreted as indicative of incremental, not imminent, change. Probability estimates for reopening before 2026 cluster between 10% and 30%, with the majority in the 15\u201328% range, reflecting technical progress but strong institutional and historical biases toward delay. The most likely scenario remains that the U.S. border stays closed through the end of 2025, with only a modest chance of a narrowly tailored, late-December reopening if no further cases are found and political pressure peaks.",
