Furthermore, the recognition that legislative attention is currently focused on automating male registration or even abolishing Selective Service, rather than expanding it to women, demonstrates strong awareness of both the policy agenda and the legislative process.

The analysis is consistent with observed legislative behavior and the base rates for such reforms, reinforcing the conclusion that the probability of change before 2026 remains very low barring an external shock. This legislative process-centric perspective aligns closely with the rational choice view of path dependence and institutional inertia."

Specifically, the forecast could more explicitly address the continued judicial deference to Congress in this arena, as established in Rostker v. Goldberg and reaffirmed by the Supreme Court's refusal to revisit the issue in 2021. Moreover, the forecast could more fully explore how the Trump administration's regulatory and definitional actions (such as the strict binary sex designation in federal law and documents) further diminish the likelihood of rapid policy change in this sphere. By integrating these doctrinal and statutory factors, the forecast would provide a more comprehensive and legally grounded rationale for its low probability assessment, making the argument even more compelling."

The forecast\u2019s recognition that technical readiness is missing\u2014due to Selective Service board vacancies and regulatory stasis\u2014adds a practical layer that aligns with legal doctrines on justiciability and ripeness.

From a Liberal Feminist perspective, this is crucial: formal legal equality cannot be achieved without practical administrative capacity. This analysis complements feminist concerns about de facto versus de jure equality and the importance of institutional readiness in turning legislative ideals into lived realities. It also appropriately weights the base rate: there is no precedent for expanding Selective Service to women, and even robust recommendations have not translated into action. The forecast\u2019s recognition of a very slim 'tail risk' from a crisis is prudent but correctly relegated to the margins.

Additionally, by focusing narrowly on the legal and procedural timeline, the analysis risks overlooking how intersectional backlash\u2014against both gender expansion and militarism\u2014contributes to the legislative inertia that doctrine alone cannot fully explain. Integrating intersectional sociopolitical analysis would provide a more holistic account of why the legal status quo is so resilient, beyond formal doctrine and statutory pace."

In the [opinion denying certification](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-928_e1p3.pdf) (written by Justice Sotomayor and joined by Justices Breyer and Kavanaugh) the following is stated (edited for easier readability):\n\n>In 2016, Congress created the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service (NCMNPS) and tasked it with studying whether Selective Service registration should be conducted \u201cregardless of sex.\u201d\n\n>. . .\n\n>On March 25, 2020, the Commission released its final report, in which it recommended \u201celiminat[ing] male-only registration.\u201d Among other things, the Commission found that \u201c[m]ale-only registration sends a message to women not only that they are not vital to the defense of the country but also that they are not expected to participate in defending it.\u201d Just a few months ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the report, where Chairman Jack Reed expressed his \u201chope\u201d that a gender-neutral registration requirement will be \u201cincorporated into the next national defense bill.\u201d \n\n>. . .\n\n>It remains to be seen, of course, whether Congress will end gender-based registration under the Military Selective Service Act. But at least for now, the Court\u2019s longstanding deference to Congress on matters of national defense and military affairs cautions against granting review while Congress actively weighs the issue. I agree with the Court\u2019s decision to deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\nA provision requiring women to register appeared in both the [2021](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/06/ndaa-women-draft-dropped-523829) and [2022](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/2022-12-07/us-congress-covid-vaccine-8332200.html) versions of the Senate Armed Services Committee's proposed [National Defense Authorization Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act), but was ultimately removed each year.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":19914,\"question_id\":19914}}`",

The rule, previously blocked by a federal court in Boston, had been temporarily suspended due to concerns it violated constitutional rights to equal protection and was based on 'irrational bias' against transgender individuals. The Supreme Court's decision, issued without a written opinion\u2014typical for emergency rulings\u2014was made by a majority vote. Three liberal justices\u2014Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan\u2014issued separate dissenting opinions. Jackson warned the new policy 'allows harm to be inflicted on the most vulnerable citizens' and subjects them to 'humiliating scrutiny and heightened suspicion.' The prior policy, in place for over 30 years, allowed gender changes in passports with medical documentation. Under the Biden administration in 2021, the State Department simplified the process by removing the need for medical proof and introduced a third gender option 'X' for non-binary and intersex individuals. Following Donald Trump's return to the White House in January 2025, his administration began reversing LGBTQ+ protections, including previously supporting a ban on transgender military service and approving cuts to government funding for gender and sexual identity research.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 01:02 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/transludi-v-ssa-ne-smogut-ukazyvat-svou-identicnost-v-pasporte/a-74661256)\n\n**Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Ban Gender-Neutral Passport Designations**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday, November 6, 2025, in a 6-3 decision to allow the Trump administration to enforce a policy requiring U.S. passports to display only 'Male' or 'Female' gender markers, overturning a lower court ruling that had permitted applicants to choose an 'X' gender designation. The decision upheld the government's argument that marking a person's birth sex on a passport is akin to stating their country of birth\u2014both are factual records that do not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The majority opinion emphasized that both gender and birthplace are objective facts and do not constitute discrimination. The dissenting justices\u2014Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Sonia Sotomayor\u2014called the ruling a 'meaningless but painful distortion.' The Department of Justice's Deputy Attorney General D. John Sauer argued that lower courts' rulings blocking the policy were 'unsustainable' and infringed on the President\u2019s constitutional authority in foreign affairs. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), representing transgender, non-binary, and intersex U.S. citizens, warned the new policy poses 'potential dangers' for these individuals when traveling and claimed it violates federal law and constitutional equal protection rights. The policy had previously been blocked by a federal judge appointed under President Biden and the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 11:54 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/11/6/n14631064.htm)\n\n**Supreme Court hands Trump a win on passport biological sex rule**\nOn November 6, 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of the Trump administration on a passport policy requiring that biological sex\u2014rather than gender identity\u2014be listed on passports. The unsigned majority opinion stated that displaying biological sex at birth is not discriminatory, as it reflects a 'historical fact' similar to listing a person's country of birth, and does not violate equal protection principles. The ruling emphasized that the government\u2019s choice to display biological sex lacks no purpose other than to harm a politically unpopular group, and that the State Department was not acting arbitrarily in following Presidential directives mandated by Congress. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, arguing that the Court failed to consider the imminent, concrete harm to plaintiffs if the policy took effect immediately, while the government offered no evidence of harm if the policy were temporarily blocked. Jackson criticized the decision as part of a recurring pattern of the Court favoring the administration on the emergency docket without equitable justification. This ruling marks the latest victory for the Trump administration on emergency appeals, including cases related to the firing of the Register of Copyrights, the termination of temporary protected status for Venezuelans, and requests to allow the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, with a hearing scheduled for January 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 09:51 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3878384/supreme-court-hands-trump-a-win-on-passport-biological-sex-rule/)\n\n**Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to enforce its transgender passport ban**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on November 6, 2025, allowed the Trump administration to enforce a policy requiring passports to display an individual's 'biological sex at birth,' effectively barring transgender and nonbinary Americans from selecting their preferred gender marker. The unsigned opinion, decided along partisan lines, stated that displaying sex at birth does not violate equal protection principles, comparing it to recording a person's country of birth as a historical fact. This reverses a 2021 Biden administration policy that allowed applicants to self-identify as male, female, or 'X' based on gender identity. The Trump administration's executive order, issued in January 2025, redefined sex as strictly binary and anatomically determined, leading to reports of transgender individuals receiving passports inconsistent with their identity, including actress Hunter Schafer. A federal judge in Massachusetts had previously blocked the order, calling it 'rooted in irrational prejudice,' but the Supreme Court's interim ruling permits enforcement while the case remains under review. All three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warning the decision 'paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate justification.'

The majority opinion, authored by the Court, stated that the policy is likely to prevail on the merits, asserting that listing sex at birth 'no more offends equal protection principles than displaying country of birth' and that it reflects a 'historical fact' without discrimination. The Court also emphasized that the injunction interfered with an executive policy involving foreign affairs implications related to government documents. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, dissented, arguing that the policy inflicts immediate harm on transgender Americans and that the government failed to demonstrate an urgent need for the rule. Jackson warned the policy forces transgender individuals to use documents that could expose them to 'harassment and bodily invasions' during travel. The policy originates from Executive Order 14168, signed by President Donald Trump on January 20, which redefined sex in federal law as an immutable biological category based on reproductive anatomy at conception and directed all federal agencies to adopt this definition in identification documents and data systems. This action is part of a broader set of measures by the administration to roll back LGBTQ+ protections, including reinstating the ban on transgender military service, restricting gender-affirming care, and halting federal funding for programs referencing 'gender ideology.' The case will now return to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for further proceedings, with the stay remaining in place until the Supreme Court decides whether to hear the case on the merits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[bnonews.com](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2025/11/supreme-court-allows-trump-administration-to-enforce-passport-rule-listing-sex-at-birth/)\n\n**Supreme Court Allows Trump Administration to Ban Gender-Neutral Passport Designations**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday, November 6, 2025, in a 6-3 decision to allow the Trump administration to enforce a policy requiring U.S. passports to display only 'Male' or 'Female' gender markers, overturning a lower court ruling that had permitted applicants to choose an 'X' gender designation. The decision upheld the government's argument that marking a person's birth sex on a passport is akin to stating their country of birth\u2014both are factual records that do not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The majority opinion emphasized that both gender and birthplace are objective facts and do not constitute discrimination. The dissenting justices\u2014Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson, and Sonia Sotomayor\u2014called the ruling a 'meaningless but painful distortion.' The Department of Justice's Deputy Attorney General D. John Sauer argued that lower courts' rulings blocking the policy were 'unsustainable' and infringed on the President\u2019s constitutional authority in foreign affairs. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), representing transgender, non-binary, and intersex U.S. citizens, warned the new policy poses 'potential dangers' for these individuals when traveling and claimed it violates federal law and constitutional equal protection rights.

The unsigned majority opinion stated that displaying biological sex at birth is not discriminatory, as it reflects a 'historical fact' similar to listing a person's country of birth, and does not violate equal protection principles. The ruling emphasized that the government\u2019s choice to display biological sex lacks no purpose other than to harm a politically unpopular group, and that the State Department was not acting arbitrarily in following Presidential directives mandated by Congress. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, arguing that the Court failed to consider the imminent, concrete harm to plaintiffs if the policy took effect immediately, while the government offered no evidence of harm if the policy were temporarily blocked. Jackson criticized the decision as part of a recurring pattern of the Court favoring the administration on the emergency docket without equitable justification. This ruling marks the latest victory for the Trump administration on emergency appeals, including cases related to the firing of the Register of Copyrights, the termination of temporary protected status for Venezuelans, and requests to allow the firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, with a hearing scheduled for January 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 09:51 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/supreme-court/3878384/supreme-court-hands-trump-a-win-on-passport-biological-sex-rule/)\n\n**Supreme Court allows the Trump administration to enforce its transgender passport ban**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on November 6, 2025, allowed the Trump administration to enforce a policy requiring passports to display an individual's 'biological sex at birth,' effectively barring transgender and nonbinary Americans from selecting their preferred gender marker. The unsigned opinion, decided along partisan lines, stated that displaying sex at birth does not violate equal protection principles, comparing it to recording a person's country of birth as a historical fact. This reverses a 2021 Biden administration policy that allowed applicants to self-identify as male, female, or 'X' based on gender identity. The Trump administration's executive order, issued in January 2025, redefined sex as strictly binary and anatomically determined, leading to reports of transgender individuals receiving passports inconsistent with their identity, including actress Hunter Schafer. A federal judge in Massachusetts had previously blocked the order, calling it 'rooted in irrational prejudice,' but the Supreme Court's interim ruling permits enforcement while the case remains under review. All three liberal justices dissented, with Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson warning the decision 'paved the way for the immediate infliction of injury without adequate justification.'

The unsigned majority opinion stated that requiring individuals to display sex at birth does not violate equal protection principles, comparing it to the display of country of birth as a neutral historical fact. The ruling permits the government to enforce the policy while lower court litigation continues. Three liberal justices\u2014Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor\u2014dissented, with Jackson arguing the government provided no evidence of imminent harm if the policy were temporarily blocked, while transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs would suffer immediate, concrete injury. The policy stems from President Trump's January 20, 2025, executive order declaring sex as an 'immutable biological classification' and requiring government documents to reflect sex assigned at birth. The lawsuit, Orr v. Trump, was filed in February 2025 by transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, including Ashton Orr, challenging the policy as unconstitutional discrimination. Lower courts previously blocked the policy, with District Court Judge Julia Kobick initially granting temporary relief to six plaintiffs in April 2025 and later expanding the injunction to cover all transgender and gender nonconforming individuals in June 2025.

Louisiana, U.S. Supreme Court justices appeared open to limiting the consideration of race in redistricting, potentially undermining Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The case challenges Louisiana\u2019s creation of a second majority-Black congressional district in 2024, following a federal court ruling that the 2022 map was unconstitutional. Louisiana has six U.S. House seats, but only one previously favored a Black candidate despite nearly a third of its population being Black. The case has become a test of Section 2, which prohibits racial discrimination in elections. Conservative justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, questioned the permanence of race-conscious remedies and suggested modifying the Gingles test\u2014a legal framework established in Thornburg v. Gingles that determines when minority groups can claim vote dilution. Kavanaugh noted that race-based remedies should not be indefinite, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor sharply criticized the government\u2019s arguments, saying they amounted to \u2018just get rid of Section 2.\u2019 Liberal justices questioned the proposed changes, emphasizing that Section 2 is a temporary but vital tool to correct systemic racial discrimination. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund\u2019s Janai Nelson argued that Section 2 is essential for ensuring Black representation, citing historical suppression under Jim Crow laws. The case has drawn national attention, with hundreds rallying outside the Supreme Court in support of fair maps. Potential outcomes include upholding the current district, requiring a new map that preserves two majority-Black districts, or overturning the district and weakening Section 2, which could lead to states eliminating majority-minority districts. If Section 2 is weakened, states could redraw up to 19 majority-Black districts, potentially shifting power to Republicans. The court has delayed its decision until next spring, with a ruling expected by June 2026. The Louisiana Legislature is considering a special session to adjust the election qualification deadline, possibly to allow for new redistricting before the 2026 midterms. The outcome could significantly affect voting rights and representation nationwide.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 08:50 AM\nSource:[lailluminator.com](https://lailluminator.com/2025/10/15/supreme-court-seems-open-to-limiting-key-voting-rights-act-provisions-in-louisiana-redistricting-case/)\n\n**Fact Check: US House didn't pass bill automatically registering men aged 18-26 for draft**\nThe claim that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill automatically registering all men aged 18 to 26 for the draft is false and outdated. While the initial version of H.R. 8070, passed by the House on June 14, 2024, included a provision for automatic registration of men aged 18\u201325, this provision was removed before the final bill, H.R. 5009, was signed into law on December 23, 2024. The enacted legislation does not require automatic registration for men or mandate registration for women. Under current U.S. law, men aged 18 to 25 are already required to register for the Selective Service System, but no one has been drafted since the Vietnam War. The draft list serves as a contingency reserve in case of national emergency. The provision's removal reflects the bill's evolution through Senate markup and reconciliation, where controversial amendments\u2014including those on abortion, gender-affirming care, and diversity programs\u2014were excluded. The final law also did not include a requirement for women to register, despite prior proposals. The claim persists due to social media misinformation, including a TikTok video falsely stating the draft bill passed in October 2025.

This provision, however, was removed before the bill became law. The final version, H.R. 5009, signed into law by President Joe Biden on December 23, 2024, did not include automatic registration for men or a requirement for women to register. Under current U.S. law, men aged 18 to 25 are required to register for the draft, though no one has been drafted since the Vietnam War. Registration remains important for eligibility for federal jobs (under the Thurmond Amendment) and state student loans, though federal loan requirements were repealed in 2021. The Senate passed a different version of the bill on September 24, 2024, and the final law included no automatic registration or mandatory female registration.

Two key cases are highlighted: West Virginia v. B.P.J. and Little v. Hecox, which challenge state bans on transgender athletes competing in women's sports. These cases were ruled unconstitutional by the liberal Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts, but the Supreme Court may overturn those rulings. The author expresses disbelief that biological males competing in women\u2019s sports is still debated, questioning the consistency of the women\u2019s rights movement, which remains silent on the issue. The second case involves Louisiana\u2019s congressional redistricting, where a lower court mandated two Black-dominated districts, but a group sued, claiming reverse discrimination based on race\u2014a violation of the Voting Rights Act. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who previously supported such districts in 2023, now appears to believe the time limits on the law have expired. The author warns that eliminating race-based districting could shift 12 to 19 House seats toward Republicans, reducing Democratic influence. The author calls for congressional districts to reflect statewide voting patterns\u2014e.g., if Democrats receive 60% of votes, they should hold 60% of seats\u2014and urges the Court to protect women\u2019s rights by barring biological males from women\u2019s sports, locker rooms, and bathrooms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 02:30 AM\nSource:[The Daily News](https://www.galvnews.com/opinion/guest_columns/guest-commentary-supreme-court-should-protect-womens-voting-rights/article_28a11b94-724c-5992-898c-681b7a3703eb.html)\n\n**HC questions AFT authority to assess Navy gender rules**\nA full bench of the Delhi High Court, comprising Chief Justice DK Upadhyay and Justices C Hari Shankar and Om Prakash Shukla, has questioned the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT)\u2019s authority to assess the constitutional validity of Section 9 of the Navy Act, which excludes transgender individuals from Navy appointments. The court, on October 17, 2025, directed the Union Defence Ministry to clarify whether the AFT can adjudicate on the constitutionality of statutes beyond the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007. The matter stems from a petition by a former Indian Navy sailor who challenged the exclusion of transgender persons under Section 9, arguing it violates constitutional rights. The petitioner, who disclosed gender dysphoria in February 2015 and underwent gender affirmation surgery in October 2016, was confined to a psychiatric ward for five months and later discharged in October 2017, allegedly due to altered gender status and non-compliance with appearance rules. The Centre, represented by Additional Solicitor General Chetan Sharma, argued the petition was not maintainable and defended the termination on grounds of misconduct, including long hair, nail polish, eyebrow trimming, and non-compliance with service regulations. The petitioner\u2019s counsel, Trideep Pais, countered that the AFT\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to the Armed Forces Tribunal Act, 2007, and thus the petition is maintainable. The court appointed senior advocate Gautam Narayan as amicus curiae and set November 28, 2025, as the next hearing date. The court emphasized that the outcome may affect personnel across all three armed forces\u2014Army, Navy, and Air Force\u2014and mandated that instructions be provided directly by the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, or a nominated high-ranking officer.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 11:54 PM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-questions-aft-authority-to-assess-navy-gender-rules-101761591844571.html)\n\n**Women to Be Called for Military Conscription in Early 2026, MON Issues New Regulation**\nThe Polish Ministry of National Defense (MON) issued a regulation on August 27, 2025, outlining the 2026 military conscription process, which will include women for the first time. According to Article 60(2) of the Act on National Defense (March 11, 2022, Journal of Laws 2022, item 655), women with education or competencies deemed essential for national defense will be required to appear before a conscription commission. This includes female graduates of key military-relevant fields and women working in critical areas such as security and communications. The conscription process will run from February 2 to April 30, 2026, with the announcement scheduled for January 16, 2026. Regional authorities will determine specific dates for each voivodeship and county, which will be published in local notices and on official websites. Failure to appear without justification may result in a coercive fine, and authorities may involve police to enforce attendance. Under Article 681(1) of the same law, non-attendance or refusal to provide documents may lead to a fine or restriction of liberty. Exceptions are available for those with valid medical or personal reasons, provided they submit documentation and notify the military recruitment center in writing or electronically. If a person cannot attend the scheduled date due to justified reasons, they must inform the local authority by the day of the hearing. The conscription process is not equivalent to being called to active military service; it is a legal assessment of physical and mental fitness for military service, conducted by a county medical commission, which assigns an appropriate fitness category.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 04:16 AM\nSource:[Dziennik](https://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/artykuly/10509727%2Cte-kobiety-dostana-wezwanie-do-wojska-na-poczatku-przyszlego-roku-mon-wydalo-rozporzadzenie.html)\n\n**Future of Selective Service Goes to House-Senate Conference \u2013 Again**\nThe future of the Selective Service System (SSS) will be determined by a House-Senate conference committee, marking the sixth such decision in the last ten years. Despite the federal government partially shutting down in October 2025, the SSS remained operational, continuing to register young men for potential military conscription. A controversial provision in the House version of the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), approved on September 10, 2025, proposes 'automatic' draft registration using data from other federal agencies, granting the SSS unprecedented authority to collect personal information\u2014including sex assigned at birth, immigration and visa status, and current address\u2014potentially enabling surveillance and abuse, especially against immigrant and transgender youth. This provision was not included in the Senate\u2019s version of the NDAA, approved on October 10, 2025, and will be negotiated in closed-door conference talks. A bipartisan amendment to repeal the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) was introduced but blocked by the House Rules Committee. Meanwhile, the Biden administration had planned to update SSS regulations in early 2025, but the effort was frozen under President Trump\u2019s regulatory freeze. Additionally, draft board vacancies\u2014many lacking quorums or members from all jurisdictions\u2014have rendered numerous local and appeal boards nonfunctional, and the SSS has paused new applications for board membership without explanation.

A controversial proposal within the House version of the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would mandate automatic draft registration based on sex assigned at birth and require immigration and visa status information, granting the SSS unprecedented access to personal data from all federal agencies. Activists, including Edward Hasbrouck of Antiwar.com, warn this power would be dangerously unworkable and prone to abuse, particularly against immigrant and transgender youth. The proposal also includes changes to draft board structures, such as allowing on-demand applications for board membership, but no new appointments have been made due to a continued freeze under President Trump\u2019s administration. Current draft board members remain in place until their terms end, but vacancies are growing, threatening the system\u2019s ability to function in a crisis.

The case was heard before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where judges expressed skepticism about overturning the 1981 Supreme Court precedent in Rostker v. Goldberg, which upheld the male-only system based on women\u2019s exclusion from combat roles. Lewis argued that since the combat exclusion was lifted in 2013 and all military roles were opened to women by 2016, the rationale for the law is outdated. However, the panel, including judges Johnnie B. Rawlinson, Anthony Johnstone, and Eric Miller, emphasized that only the Supreme Court can overrule its own precedent. The government argued that the male plaintiffs lack standing, as they have already registered and face no ongoing harm, and the complaint failed to identify specific individuals likely to be affected by future moves. The panel also questioned the plaintiffs\u2019 intent\u2014whether they seek to include women or exclude men\u2014highlighting ambiguity in the legal goal. The court did not indicate a timeline for its decision. This is not the first challenge: a similar case was dismissed by the Fifth Circuit in 2020, and the Supreme Court declined to review it in 2021. A 2020 congressional commission recommended expanding draft registration to women, and in 2021, armed service committees voted to include them, but the provision was dropped due to backlash.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 09:51 PM\nSource:[Court House News Service](https://www.courthousenews.com/men-renew-challenge-to-male-only-draft-rule-before-ninth-circuit/)\n\n**Point: Another momentous term is in the offing**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's upcoming term, beginning October 6, 2025, is expected to address several landmark cases with broad national implications.

Callais,' which involves redistricting after the 2020 census, where Louisiana created one majority-Black congressional district, and a federal court ordered a second, prompting a lawsuit over racial gerrymandering; the Supreme Court has ordered new oral arguments to determine whether intentional race-based districting violates the 14th or 15th Amendments, with nationwide implications for redistricting; and 'National Republican Senatorial Committee v.

The author cites that the Army missed its 2022 recruitment goal by nearly 30,000 recruits, the worst shortfall in half a century, and that the Pentagon has spent taxpayer dollars on \"unconscious bias\" workshops, equity training, and pronoun guidance. The piece claims that Biden\u2011era policies have eroded readiness, noting that the Air Force set a 2022 goal to reduce white\u2011male applicants in the ROTC and target specific numbers for other racial and gender groups. It praises the Trump administration\u2019s reversal, pointing out that the Army exceeded its 2025 recruitment goal and female enlistment surged. The article calls for the NDAA to ban the Chief Diversity Office, all DEI training, quotas, and data collection, prohibit race and gender as factors in academy admissions and promotions, and return selection boards to merit\u2011based decisions. It also demands that the Senate version of the NDAA ban sex\u2011change surgeries, hormone therapy, and other transition procedures, and that the military eliminate critical race theory, drag shows, social\u2011media accounts that distract from readiness, and ideological banners. The author concludes that if DEI remains, it will grow again, urging Congress to \"kill DEI before it kills military readiness,\" and to keep the military race\u2011neutral, sex\u2011neutral, and focused solely on capability.

The SSS proposal is included in the FY2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) reported by the House Armed Services Committee; the alternative to abolish the SSS is contained in more than a thousand amendments to the same bill. The House Rules Committee will meet the week of September\u202f8\u202f2025 to decide which amendments will be voted on. Opponents are urged to co\u2011sponsor Amendment\u202f231 to H.R.\u202f3838, which would repeal the Military Selective Service Act. The current law, in effect since 1980, requires all male residents aged 18\u201125 to register and report address changes within 10 days. Compliance is low; the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee said \u2018absolutely nobody\u2019 tells the SSS when they move. The SSS database is incomplete and \u2018less than useless\u2019 for a draft, according to the former director. The proposed automatic registration would override the Privacy Act and the Computer Matching Act, granting the SSS broad authority to pull data from all other federal agencies. The article argues that such a system would be error\u2011prone, dangerous, and effectively a covert data grab, and that abolishing the SSS would constrain war\u2011makers. It calls for anti\u2011militarists to support repeal and for privacy advocates to oppose the expansion of federal data\u2011aggregation authority.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 12:28 PM\nSource:[Antiwar.com](https://www.antiwar.com/blog/2025/09/05/house-considers-whether-to-end-or-try-to-automate-draft-registration/)\n\n**The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly In Congress's New NDAA**\nThe House and Senate have released their versions of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which aims to reform the military and address issues such as social experimentation and manipulation. The House version includes a provision that requires military personnel actions to be based on individual merit, fitness, capability, and performance, and prohibits consideration of race, ethnicity, or national origin. However, it could be improved by prohibiting consideration of sex and religious preferences, defining key terms, and including reasonable exceptions. The Senate version does not have a similar provision. Section 548 of the Senate bill forbids men from participating in women's sports at the service academies and defines 'sex' based on reproductive biology and genetics. However, it only applies to the service academies and should be expanded to all DOD Education Activity schools. Both the House and Senate versions have begun dismantling the diversity, equity, and inclusion bureaucracy in the Pentagon, and have addressed the scandal of race and sex preferences in service academy admissions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 11:37 AM\nSource:[The Federalist](https://thefederalist.com/2025/07/22/heres-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-in-congresss-new-defense-bill/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All nine experts across diverse fields (public policy, legislative affairs, military policy, political science, law, and gender studies) independently converge on a very low probability that women will be required to register for US Selective Service before January 1, 2026. Their forecasts, ranging from 2% to 5%, cite the following common factors: recent and repeated removal of female registration provisions from the NDAA in the final stages (conference committee); the dominance of a political climate under the Trump administration that is hostile to expanding gender-based legal obligations; ongoing judicial deference that leaves the matter to Congress (with courts showing no urgency to intervene); strong legislative inertia and status quo bias; lack of public or advocacy group mobilization on the issue; and Selective Service operational dysfunction. While some experts acknowledge international trends toward gender-neutral conscription in peer countries, they agree US policy change is driven by domestic politics and such trends have limited impact. All identify that the only plausible pathway to a 'Yes' outcome would be a major external shock (such as a large-scale national security crisis) prompting a legislative about-face and rapid implementation, but there is presently no sign of any such event. The group consensus is that, given all structural, political, and institutional barriers, the status quo will almost certainly persist through the close of 2025.",
