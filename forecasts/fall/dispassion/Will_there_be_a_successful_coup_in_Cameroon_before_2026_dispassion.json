While the regional context has seen a spike in coups, Cameroon has unique features: a deeply entrenched, personalist regime, a security sector with strong incentives to preserve the status quo, and a history of successful elite management by Biya. The main opposition leader is in exile and unable to directly mobilize armed support. There are no credible reports of military uprisings, mutinies, or units siding with protesters. The advanced age of Biya and lack of a clear succession plan marginally increase the risk of elite instability, but this is offset by the regime's demonstrated capacity for violent repression and elite co-optation. Given these factors, the likelihood of a successful coup (as defined by the resolution criteria) before January 1, 2026, remains significantly below the level implied by headlines or protest intensity alone.

Second, Biya's advanced age and the absence of clear succession mechanisms introduce a rare degree of uncertainty that, even in tightly controlled autocracies, can precipitate rapid shifts\u2014especially when regime cohesion is stressed by mass unrest and international condemnation.

Critiques of lower single-digit probabilities noted that the current crisis (severity of unrest, succession ambiguity, and regional coup precedent) justifies a mild upward adjustment from pure base rates, but not enough for a major increase, since acute warning indicators are absent. Thus, there is no compelling new evidence to justify moving away from my initial upper-bound estimate. I will hold at 13%.",

Some forecasters, particularly those using indicator-based or fragile state frameworks, assigned slightly higher probabilities (up to 13%), citing the unprecedented scale of post-election unrest and Biya's advanced age. However, critiques consistently noted that while unrest is severe, the absence of actionable indicators of a coup and the continued loyalty of the security apparatus justify a forecast at the lower end of the plausible range. A modest argument could be made for a 1-2% increase, but the evidence does not support a material upward revision. The dominant scenario remains regime survival through repression and elite management until at least the resolution date.",

The arguments for a slightly higher risk (low teens) emphasize the unprecedented scale of unrest and Biya\u2019s age/succession ambiguity, but these are offset by the decisive absence of acute triggers\u2014there are no credible reports of mutiny, elite splits, or coup plotting. Given the short time window and the regime\u2019s demonstrated ability to suppress severe crises, the base rate and current indicators justify a probability in the 7-9% range.

While several peers noted the unprecedented scale of the post-election crisis and Biya's age as elevating factors, none identified any new evidence of imminent military plotting or elite fracture. Some, such as CivilMilitaryRelationsTheory and SecuritySectorGovernance, argue for an even lower probability, while others (PostcolonialStateDynamics) concur that risk is higher than baseline but still solidly in the low teens at most. The consensus is toward a slightly lower or status quo probability than my initial estimate. In light of this, and the short time window, I see no compelling reason to revise upward and find a modest downward revision justified, mainly to reflect the absence of actionable warning indicators of a coup.",

Opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary, a former ally of Biya, claims he is the rightful winner and has called for continued rallies and civil disobedience. HRW reported that while some protests involved violence and attacks on police, the state response included 'lethal force and mass arrests' of protesters and civilians. At least six individuals are detained at the State Defence Secretariat in Yaound\u00e9, a facility where HRW has 'documented routine use of torture.' Ilaria Allegrozzi, a senior HRW Africa researcher, stated, 'The violent crackdown on protesters and ordinary citizens across Cameroon lays bare a deepening pattern of repression that casts a dark cloud over the election.' She urged authorities to immediately release those detained for peaceful protest, investigate and prosecute security forces responsible for abuses, and ensure fair trials for those involved in violent acts.

Ilaria Allegrozzi, HRW\u2019s Africa researcher, stated that the crackdown reveals a deepening repression casting a 'dark cloud' over the election. Authorities claimed to have arrested 'several hundred' people, with one group of 149 volunteer lawyers estimating up to 2,000 detainees, including minors. HRW expressed concern that some were held in a detention center where systematic torture has been documented. Allegrozzi demanded the immediate release of all individuals detained for peaceful protest or expressing opposition to the government, emphasizing that any violence must be prosecuted appropriately with full due process.

According to HRW\u2019s report released in Nairobi, police and gendarmes fired live ammunition and tear gas to disperse opposition-led protests challenging the re-election of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who was declared the winner with 53.66% of the vote on October 27.

Tchiroma, who contested the election and claims he was the rightful winner despite official results declaring President Paul Biya the victor, made the demand in a video posted on social media on November 10, 2025. He stated, 'I will never lower my stance until my people are free,' and accused security forces of unjust arrests during post-election protests. The election, which saw 92-year-old Biya declared the winner by the Constitutional Court, has triggered widespread unrest. Biya, who has ruled Cameroon for 43 years, was sworn in for an eighth term, extending his presidency for another seven years. According to the United Nations, at least 48 people were killed in post-election violence, with many believed to have been shot by police during clashes with protesters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 05:09 AM\nSource:[allafrica.com](https://allafrica.com/stories/202511100054.html)\n\n**Africa should abolish polls and return to fiefdoms and monarchies**\nThe article argues that elections in Africa are systematically flawed and often fraudulent, citing historical and recent examples to advocate for abolishing polls and reverting to fiefdoms and monarchies. It references Charles Dunbar Burgess King\u2019s 1927 Liberian presidential election, where he received 230,000 votes out of a registered electorate of 19,000\u20141,211% of votes\u2014highlighting a pattern of electoral fraud. The piece then details recent elections in Tanzania, where President Samia Suluhu won 98% of the vote amid widespread suppression of opposition, including the imprisonment of opposition leader Tundu Lissu on treason charges and the disqualification of candidate Luhaga Mpina. In Ivory Coast, President Alassane Ouattara secured 91% of the vote, while in Cameroon, 92-year-old Paul Biya won with 54% despite health concerns and a warning from his daughter against voting for him. Tunisia\u2019s Kais Saied won 90.69% amid repression, and the Central African Republic\u2019s Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra assumed power through a disputed 2020 election. In Guinea, military leader Mamadi Doumbouya is expected to oversee elections, raising concerns about manipulation. In Uganda, opposition leaders Kizza Besigye and Bobi Wine face imprisonment and state violence, suggesting a sham process. The article predicts Kenya\u2019s 2026 election as the 'grand finale' of this cycle, warning that without reform, Africa should abandon elections and return to fiefdoms and monarchies. The author concludes with a satirical yet critical tone, calling the current system 'madness' and questioning the legitimacy of electoral processes across the continent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 03:10 AM\nSource:[Standard Digital News - Kenya](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/opinion/article/2001534050/africa-should-abolish-polls-and-return-to-fiefdoms-and-monarchies)\n\n**After Them, the Flood: The Struggle to Uphold Democratic Rule in Africa**\nThe article, published on November 13, 2025, by Tunisian political thinker and philosophy professor Mohamed Ben Salem, analyzes the persistent instability in Africa due to political leaders' prolonged retention of power. It highlights that peaceful transitions of power are rare across African nations. The piece cites examples such as Ivory Coast\u2019s President Alassane Ouattara, who secured a fourth term with 89.77% of votes amid widespread suppression of opposition and broken promises; Tanzania\u2019s Samia Suluhu Hassan, who won 97.66% of votes following a violent election aftermath in which over 700 people were killed; Cameroon\u2019s Paul Biya, who has ruled for 42 years; and other long-serving leaders including Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma (Togo, 20 years), Denis Sassou Nguesso (Congo, 40 years), Paul Kagame (Rwanda, 31 years), and Teodoro Obiang Nguema (Equatorial Guinea, 45 years). The author argues that these leaders lack genuine public respect based on achievements, and their grip on power has undermined democratic development. Instead, elections have become theatrical performances followed by cycles of violence, ethnic polarization, and civil conflict, as seen in Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan. The article calls for a redefinition of elections as forums for policy debate rather than personal rivalry, emphasizing the need to cultivate democratic values, civic responsibility, and peaceful conflict resolution. It stresses that democracy requires mutual recognition, continuous negotiation, and respect for the rule of law\u2014qualities absent in many African autocratic regimes.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:50 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/opinion/%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%91%D9%83-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**HRW slams Cameroon killings, arrests after disputed vote**\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has condemned Cameroon for lethal force and mass arrests following widespread protests against the disputed re-election of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, declared the winner on October 12, 2025.

Biya was inaugurated on November 6, 2024. On November 9, Tchiroma broke his silence with a video message accusing the regime of 'state-sponsored terrorism,' 'ethnic cleansing,' and arbitrary arrests. He demanded the release of all political detainees within 48 hours. Despite speculation that Nigerian authorities may be restricting his movements to preserve relations with Yaound\u00e9, Tchiroma has signaled his intent to continue an escalating confrontation that has moved beyond legal channels into a protracted war of attrition. He has organized violent protests, resulting in deaths and destruction of commercial infrastructure, which he claims were caused by infiltrated agents. He also called for a three-day general strike under the slogan 'Ghost City,' though responses were inconsistent. Tchiroma threatened to target prisons, stating that after 48 hours, the Cameroonian people would have the right to defend themselves and reclaim their members by all means. This escalation follows a wave of arrests of his supporters across the country, with unclear reasons and identities of detainees. According to Tchiroma\u2019s lawyer, 121 people\u2014including 9 minors\u2014are being held at police and gendarmerie centers in Yaound\u00e9, while about 30 others were transferred to Ntuyi in the Centre Region after detention at Central Police Station No. 1. The stated goal of these detentions is to isolate Tchiroma and dismantle his networks. President Biya, drawing on decades of experience in silencing political rivals\u2014such as John Fru Ndi in 1992 and Maurice Kamto in 2018\u2014faces opposition with confidence, relying on institutional legitimacy and a planned routine cabinet reshuffle. He has maintained a low political profile, appearing only in routine state ceremonies and issuing no new political statements beyond his inauguration speech. Despite control over the military and administration, the regime acknowledges that the war of attrition could strain the already struggling economy, potentially undermining political stability. Minister of Regional Administration Paul Atanga Nji is leading a hardline approach, while Biya praised security forces in a speech despite credible allegations from human rights organizations that they used live ammunition against protesters, resulting in dozens of deaths.

In a nearly five-minute social media speech, Bakary urged 92-year-old incumbent President Paul Biya\u2014Africa\u2019s longest-serving head of state, in power for 43 years\u2014to concede, stating, 'Our victory is clear. It must be respected.' Bakary, a former transport and communication minister under Biya, resigned from government in June 2025 and launched a surprise presidential bid, accusing Biya\u2019s administration of mismanaging the country\u2019s oil and cocoa wealth and failing to deliver basic services. His campaign gained momentum with endorsements from a coalition of opposition parties and civic groups known as the Union for Change, which supports him as a transitional leader to carry out institutional audits and reforms. Despite his claims, official results remain pending, as Cameroon\u2019s Constitutional Council has until October 26, 2025, to validate and release the final tally. The government, through Minister of Territorial Administration Paul Atanga Nji, has warned that any unilateral announcement of results constitutes 'high treason.' Bakary\u2019s political transformation\u2014from loyalist and former spokesperson for Biya to opposition challenger\u2014marks one of the most dramatic shifts in Cameroon\u2019s recent political history. His candidacy has energized a population weary of over four decades of Biya\u2019s rule, during which economic development has stagnated. Bakary, born in Garoua and trained as a railway engineer in France, was imprisoned in the 1980s for alleged involvement in a coup attempt and entered parliament in 1992, aligning with Biya\u2019s Cameroon People's Democratic Movement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/africa/2025-10-14-cameroons-issa-tchiroma-bakary-claims-presidential-election-victory)\n\n**Cameroon's Paul Biya Seeks Eighth Term at 92**\nPaul Biya, the 92-year-old President of Cameroon, is seeking an eighth term in the presidential election held on October 12, 2025, which is widely expected to result in his re-election. Biya, who has ruled since 1982, will become the first head of state to serve past the age of 100 if he completes his seventh term. Cameroon's presidential term is seven years with no term limits, enabling indefinite re-election. In the previous election, Biya received 71% of the vote. This election featured 11 opposition candidates, but the most prominent was barred from running after the electoral commission rejected his registration, a decision upheld by the constitutional council, leaving Biya without meaningful competition. He conducted minimal campaigning. Biya\u2019s rule reflects a broader trend in Africa, where five of the world\u2019s seven longest-serving presidents are African. These include Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea (46 years), Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo (46 years), Yoweri Museveni of Uganda (40 years), Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea (since 1993 without elections), and Salva Kiir Mayardit of South Sudan (since 2011, delaying elections). Experts attribute the persistence of long-serving leaders to historical, geopolitical, and social factors, including the use of patronage networks, suppression of dissent, and the portrayal of leaders as national liberators. While some leaders have been ousted recently\u2014such as the Bongo family in Gabon (2023), Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe (2017), and Omar al-Bashir in Sudan (2019)\u2014there are signs of change: Seychelles saw a peaceful opposition victory in 2025, and Senegal\u2019s President Macky Sall stepped down after mass protests in 2024.

At 92 years old, Biya seeks to extend his presidency through 2032, which would make him 99 at the end of his term. Over eight million voters, including 34,000 abroad, participated in 31,000 polling centers. Results are expected by October 26, though opposition groups have raised concerns about unequal conditions and lack of transparency. Biya, who has been in power since 1982 after the resignation of Ahmadou Ahidjo, has won all seven elections since then. While his rule has brought formal political stability, it has also been marked by accusations of authoritarianism, repression, and corruption. Biya stated, 'The challenges we face are increasingly urgent. In such a situation, I cannot evade my mission,' without presenting a concrete program. His health, which has drawn persistent speculation due to his frequent stays in Europe, remains a concern, with real governance falling to his inner circle and senior officials of the ruling RDPC party. He faces nine opposition candidates, including Bello Bouba Maigari and Issa Tchiroma Bakary\u2014former allies now critical of his rule\u2014who draw support in the impoverished, conflict-ridden northern regions affected by Boko Haram and cross-border armed groups. Additionally, Cameroon is experiencing a separatist conflict in the English-speaking west, where Anglophone separatists demand autonomy from the Francophone-dominated state.

Despite ongoing questions about his health, he is running for an eighth term. As October 3 is a public holiday in Germany (German Unity Day), Deutsche Welle is offering a special broadcast focusing on the stakes of this election. To maintain power for over 40 years, Biya has relied on a mix of political strategy, centralization of authority, and a repressive system. His main opposition is fragmented, with 11 candidates initially approved, but the field has narrowed due to withdrawals and endorsements. Most Cameroonian citizens do not believe a democratic transition will occur in 2025, and neither the ruling RDPC party nor the broader country is prepared for a post-Biya era.

Biya has been in power for 43 years and would be one of the oldest and longest-serving leaders on the continent if he completes another term. According to Thabang, 'Some of the challenges of African development reside in the reluctance of leaders to leave power, even when their term is long expired.' Thabang also notes that 'the plague of African leadership is rooted in the negative ideology of long-term power, often referred to as dictatorship or autocracy in some states.' The article highlights the consequences of such leadership, including underdevelopment, dictatorship, elite domination, and corruption. It also warns that the return of Biya to power could lead to instability and coups, as seen in neighboring countries like Mali and Burkina Faso. Thabang concludes that 'this type of leadership does not favor African development, it weakens democratic institutions and alienates the population.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[cameroun24.net](https://cameroun24.net/actualite-cameroun-Un_universitaire_alerte___Le_long_regne_de_Biya_au-4-4-70082.html)\n\n**Paul Biya: Towards an Eighth Term?**\nPaul Biya, the 91-year-old President of Cameroon, is one of the last dinosaurs of African politics still in power. He has been in office since 1982, making him one of the longest-serving heads of state in the world. As the presidential election approaches on October 12, a question is being asked: will Biya run for an eighth term? The opposition is weakened and divided, while the population is resigned to the current situation. Biya's regime has consolidated its power through constitutional reforms, the abolition of term limits, and tight control over institutions. The 2008 constitutional amendment removed the two-term limit for presidents, allowing for indefinite re-elections. Although there has been no official announcement, several indicators suggest that the regime is preparing the ground for Biya's new candidacy. The ruling party, RDPC, has stated that Biya remains the 'best choice', while his potential successor, his son Franck Biya, has not been clearly designated. Biya's silence on the matter has maintained the ambiguity, reinforcing the regime's control. At 91, Biya's advanced age raises questions about his ability to lead the country, which faces numerous challenges, including insecurity in Anglophone regions, persistent poverty, endemic corruption, and irregular economic growth. The question of succession becomes crucial, but is carefully avoided by the regime, fueling internal tensions. If Biya were to run for re-election, it would be his eighth term, prolonging a rule that raises numerous criticisms on democratic and ethical grounds. Such a candidacy would also pose problems in terms of medium-term stability, particularly in the event of a sudden power vacuum. Cameroon is at a crossroads, between the perpetuation of a personal power and the people's aspiration for change. The upcoming election will be decisive.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 06:51 AM\nSource:[settimananews.it](https://www.settimananews.it/informazione-internazionale/paul-biya-verso-un-ottavo-mandato/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the probability of a successful coup in Cameroon before January 1, 2026, is assessed to be low, broadly falling within the 6-13% range. Experts consistently emphasize the extraordinary durability of Paul Biya's regime, underscored by long-standing patronage networks, cohesive security forces, and effective coup-proofing, despite acute post-election unrest (with mass arrests, violence, and protests) following the October 2025 presidential election. While factors such as Biya's advanced age, lack of a clear succession plan, widespread civil unrest, and a recent regional wave of coups slightly elevate risk above historical baselines, all analysts note the absence of key precursors for a successful coup: visible elite or military splits, security force defections, or clear evidence of organized armed opposition. The opposition remains fragmented and lacks military backing, and international actors have neither encouraged nor signaled support for a coup. Differences among experts revolve mainly around how much Biya's age-related succession ambiguity and regional coup contagion elevate risk, but there is consensus that the regime's institutional entrenchment and security sector loyalty are decisive barriers. Most likely, the regime continues to repress dissent through 2025, with no armed group seizing state power for the necessary 7 days per resolution criteria. The probability of a coup before 2026, by nearly all accounts, is higher than in most years of Biya's rule due to the severity of the current crisis, but still remains well below 20% and clustered around 7-13%.",
