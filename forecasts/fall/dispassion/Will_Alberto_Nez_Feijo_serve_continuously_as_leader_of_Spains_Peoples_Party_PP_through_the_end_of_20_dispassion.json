However, several converging factors (the Maz\u00f3n scandal, visible internal dissent, negative polling, and the rise of Vox) put Feij\u00f3o at significant risk. The most likely scenario is that the party delays a leadership change until after the political calendar turns, unless a major trigger event (such as a public revolt by regional leaders or a disastrous resolution of the Valencian situation) forces their hand. The absence of a clear, consensus replacement and the proximity to year-end increase the odds Feij\u00f3o survives.

Elite Theory may understate the possibility of a 'bandwagon' effect: if just one or two influential regional leaders (like Ayuso) publicly break ranks, latent dissent could rapidly coalesce. Given the acute, multi-front stress on Feij\u00f3o's leadership and the existence of near-term party executive meetings, the risk of sudden elite mobilization, though still less likely than stasis, is higher than in typical periods of opposition inertia.

The Maz\u00f3n crisis is not only an internal party issue but also a coalition management failure with national implications, and the escalating competition with Vox creates a feedback loop of instability that can accelerate party fragmentation. While the lack of a unified challenger is a stabilizing factor, it is possible for a party to enter a caretaker or interim leader phase if the crisis becomes unmanageable\u2014especially if coalition breakdowns spark calls for emergency action.

Critiques of the Parliamentary Stability perspective highlighted the possibility of a rapid, caretaker leadership transition if the crisis sharply escalates\u2014an argument I find persuasive, as it shows the risk of a 'bandwagon effect' is not negligible. However, no new evidence or group argument justifies a significant revision downward; if anything, the consensus affirms that my original 70% estimate is appropriately calibrated for the present uncertainty and time frame.",

The critiques raised\u2014particularly from the Executive Stability Assessment perspective\u2014emphasize the possibility of a 'black swan' event triggered by the Maz\u00f3n/Valencia crisis and upcoming party executive meetings, suggesting that the current context is even more precarious than in standard PP turbulence. On the other hand, defenses of base rate and status quo bias from elite theory, party leadership change monitoring, and intra-party democracy perspectives corroborate the resilience of party inertia and the shortness of the time frame. Considering these deliberations, I believe my initial probability may slightly overestimate the stabilizing effect of the short time horizon and party inertia, and slightly underestimate the potential for cascading elite dissent in the face of acute crisis. I am therefore revising my probability downward by a modest margin, in recognition of the real but still less likely risk of a rapid leadership change.",

This move surprised both G\u00e9nova (the headquarters of the People's Party) and the broader political landscape, as the right-wing coalition with Vox had previously been dismissed as non-replicable elsewhere. The decision backfired, as the fallout from Maz\u00f3n's leadership has now severely damaged the People's Party (PP), particularly under Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o. Feij\u00f3o, who was brought to Madrid to replace Pablo Casado as PP leader, has failed to address the crisis, with the situation worsening due to ongoing judicial investigations involving Maz\u00f3n and the PP\u2019s secretary of Organization. The party\u2019s credibility has eroded further, especially after the state funeral for Pilar Bernab\u00e9, where the PSOE regained public trust by handling victims with dignity. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s reluctance to intervene in the Valencian government crisis\u2014despite having the authority\u2014has been attributed to his respect for regional barons, but this has led to a loss of control over the political narrative. The PP now faces a difficult recovery in a key region, while Feij\u00f3o\u2019s inability to manage multiple fronts, including the Senate investigation into PSOE corruption and the growing influence of Vox, has exposed his strategic shortcomings. The crisis has exploded at the worst possible moment, with Vox emboldened by polls and public sentiment turned against the PP.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 04:34 AM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/espana/2025-11-03/a-feijoo-le-estalla-mazon-en-las-manos.html)\n\n**Feij\u00f3o Tries to Resolve Valencia Crisis Amid Tensions with Vox**\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, leader of the Spanish People's Party (PP), faced one of his most challenging days as opposition leader on November 3, 2025, amid a deepening crisis in the Valencia region. The PP confirmed that Feij\u00f3o had held multiple conversations with Carlos Maz\u00f3n, the President of the Valencian Community and leader of the PP in Valencia, who was expected to announce his decision on a personal reflection process following the first anniversary of the deadly 'Dana' storm that caused over 200 deaths. The crisis intensified after exclusive revelations by the newspaper Levante (Grupo Prensa Ib\u00e9rica), which reported that Maz\u00f3n stayed with journalist Maribel Vilaplana after a three-hour meeting and accompanied her to her car parking, contradicting his earlier statement. Maz\u00f3n\u2019s departure from the PP project is now certain, though details remain unresolved. Feij\u00f3o seeks a resolution to the Valencia crisis to move forward, a task complicated by the fact that Maz\u00f3n depends on Vox, the party with which he recently formed a coalition government. Santiago Abascal of Vox openly blamed Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez for the disaster, criticizing the PP for failing to defend its own, worsening relations between the two right-wing parties. Vox sources stated they would not support any candidate who does not meet their conditions, referencing Extremadura\u2019s early elections. The possibility of early elections in Valencia, which could disrupt the electoral calendar\u2014initially calm for the PP but challenging for the left\u2014adds further pressure. Feij\u00f3o faces a difficult choice: either accept Vox\u2019s demands at a time of strained relations, or retain Maz\u00f3n, whose continued leadership is politically untenable. Potential successors include Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Catal\u00e1, the mayor of Valencia (and a member of parliament), and Juan Francisco P\u00e9rez Llorca, the PP valencian secretary general, but not Vicente Momp\u00f3, who is not a member of parliament. This crisis marks Feij\u00f3o\u2019s first major confrontation with a regional baron, highlighting tensions dating back to Maz\u00f3n\u2019s early 2023 coalition with Vox, which many in G\u00e9nova blamed for the PP\u2019s poor performance in the July 2023 general election.

Despite a year-long resistance to stepping down\u2014supported tacitly or critically by the national PP leadership\u2014Maz\u00f3n has faced mounting scrutiny due to contradictions in his statements, his handling of the aftermath of the 2024 flood disaster, and ongoing legal concerns about irregular financing. The controversy has undermined Feij\u00f3o\u2019s national strategy and created internal tensions within the PP. The party is attempting to prevent a leadership change imposed from Madrid that would install a leader not aligned with regional interests. Feij\u00f3o aims to reach a consensual and peaceful resolution, with a National Executive Committee meeting scheduled in Madrid for the next day. Key uncertainties remain: whether Vox will support a new investiture if Maz\u00f3n resigns, who would lead the new candidacy, and whether an autonomous party congress will be held, a move many regional leaders consider necessary.

L\u00f3pez accused Feij\u00f3o of lacking concrete political proposals, describing his leadership as weak and increasingly resembling that of former PP leader Pablo Casado. He argued that Ayuso drains Feij\u00f3o\u2019s political energy by counter-programming and forcing G\u00e9nova (PP headquarters) to respond to her actions. L\u00f3pez further claimed the PP is attempting to 'fill the electoral calendar' with regional elections to avoid scrutiny of its leadership crisis. He accused Feij\u00f3o of pursuing 'ultra-politics' that mimic Vox\u2019s radicalism, citing figures like Miguel Tellado and Ester Mu\u00f1oz as key allies. L\u00f3pez dismissed the PP\u2019s current trajectory as 'truly pathetic,' noting that a once-great party now looks to Manos Limpias\u2014a watchdog group\u2014as its guiding force.

He argues that the current dominance of the People's Party (PP) and Vox has created a 'democratic anomaly' in the region, with 38 years of right-wing governance and a lack of political alternation. Mart\u00ednez warns that if the region turns to 'the little lord of the Innocents'\u2014a reference to the far-right\u2014'we\u2019re going to be screwed.' He emphasizes the need for the PSOE to become the leading force and proposes a pact where the party with the most votes governs, aiming to block far-right influence. Despite low poll numbers for the PSOE, Mart\u00ednez insists on focusing on policy and project over image, citing his record in Soria and the need to mobilize the 30% of voters who typically abstain. He criticizes PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o for mimicking far-right rhetoric and undermining institutional cooperation, noting that 14 PP-governed regions have boycotted key national conferences. Mart\u00ednez denies any pact with Vox, clarifying that a recent law on public advertising was about transparency and regulation, not collaboration. He rejects localist parties like Soria Ya! and Uni\u00f3n del Pueblo Leon\u00e9s, arguing they serve right-wing interests. He stresses the importance of national left-wing alliances across regions like Arag\u00f3n and Extremadura to counter regional fragmentation and right-wing consolidation. The PSOE's challenge, he says, is to move beyond localism and build a long-term, inclusive project for rural and marginalized communities.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 10:01 PM\nSource:[eldiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/castilla-y-leon/carlos-martinez-castilla-leon-si-senorito-santos-inocentes-ultraderecha-jodidos_128_12716135.html)\n\n**The Domino Effect: PP\u2019s Strategic Move in Extremadura to Challenge Vox**\nMar\u00eda Guardiola, President of the Regional Government of Extremadura, has triggered a political dissolution of the regional parliament (Las Cortes) following a second consecutive rejection by the PSOE and Vox of the regional budget, aligning with a strategy previously used by other regional presidents such as Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso (Madrid, 2021), Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco (Castilla y Le\u00f3n, 2022), and Juanma Moreno (Andaluc\u00eda, 2022). The move is part of a broader effort by the People's Party (PP) under Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o to create a domino effect across Spain, aiming to weaken Vox and position the PP as the dominant force in upcoming elections. The PP believes that the political deadlock in Extremadura\u2014where the regional government was unable to pass even basic legislation\u2014justifies the dissolution, and they emphasize that the decision must be perceived as driven by regional necessity rather than party strategy. Despite favorable polls predicting a PP victory with a significant lead, the outcome remains uncertain: even with a plurality, the PP may still require support from Vox or the Greens to govern, meaning the party's influence would remain constrained. The PP is cautious about raising expectations, focusing instead on winning elections. Observers note that success in Extremadura could influence future regional and national elections, with Feij\u00f3o seeking to use the region as a launching point for broader political change. The PP's messaging highlights the national political paralysis under Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, who has failed to pass a budget and continues to focus on amnesty for 'proc\u00e9s' leaders, positioning Guardiola\u2019s move as a necessary response to a broken system.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:14 AM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/espana/efecto-domino-noquear-vox-via-extremena_20251029690167fac7155f09f1b0f636.html)\n\n**When Does the Campaign Begin? Can Early Elections Occur in Other Regions? Key Points on Extremadura\u2019s Elections**\nExtremadura's President Mar\u00eda Guardiola announced the early regional election on October 27, 2025, after her budget was rejected by both the PSOE and Unidas Podemos, as well as her former coalition partner, Vox, which submitted total amendments. Guardiola stated that if opposition parties continued blocking the budget, it would be the people of Extremadura who would decide the region's future. She gave PSOE and PP until October 28 to withdraw their amendments and allow negotiation, but later held an emergency press conference to confirm the early election. She emphasized her commitment to transforming Extremadura and driving regional growth, rejecting political posturing. The decision had been previously communicated to the national PP leadership, which approved it; PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o praised Guardiola\u2019s 'responsibility and courage' for prioritizing the people over political gridlock. The relationship between Guardiola and Vox had been strained since the 2023 regional elections, when she formed a coalition despite ideological differences, including Vox\u2019s positions on gender violence, immigration, and LGBTQ+ rights. She had previously stated she could not allow those who deny gender violence or dehumanize immigrants into government. The coalition collapsed nearly a year later due to national disagreements over the distribution of unaccompanied migrant minors from the Canary Islands. Vox withdrew from all regional governments, including Extremadura\u2019s, though its minister Ignacio Higuero remained until August 2025, when he resigned after being found to have falsified his university degree. Since then, Guardiola has had to negotiate every parliamentary vote individually.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[RTVE.es](https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20251027/claves-fechas-elecciones-autonomicas-extremadura/16789028.shtml)\n\n**Maz\u00f3n's Spiral of Inconsistencies Entraps Feij\u00f3o as PP Fears His Re-election Could Derail Moncloa Ambitions**\nCarlos Maz\u00f3n, the president of the Valencian Community, remains in office one year after the DANA disaster, which resulted in 229 deaths and left thousands of families devastated. Despite widespread private skepticism within the People's Party (PP), no senior PP leader believes Maz\u00f3n can politically 'reanimate' himself or repeat as a candidate. While some believe he may serve out the remainder of the legislative term, none expect him to run again. His shifting narratives about his handling of the disaster have created a spiral of inconsistencies that now entangles PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, who faces pressure to resolve the leadership issue. Although publicly the PP emphasizes monitoring reconstruction progress and regional polling, privately, party officials agree Maz\u00f3n is unlikely to repeat as candidate. Concerns are growing that an early general election called by Pedro S\u00e1nchez could force Feij\u00f3o to act before the leadership transition is resolved. The situation is complicated by Feij\u00f3o\u2019s reliance on Vox, which is poised to approve Maz\u00f3n\u2019s budget, thereby reinforcing Maz\u00f3n\u2019s political survival. This dynamic risks diverting attention from judicial issues involving S\u00e1nchez\u2019s allies and deepening internal tensions within the PP.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:57 PM\nSource:[LaSexta](https://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/espiral-incongruencias-mazon-atrapa-feijoo-voces-temen-que-pueda-frenar-llegada-moncloa_2025102768ff6c294e775547a9042382.html)\n\n**The PP-Vox Relationship Hits Breaking Point, Foreshadowing an Early 2026 Electoral Cycle**\nThe relationship between Spain's two main right-wing parties, the People's Party (PP) and Vox, has reached its lowest point in years, with deepening tensions threatening to end the current electoral cycle earlier than expected. The rift, which intensified in autumn 2025, stems from disagreements over coalition governance in Arag\u00f3n and Extremadura, where both parties failed to pass budgets due to open conflict. Vox\u2019s leader, Santiago Abascal, is reportedly considering blocking Javier Azc\u00f3n\u2019s candidacy for future investiture, citing betrayal over the dismissal of a racist and antisemitic Vox advisor. In Extremadura, regional PP leader Mar\u00eda Guardiola, initially critical of Vox, was forced into a coalition after the 2023 regional elections, but relations have deteriorated further. A major point of contention is the PP\u2019s shift on immigration policy under Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, whose recent Barcelona plan\u2014featuring point-based visas, deportation of criminal immigrants, stricter nationality rules, and cuts to the Ingreso M\u00ednimo Vital (IMV)\u2014is seen by Vox as copying their own platform. Meanwhile, Atenea, a new right-wing think tank led by Iv\u00e1n Espinosa de los Monteros, has gained tacit support from the PP and former Vox figures, provoking irony within Vox leadership. Tensions escalated in Congress when PP deputy Cayetana \u00c1lvarez de Toledo accused Minister F\u00e9lix Bola\u00f1os of \u2018feeding\u2019 Vox, implying a secret alliance between the PSOE and Vox, a claim denied but widely circulated. Despite public posturing\u2014Abascal praised Feij\u00f3o as 'a man with charm'\u2014private talks between the two leaders have been strained. The PP has intensified criticism of Vox\u2019s rhetoric, accusing it of portraying all immigrants as criminals, a stance echoed by PP spokesperson Alma Ezcurra. Within the right-wing sphere, calls for an end to hostilities are growing, but with both sides entrenched, the political waters remain turbulent, and a 2026 electoral cycle looms amid escalating divisions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20251025/relacion-pp-vox-entra-via-122987428)\n\n**Objective: Undermine Feij\u00f3o**\nThe article, published on October 18, 2025, by okdiario.com, argues that the central strategy of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) leadership in Ferraz and Moncloa is to undermine Pablo Casado's successor, Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the leader of the People's Party (PP), who came from Galicia to rescue the party from political decline amid ongoing crises. The author contends that without a credible national project to address Spain's deepening political and economic crisis, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez and his inner circle have no choice but to weaken Feij\u00f3o and provoke internal conflicts within the right-wing opposition. The piece criticizes regional PP leaders for personal ambition and lack of autonomy, driven by pressure from their inner circles, and dismisses claims by \u00cd\u00f1igo Errej\u00f3n (referred to as 'Rufi\u00e1n') that S\u00e1nchez could remain in power until 2050 under a weak PP. The author warns that if Feij\u00f3o were to fall during this period of instability, the deeply entrenched PSOE leadership would immediately call for new elections. Despite the PP's history of surviving extreme political challenges, the article notes that its current leadership lacks the will to engage in what it describes as a manipulated political dance orchestrated by S\u00e1nchez, Iv\u00e1n Redondo, and their team of advisors. The author implies that even capable PP figures exist who could lead the party in opposition, but they are unwilling to participate in a scenario where the center-right is used as a political pawn.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 03:46 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/opinion/objetivo-abatir-feijoo-15603216)\n\n**Feij\u00f3o's Leadership in the Fog: The PP's Struggle Against Vox and Internal Disarray**\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, president of the People's Party (PP), faces growing political challenges as his party's strategy unravels amid declining support and increasing competition from Vox. Despite initial optimism in the summer of 2024\u2014when the PP bet on judicial scandals involving key Socialist figures like Santos Cerd\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, and Koldo Garc\u00eda to weaken the PSOE\u2014these efforts have failed to deliver expected gains. The PSOE has stabilized in polls, with some surveys placing it as the leading or second force, even projecting a potential majority in future general elections if it reaches 32% support. Meanwhile, the PP has recorded its lowest approval ratings since Feij\u00f3o took office in April 2022, with Vox steadily siphoning off its voters\u201416% of former PP voters now support Vox, compared to only 2.9% of Vox voters switching back. This internal right-wing competition threatens the PP under Spain\u2019s electoral system, which penalizes third parties. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s inconsistent messaging\u2014evident in shifting positions on abortion and toughening rhetoric on migration, including a hardline plan unveiled in Barcelona\u2014signals internal disarray. His leadership is perceived as nervous and directionless, with the party\u2019s lack of clear strategy likened to driving without headlights in thick autumn fog. Critics, including Aznar via FAES, urge the PP to diversify its approach beyond judicial attacks and re-energize its base. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s inability to recoup lost ground or set a coherent course has intensified anxiety within the PP leadership.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 08:19 PM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/opinion/columnas/feijoo-antinieblas.html)\n\n**The PP\u2019s Internal Challenge: Why Its Greatest Threat Is Within**\nThe article analyzes the political challenges facing Spain's People's Party (PP) under leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, emphasizing that the party's greatest threat comes from within. Despite being the most voted party in the 2023 general election, the PP failed to form a government due to a lack of coalition partners, highlighting its dependence on internal cohesion. The piece argues that the PP is under intense pressure from both the left (PSOE) and the far-right (Vox), which benefit from escalating polarization. Vox seeks to position itself as the sole defender of a hardline stance against the PSOE, while PSOE attempts to discredit Feij\u00f3o by questioning his leadership and ability to contain Vox\u2019s influence. The article criticizes the PP for internal missteps: controversial remarks on abortion by regional leaders like Ayuso and Almeida, delayed and inconsistent positions on the Gaza conflict, and a late, fragmented response to immigration policy\u2014especially regarding the Canary Islands. It also highlights the ongoing political turmoil in the Valencian Community, where former leader Francisco Camps seeks a return to power amid a judicial investigation. The author stresses that the PP must maintain ideological coherence, avoid self-inflicted controversies, and implement its July 2023 political platform uniformly across Spain to prevent being undermined by its own errors. The central warning is clear: 'You cannot be your worst enemy.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 05:27 AM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/espana/librame-mis-amigos_2025101568ef30a9de40d8089e09d144.html)\n\n**The Autumn of the Eternal Candidate: Feij\u00f3o's Political Decline**\nThe article analyzes the declining political fortunes of Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the leader of Spain's People's Party (PP), describing his current situation as a 'political autumn' marked by a consistent drop in popularity since September 2025, with voters shifting support to the far-right party Vox. Despite the government coalition's economic success, internal contradictions\u2014such as failures in anti-violence wristbands, controversial labor reforms, defense spending disputes, and the resurgence of Podemos as a 'reverse Vox'\u2014are not the root cause of the PP's decline. Instead, the article attributes the crisis to Feij\u00f3o's own strategy of adopting Vox\u2019s ideologically extreme positions (anti-immigration racism, anti-abortion, anti-defense spending, and aggressive rhetoric) while lacking a coherent program. This approach is labeled as 'sterile' and driven by destructive propaganda rather than ideological seduction. The piece criticizes Feij\u00f3o\u2019s actions\u2014such as boycotting the King\u2019s judicial inauguration, attacking the Prime Minister personally, and using the Senate to amplify victimhood\u2014as evidence of 'antisanchismo' (anti-S\u00e1nchezism), which backfires by making the PP appear desperate and insecure. The article highlights internal fractures within the PP between hardliners and moderates over issues like the genocide debate and abortion access. Feij\u00f3o\u2019s indecision and ambivalence are portrayed as central flaws, exemplified by his hesitation to relocate to Madrid and his admission to Josep Piqu\u00e9: 'I don\u2019t have [board positions] guaranteeing my future, like you do.' The article concludes by likening Feij\u00f3o to Sisyphus\u2014perpetually failing to reach the summit\u2014citing his near-misses in the 2023 municipal elections and the 2025 general election as recurring failures.

The article asserts that Feij\u00f3o's leadership is marked by repeated errors and a deteriorating public image, undermining both his credibility and the PP's standing. His appointment of Miguel Tellado to his inner circle is criticized for its language, demeanor, and perceived ignorance, fueling internal dissent. Feij\u00f3o has lost the image of a moderate, liberal politician and is increasingly seen as a weak leader unable to control his party, as demonstrated by Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso's public defiance\u2014such as her illegal stance on abortion in Madrid, which forced Feij\u00f3o to publicly disavow the PP\u2019s position. His continued support for Carlos Maz\u00f3n despite his controversial conduct during the 2024 floods further damages his reputation, with 60% of PP voters believing he should have resigned. The article also criticizes Feij\u00f3o's lack of ideological depth and policy alternatives, reducing his opposition to personal attacks on Pedro S\u00e1nchez without offering a viable governance vision. This weakness has allowed the far-right party Vox to gain ground, with the PP increasingly adopting Vox\u2019s positions on issues such as Gaza, Catalan amnesty, immigration, climate change, and regional debt. The article concludes by stating that Feij\u00f3o's leadership is leading to a political downfall akin to Napoleon\u2019s Waterloo, signaling a decisive collapse in influence and credibility.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 04:34 PM\nSource:[galiciapress.es](https://www.galiciapress.es/articulo/opinion/2025-10-10/5461521-feijoo-camino-particular-waterloo)\n\n**PP's Narrow Margin for Error Amid Rising Vox Influence**\nThe People's Party (PP) in Spain is experiencing a decline in public approval, losing 0.6 points in one month and 1 point in two months, according to the Sigma Dos panel for EL MUNDO. Its voter loyalty has dropped by seven points over the past three months\u2014similar to the PSOE\u2019s decline\u2014while Vox is gaining over one million votes from the PP. The PP remains the most voted party, but its image as a competent governing party is eroding, and internal inconsistencies in messaging on sensitive issues like immigration and abortion undermine its ideological clarity. Regional PP governments faced major crises with poor coordination and communication from the central government, leading citizens to perceive institutional failure\u2014benefiting populist movements that thrive on distrust. Despite reservations, PP leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o continues to support Carlos Maz\u00f3n in the Valencian Community, weakening his credibility when demanding accountability. The party\u2019s failure to clearly communicate its reformist agenda after its July congress has left it ideologically ambiguous. The rise of right-wing extremism, exemplified by the UK\u2019s Conservative decline and Nigel Farage\u2019s success, presents a major challenge. The PP faces a unique dilemma: while the PSOE effectively isolates it politically by equating it with Vox, it simultaneously governs with the far left and ETA\u2019s heirs. This complex landscape demands that Feij\u00f3o deliver clear, consistent messages that uphold the PP\u2019s core values\u2014seriousness, responsibility, centrality, and regeneration\u2014to maintain its viability as an alternative to Pedro S\u00e1nchez.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 10:10 PM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/opinion/editorial/2025/10/06/68e2a309fdddff92398b457d.html)\n\n**Electoral State of Affairs: PP's Push for Early Elections Amid Rising Vox Support**\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, leader of the People's Party (PP), has repeatedly called for early elections since his party's narrow loss in the July 23 general election failed to prevent Pedro S\u00e1nchez from remaining Prime Minister. However, this repeated demand has lost political force and is no longer considered newsworthy. The PP continues to promote the perception of legislative instability by highlighting that the government has not presented its budget for the third consecutive year, faces consistent parliamentary defeats, and is affected by ongoing judicial cases involving S\u00e1nchez. Despite this, S\u00e1nchez insists on completing the full legislative term, positioning himself as the candidate for re-election in 2027, and asserting that opinion polls do not reflect the alleged collapse of the PSOE that the PP hopes for. Meanwhile, all polls agree on a continuous rise in support for Vox. This trend may explain the PP\u2019s strategic push for early elections, with regional leaders like Ma\u00f1ueco and Moreno suggesting they would align regional elections with national ones if S\u00e1nchez calls for early polls, and Guardiola warning in Extremadura that failure to pass budgets could lead to elections.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20251004/pp-elecciones-feijoo-inestabilidad-122212236)\n\n**Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o Acknowledges Need for Vox Support in Most 2026 Elections, Except in Andaluc\u00eda**\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, leader of Spain's People's Party (PP), has stated that he will not form a coalition with Vox in any future elections except in Andaluc\u00eda, where Juanma Moreno is expected to maintain a majority. This commitment, made during the PP's national congress in July 2024, was intended to distance the party from the political risks associated with Vox, particularly after the 2023 election, when fears of a Vox-led government under Abascal undermined Feij\u00f3o\u2019s chances of forming a government. However, G\u00e9nova (PP headquarters) clarifies that this is a personal pledge by Feij\u00f3o, and regional PP leaders are free to negotiate with Vox if they fail to achieve an absolute majority. Currently, only Andaluc\u00eda is seen as capable of a PP-only government. In Extremadura, President Mar\u00eda Guardiola has threatened to call early elections if Vox blocks the regional budget again, stating, 'I will not allow a blockade for this region.' In Arag\u00f3n, Jorge Azc\u00f3n faces a similar fiscal impasse and may also consider early elections, though he has not yet committed. Baleares also remains open to early polls due to ongoing tensions with Vox, especially amid a migration crisis. The PP is expected to improve its national standing, possibly increasing from 31 to 35 seats, but still falling short of the 41 needed for a majority. Vox is also projected to grow, with sources attributing this to public crises such as wildfires and the political instability of the PSOE. Despite the PSOE's weakened state due to judicial and political scandals involving its leader Miguel \u00c1ngel Gallardo and the brother of Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez, the PP still sees Vox as indispensable in most regions. In Castilla y Le\u00f3n, Alfonso Fern\u00e1ndez Ma\u00f1ueco will lead the first regional election of 2026, with polls suggesting he will need Vox\u2019s support to govern, even if not in a formal coalition. The PP aims to pressure Vox into backing the PP\u2019s investiture by framing a repeat election as Vox\u2019s fault. In all regions except Andaluc\u00eda, the PP is expected to rely on external support from Vox or other minor parties to pass budgets and legislation. The Cemop poll shows Vox gaining ground, even threatening to surpass the PSOE in Murcia. G\u00e9nova remains cautious, believing that 'useful voting' will prevail over emotional support for Vox, but acknowledges that the PP cannot fully break its dependence on Vox in most regions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 03:25 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2025-10-03/pp-asume-necesitara-vox-elecciones-2026-salvo-andalucia_4220860/)\n\n**Feij\u00f3o Admits to Considering Alliance with Vox if PP Fails to Secure Majority**\nAlberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o, the president of the PP, has admitted that his party would consider forming an alliance with Vox if they fail to secure a majority in the upcoming general elections. In an interview with 'El Mundo', Feij\u00f3o stated that his goal is to form a single-party government, with all ministers being from the PP. He also criticized the current government's agreement on special financing for Catalonia, calling it 'absolutely illegal' and vowing to fight for equal public services across Spain. Feij\u00f3o said, 'If tomorrow there were elections, I'm convinced that the PP would win a majority. [...] If we don't achieve that majority because we're short of a few seats, then I'll have to make deals with Vox.' He also expressed his commitment to not forming a coalition government with Vox, stating, 'My commitment is to get 10 million votes and I believe it's feasible.' Feij\u00f3o also emphasized that the key to determining whether the current legislature will last until 2027 lies with the investigations of the Guardia Civil, rather than the current government or its allies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 13, 2025 07:30 AM\nSource:[LaSexta](https://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/feijoo-reconoce-que-pactaria-vox-logra-mayoria-absoluta-proximas-elecciones_20250713687360796e1ec26d312b58ac.html)\n\n",

Nearly all experts note a serious internal crisis\u2014particularly centered on the Maz\u00f3n/Valencia scandal, open regional factionalism (notably from Ayuso), and negative media coverage\u2014as unprecedented threats to Feij\u00f3o's authority. The most salient risk factors cited are internal party dissent, declining poll numbers, the rise of Vox, public perception of weak leadership, and potential crisis escalation or further scandal. However, several stabilizing factors are also highlighted: the extremely short window remaining to resolution (less than two months as of early November 2025), the inertia and institutional friction of the PP's leadership removal processes, lack of a unified challenger, and the party's traditional risk aversion to abrupt transitions\u2014especially absent a catastrophic event or direct personal scandal implicating Feij\u00f3o. While the risk of a forced exit before year-end has risen notably, especially if the Maz\u00f3n crisis escalates or regional barons coordinate a challenge, most analysts agree that the base rate for such late-year opposition leader removals in Spain is low. The consensus scenario is that Feij\u00f3o, though weakened, is likely to survive the current storm at least through December 2025, with his fate to be more seriously contested in the following year's electoral cycle.
