Given Meta's historic pattern of celebrating user milestones and the strong likelihood that the crossover point has already occurred (or will imminently), combined with supportive ecosystem effects and the public relations value of this victory over a high-profile rival, the probability is high.

If these trends continue, Threads should overtake X in MAUs by Q4 2025. Moreover, multiple articles from September-November 2025 indicate that Threads has already overtaken X in daily active users (DAUs) on mobile globally, a strong leading indicator of imminent MAU crossover. The main uncertainty lies in the public reporting of MAUs and the credibility of X's reported or estimated user counts. Given Meta's track record and recent PR wins, it is likely Meta will publicize the milestone if/when it occurs. The base rate for a challenger overtaking an incumbent is low, but the incumbent's accelerated decline and the challenger\u2019s unique integration with a massive, active user base dramatically raise the odds in this case.

Conversely, the risk that Meta withholds a definitive MAU statement is not just a technicality; it's a real tail risk, as Meta has sometimes been selective in milestone announcements when competitive advantage is not overwhelming. This risk should temper the extremeness of your probability even further, as the question hinges not on underlying user numbers alone, but on the explicitness and timing of Meta's public reporting. Thus, your probability might be slightly too high given the dual requirements of user lead and unambiguous public disclosure."

Judge Boasberg noted that the 'river' of social networking has fundamentally changed since the 2020 lawsuit was filed, with new competitors like TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and Apple\u2019s messaging services now playing central roles. Meta\u2019s spokesperson, via Andy Stone on X, stated, 'The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition. Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth.' The FTC had argued that Meta\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) were strategic moves to eliminate competition, citing internal emails showing CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 'better to buy than compete' philosophy. Meta countered that both platforms were small at the time and that the acquisitions helped scale them into global services. Zuckerberg testified that the early emails reflected exploratory thinking, not a plan to suppress rivals. The ruling marks a significant setback for the FTC, which recently won major antitrust cases against Google. While the FTC may appeal, Meta\u2019s leadership emphasized its focus on innovation and competition in a dynamic digital marketplace.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/meta-facebook-instagram-ftc-antitrust-case-win-zuckerberg-11068803)\n\n**Meta's VibesAIfeed Gains Traction with Two Million Daily Users**\nMeta Platforms Inc (META) has announced that its new feature, VibesAIfeed, has reached approximately 2 million daily active users since its launch in early November 2025, with a consistent weekly growth rate of 1%. Despite this progress, VibesAIfeed remains significantly smaller than Meta's Threads app, which has 150 million daily active users. Meta, the world's largest social media company, operates a 'Family of Apps' including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, collectively serving nearly 4 billion monthly active users. The company's business model relies on user data to deliver targeted advertising. Financially, Meta demonstrates strong performance with a trailing twelve months (TTM) revenue of $189.46 billion, a 3-year revenue growth rate of 15.1%, an operating margin of 43.23%, a net margin of 30.89%, and an EBITDA margin of 54.24%. Its balance sheet is robust, with an Altman Z-Score of 10.55, indicating strong financial health. However, recent insider activity shows 27 selling transactions and no insider buying over the past three months, totaling 13,960 shares sold. Valuation metrics suggest a modestly undervalued position, with a P/E ratio of 26.44, a P/S ratio of 8.17 (near its 1-year low), and a P/B ratio of 7.78. Analysts maintain a 'Buy' consensus with a target price of $843.56 and a recommendation score of 1.8. Technical indicators, including an RSI of 25.52, suggest the stock may be oversold. Meta operates in the Communication Services sector within the Interactive Media industry and has a market capitalization of approximately $1.51 trillion.

The FTC had argued that Meta violated antitrust laws by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp to eliminate competition. The judge concluded that platforms like TikTok and YouTube serve as effective competitors, preventing Meta from monopolizing the market. He also noted that the social media landscape has evolved significantly since the lawsuit was filed, particularly due to the rise of AI-generated content, which weakened the FTC\u2019s case. The ruling is a major victory for Meta, which relies heavily on Instagram for ad revenue and WhatsApp for international reach and business subscriptions. Although Meta has 3.3 billion daily users, CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified during the seven-week trial that Facebook\u2019s popularity is declining.

During a seven-week trial, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified that platforms like YouTube and TikTok provide strong competition. Judge Boasberg agreed, stating that TikTok and YouTube prevent Meta from monopolizing the market, and noted that Meta\u2019s share of time spent on social media platforms is modest and declining. He emphasized that even if YouTube were excluded from the market, Meta would still not hold a monopoly. The judge also highlighted that the social media landscape has evolved significantly since the FTC filed its case, particularly due to the rise of AI-generated content, which weakened the agency\u2019s original arguments.

The decision is a significant win for Silicon Valley, as other tech giants like Google, Apple, and Amazon face ongoing antitrust litigation. Meta acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.

The case, originally filed five years ago, centered on Meta\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. Judge Boasberg ruled that the FTC must demonstrate Meta currently holds monopoly power, not just past dominance, and concluded it failed to do so. In 2021, Boasberg had initially dismissed the case for insufficient evidence of Facebook\u2019s market power; the FTC later filed an amended complaint with additional data on user numbers and competitive metrics. In 2022, he allowed the case to proceed due to the enhanced detail. Key Meta figures\u2014including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, former COO Sheryl Sandberg, Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom, and other current and former executives\u2014testified during the trial, which began in April 2025. The FTC had argued that the acquisitions should have been blocked and demanded the divestiture of Instagram and WhatsApp, claiming no viable alternatives exist to Facebook and Instagram for social communication. However, Judge Boasberg emphasized that the FTC must prove current anticompetitive behavior, not past actions, noting that social media\u2019s core use and content formats have changed significantly since Meta\u2019s early days. He found that TikTok and YouTube are now seen as genuine substitutes for Meta\u2019s platforms, with strong economic competition evidenced by user migration, Meta\u2019s massive investments to remain competitive, and internal industry documents identifying Meta as a key rival. Boasberg concluded: 'Meta is not an unchallenged monopolist,' and the evidence supporting Meta\u2019s competitive position was 'credible and persuasive.' This ruling follows a similar outcome in October 2025, when Google avoided forced divestiture despite being found to have monopolized the search market, though it was ordered to loosen control over search data.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 19, 2025 01:12 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/world/2025-11-19/doc-infxweku2393072.shtml)\n\n**US: Meta wins huge antitrust case, avoids break-up**\nOn November 18, 2025, US District Judge James Boasberg ruled in favor of Meta in a landmark antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2020, preventing the company from being forced to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC had alleged that Meta acquired these platforms to eliminate competition, citing Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 2008 maxim, 'It's better to buy than compete.' Judge Boasberg concluded that the FTC failed to prove Meta currently holds monopoly power, stating that the market landscape has changed significantly: 'the wall' between social networking and social media has broken down. He emphasized that Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube now offer nearly identical features, particularly short-form video content via Reels, with only 7% of Instagram users now engaging primarily with friends' content. The court rejected the FTC\u2019s argument that 'connecting friends and family' constituted a distinct market separate from video entertainment platforms. Meta welcomed the ruling, with its chief legal officer stating that the company's products drive American innovation and economic growth. CEO Zuckerberg had previously sought intervention from former President Donald Trump, who, after returning to office, has supported major tech firms, while Zuckerberg and other tech leaders have made substantial donations to Trump\u2019s campaigns.

The FTC had argued these acquisitions were designed to reduce competition and maintain a near-monopoly in the personal social networking market. However, Judge Boasberg rejected the FTC\u2019s argument, stating that 'even if Meta benefited from monopoly in the past, the FTC must prove that this dominance continues\u2014and the agency failed to do so.' The decision represents a major legal victory for Meta. In a statement on X, Meta emphasized that the ruling recognizes the intense competition it faces, highlighting that its products deliver value to individuals and businesses and exemplify American innovation. During the trial, which took place in April and May 2025, FTC attorneys claimed Meta maintained a monopoly over 'personal social networking' by controlling users\u2019 relationships with family and friends, with Snapchat being the only real competitor. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta\u2019s founder and CEO, and former Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg testified. FTC lawyers cited numerous reports of user dissatisfaction, particularly regarding the increasing number of ads, which continue to generate billions in profits. Meta countered that its main competitors are YouTube and TikTok, which operate in a broader, rapidly evolving global market and compete fiercely for user attention.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 09:13 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9/20251118-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B6-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A6-%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%87%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%87%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%86)\n\n**Meta reacts to historic FTC antitrust case victory**\nMeta celebrated a major legal victory over the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) on November 18, 2025, after U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected the FTC\u2019s attempt to force Meta to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. The court ruled that the FTC failed to prove Meta retains monopoly power in social networking, citing the rapidly evolving digital landscape. Judge Boasberg noted that the 'river' of social networking has fundamentally changed since the 2020 lawsuit was filed, with new competitors like TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and Apple\u2019s messaging services now playing central roles. Meta\u2019s spokesperson, via Andy Stone on X, stated, 'The Court's decision today recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition. Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth.' The FTC had argued that Meta\u2019s acquisitions of Instagram (2012) and WhatsApp (2014) were strategic moves to eliminate competition, citing internal emails showing CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s 'better to buy than compete' philosophy. Meta countered that both platforms were small at the time and that the acquisitions helped scale them into global services. Zuckerberg testified that the early emails reflected exploratory thinking, not a plan to suppress rivals. The ruling marks a significant setback for the FTC, which recently won major antitrust cases against Google. While the FTC may appeal, Meta\u2019s leadership emphasized its focus on innovation and competition in a dynamic digital marketplace.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/meta-facebook-instagram-ftc-antitrust-case-win-zuckerberg-11068803)\n\n**Meta has won the antitrust case that could have forced it to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp**\nMeta has won a landmark antitrust case brought by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), avoiding a potential mandate to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. US District Judge James Boasberg ruled on November 18, 2025, that the FTC failed to prove Meta currently holds monopoly power in the social media market. The FTC had argued in 2020\u2014during President Donald Trump's first term\u2014that Meta's acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp stifled competition. Meta countered that its investments enabled those platforms to grow to over 1 billion users and pointed to TikTok\u2019s rise as evidence of ongoing competitive pressure. Judge Boasberg emphasized that while Meta may have had monopoly power in the past, the FTC did not demonstrate it still holds such power today. He specifically noted that TikTok and YouTube are now dominant competitors, with TikTok alone being sufficient to undermine the FTC\u2019s claim. The judge concluded that 'even if YouTube is out, including TikTok alone defeats the FTC's case.' The FTC may appeal, but it has not yet indicated plans to do so. High-profile executives, including Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Adam Mosseri, and Kevin Systrom, testified during the trial. Zuckerberg stated that Meta\u2019s growth had 'slowed down dramatically' due to TikTok\u2019s popularity.

According to Fast Company, this growth indicates a strong consolidation of Threads as a direct competitor to X, Elon Musk's social platform, which is focusing on its AI-powered chatbot Grok. While X is estimated to have around 550 million active monthly users as of March 2024, Threads is rapidly closing the gap, especially in terms of daily active mobile users, as shown by Similarweb's public data. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has stated that his goal is to reach 1 billion active monthly users on Threads, and the platform is implementing new features, such as direct messages, real-time news and trending topics, to achieve this target. The rapid growth of Threads confirms the increasing interest of users in alternative and innovative social networks, especially those integrated with AI and real-time content.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 10:04 AM\nSource:[Leggo online](https://www.leggo.it/tecnologia/news/threads_supera_400_milioni_record_sfida_x_oggi_13_8_2025-9011104.html)\n\n**Threads Surpasses 4 Billion MAU, Approaching X's Daily Mobile App Usage**\nMeta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) Threads has surpassed 4 billion monthly active users (MAU) in just two years since its launch as a competitor to social media X. Instagram's Adam Mosseri announced this on Tuesday (12th). Following this news, Meta's stock price has broken through its 52-week high of $784.75. According to data from TechCrunch, Threads added 50 million monthly users in the last quarter, bringing its total to 3.5 billion MAU, as reported by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April. X still leads with over 6 billion MAU, according to former CEO Linda Yaccarino's past statement. However, Similarweb data shows that Threads is approaching X's daily mobile app usage. Meta launched Threads in 2023 as a potential 'X killer' to attract users from Elon Musk's platform. As of June 2025, Threads has 111.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android, a 127.8% increase from the same period last year. In contrast, X has 13.2 million daily active users, a 15.2% decrease from the same period last year. On the web, X still dominates with an average daily global visitor count of 144.8 million in June, compared to Threads' 6.9 million. Threads' growth is attributed to the wave of new features introduced over the past year, including DM, Pedibers integration, customized feeds, and AI tools. Meta's stock price has risen 31.83% so far this year. Wall Street analysts have revised their price targets and reaffirmed their buy ratings based on Meta's strong 2Q 2025 earnings and optimistic 3Q outlook. Analysts from Rosenblatt, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Cantor Fitzgerald, Wedbush, and KeyBanc highlighted accelerated ad revenue, increased engagement, and rapid progress in AI-driven monetization as key positives. They noted that Meta's massive AI investment, including increased capital expenditures on data centers, infrastructure, and product development, is already driving stronger ad conversion rates, deeper user engagement, and new revenue streams. They pointed out that Meta is leading in AI, expanding monetization across the platform, and maintaining double-digit growth despite increasing costs. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 09:31 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/47080018/mau-4)\n\n**Thread Surpasses 400 Million Monthly Active Users, Closes Gap with X**\nMeta's social media platform 'Thread' has surpassed 400 million monthly active users (MAU) in just two years since its launch, rapidly closing the gap with its competitor X (formerly Twitter). According to reports from TechCrunch and other foreign media outlets, Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, said that as of a few weeks ago, the number of people using Thread every month had exceeded 400 million. Thread was launched in July 2023 as a rival to X. It took two years for the platform to reach 400 million monthly users. The recent surge is significant. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, announced in April that Thread had reached 350 million monthly active users, and in just one quarter, the number increased by 50 million. Mosseri said, 'We started with the absurd idea of competing with Twitter, but now Thread has become a meaningful platform where people can freely exchange different perspectives.' He expressed gratitude to everyone who has contributed to creating today's Thread and said, 'There is still much to be done, and I expect further development.' Thread is rapidly closing the gap with X. According to SimilerWeb, a market research firm, as of June, Thread's daily active users on iPhone and Android mobile apps reached 111.5 million, a 127.8% increase from the previous year, while X had 132 million daily active users, a 15.2% decrease from the previous year. This is the result of various new features released in the past year, including direct messages, Fediverse integration, customized feeds, and AI feature enhancements. However, in terms of web access, X still leads the way. In June, X's average global web visitors reached 145.8 million per day, while Thread had only 6.9 million.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 06:27 AM\nSource:[\uae30\uc220\ub85c \uc138\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc14\uafb8\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc758 \ub180\uc774\ud130](https://it.chosun.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2023092145730)\n\n**Threads Surpasses 4 Billion Monthly Active Users, Closing in on X**\nMeta's social media platform Threads has surpassed 4 billion monthly active users (MAU) in just two years since its launch, closing in on Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). Adam Mosseri, CEO of Instagram, announced on August 12 that Threads has reached 4 billion MAU, a significant milestone. Mosseri said, 'We started with a crazy idea to compete with Twitter, but now Threads has evolved into a platform where people can freely share their perspectives.' Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, previously announced in April that Threads had reached 350 million MAU, a 500 million user increase in just one quarter. Threads is rapidly catching up to X, with Musk stating that X has around 6 billion MAU. According to Similerweb, a market research firm, Threads' mobile daily active users are also approaching X's numbers, with 111.5 million daily active users on iOS and Android devices in June, a 127.8% increase from the previous year. In contrast, X had 132 million daily active users in June, a 15.2% decrease from the previous year. However, X still leads in web traffic, with an average of 145.8 million daily visitors in June, compared to Threads' 690,000 daily visitors. Threads has been attracting users with new features such as direct messages, federated social networking, customized feeds, and AI enhancements. In Korea, Threads is growing rapidly among 20-30-year-olds, with a domestic MAU of 5.43 million in July, a 240 million increase from the previous year. An IT industry insider said, 'Threads, a text-based SNS like X, has naturally become a platform for informal communication, and is gaining popularity among young people.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: August 13, 2025 12:47 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2025/08/13/BSZCAFULX5G2VPONJIWDEMAPIU/)\n\n",
    "date": "2025-11-20T01:12:33.720732",
    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, forecasters converge on a high likelihood that Threads will publicly report more monthly active users (MAUs) than Twitter (now X) before the end of 2025. The consensus is driven by several reinforcing trends: Threads' rapid MAU growth (surpassing 400 million by August 2025), the strong integration and network effects of Instagram (over 3 billion MAUs), and X's continued decline in both DAUs and MAUs, exacerbated by brand instability, negative press, and weak monetization. Experts highlight that Meta has a historical pattern of announcing such milestones, especially given the competitive context against X. Although most agree the base rate for social platforms overtaking entrenched incumbents is low, the circumstances are unique: Threads has capitalized on a seamless onboarding process and X's missteps. The only meaningful risk to a YES resolution identified is the requirement for an explicit, public MAU announcement from Meta that clearly exceeds the best available public estimate for X\u2014if Meta does not report, or if X's figures are ambiguous or suddenly revised upward, the resolution could be uncertain. Nonetheless, the increasing convergence in daily and monthly active user metrics, combined with Meta's incentive to publicize a competitive victory, leads to a cluster of probabilities in the 85\u201393% range for a YES outcome. Divergences in forecast probability are mainly due to uncertainties in public reporting and the possible ambiguity in third-party data, but the overall expert consensus is that a YES resolution is highly likely.",
