The government shutdown and unresolved funding fight further compress the legislative calendar and heighten partisan acrimony. Democratic opposition is hardened by recent electoral wins and the salience of health care as a winning issue. While reconciliation offers a narrow procedural path, it is limited in scope and requires near-perfect GOP unity, which recent news (e.g., some Republicans supporting ACA subsidies, Speaker Johnson\u2019s admission that repeal is infeasible) suggests is lacking.

GOP leaders themselves admit that full repeal is increasingly unrealistic, and intraparty divisions persist. The expiration of enhanced subsidies is a flashpoint, but resolving it does not itself satisfy the question\u2019s criteria; more fundamental statutory rollbacks face steeper resistance. The base rate for successful, large-scale entitlement retrenchment in U.S. history is low, especially when benefits are broadly diffused. The most likely outcome is some administrative and budgetary skirmishing, with possible incremental changes, but not the wholesale curtailment of three or more major ACA pillars. Only a narrow window (post-shutdown, before 2026 midterms) exists for rapid action, and even then, GOP unity is not assured.

Furthermore, the window for legislative action is extremely narrow, and the specific requirement that three or more major components be curtailed makes this a substantially higher bar than mere incremental or symbolic change. Given evidence from recent news (deadlock, divided GOP, emboldened Democrats) and the pattern of status quo resilience in entitlement politics, a probability approaching one-in-four seems unsupported.

Furthermore, the base rate for repealing or significantly curtailing three or more major social program components in the U.S. is extremely low, even during rare windows. The forecast could strengthen its case by more deeply weighing the negative feedback from the 2017 failure, the rapid mobilization of ACA beneficiaries and stakeholders, and the short legislative timeframe before the midterms.

The main divergence centers on how much weight to assign to the narrow legislative window and the possibility of a sudden partisan push using reconciliation. The critiques of higher probabilities reinforce that the required threshold (three components) and the short timeline are substantial barriers, while defenses of slightly higher probabilities (around 20%) reasonably allow for low-probability tail risk. No new information from deliberation suggests the risk is higher than initially estimated; if anything, group consensus and further analysis of legislative and political constraints support a slightly lower probability.

My initial figure (22%) was influenced by the theoretical possibility of a late reconciliation push, but given the demanding resolution criteria (three or more components), the current legislative environment, and the consensus around the stickiness of the status quo, a revised probability in the low teens is warranted to reflect both tail risks and prevailing constraints.",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nThe[ <u>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act) (PPACA), signed into law in the US in 2010 and commonly known as the ACA (or as Obamacare), has been subject to a[ <u>number of attempts by Republicans to repeal it</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efforts_to_repeal_the_Affordable_Care_Act). While attempts at repeal were ultimately unsuccessful, the law has been subject to[ <u>a number of limitations and changes</u>](https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-the-affordable-care-act/?entry=table-of-contents-how-has-the-aca-changed-since-it-was-first-passed) imposed by subsequent court rulings and laws.\n\nFollowing President-elect Donald Trump's election victory in November 2024 along with Republican control of Congress, there has been a great deal of[ <u>speculation</u>](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/what-would-trump-do-with-the-aca-its-hard-to-tell-for-sure/) regarding the future of the ACA. In his first term Trump was[ <u>critical of the ACA</u>](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/918797009133465600) and[ <u>advocated</u>](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-signing-executive-order-promoting-healthcare-choice-competition/#:~:text=And%20we%E2%80%99re%20going%20to%20also%20pressure%20Congress%20very%20strongly%20to%20finish%20the%20repeal%20and%20the%20replace%20of%20Obamacare%20once%20and%20for%20all.%20We%20will%20have%20great%20healthcare%20in%20our%20country.) for it to be repealed and replaced. More recently on the campaign trail Trump has continued to[ <u>criticize the ACA</u>](https://x.com/TrumpDailyPosts/status/1728511466037485668), but has somewhat softened his stance by saying \"[<u>I'm not running to terminate the ACA. . .</u>](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112163485572377413)\" and instead focusing on reforms to improve the program and cut costs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has also[ <u>recently called for reforms to the ACA</u>](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/speaker-johnson-criticizes-obamacare-promises-massive-reform-trump-win-rcna177853).\n\nA number of Republican reforms to the ACA have been proposed in recent years following attempts at larger repeal, most of which have abandoned full repeal and instead aim to implement a range of reforms. Some of the published proposals are:\n\n* [<u>Proposals from chapter 14 about the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)</u>](https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_CHAPTER-14.pdf) from the[ <u>Project 2025 Policy Agenda</u>](https://www.project2025.org/policy/)\n* The Republican Study Committee's[ <u>FY 2025 Budget Proposal</u>](https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87)\n* A[ <u>2023 opinion piece</u>](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/4-ways-repeal-obamacare) by former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal\n* A[ <u>paper from the Paragon Health Institute</u>](https://paragoninstitute.org/private-health/the-great-obamacare-enrollment-fraud/), a health policy research institute run by[ <u>Brian Blase</u>](https://paragoninstitute.org/profile/brian-blase/), former economic policy advisor during Trump's first term\n\nThe ACA is lengthy and complex, but the Republican proposals generally focus on a few key aspects, described below alongside other potential targets:\n\n* **Reducing Medicaid eligibility and expenses:** The ACA expanded federal Medicaid eligibility to households with income of 133% of the federal poverty line or less ([<u>see ACA Section 2001</u>](https://www.congress.gov/111/plaws/publ148/PLAW-111publ148.pdf), effectively this threshold is [<u>138%</u>](https://www.healthcare.gov/medicaid-chip/medicaid-expansion-and-you/) after accounting for other income adjustments in the law). However, Medicaid is administered through the states with some funding supplied by the federal government. The ACA was structured to tie federal funding to this expansion, but in [*<u>NFIB v. Sebelius</u>*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius) the Supreme Court decided that the law amounted to an invalid coercion of states and therefore the Medicaid expansion must be voluntary. Republican proposals to change this tend to view the federal Medicaid spending as excessive and wasteful, and argue for limitations on eligibility, such as via work requirements, more flexibility for states to determine eligibility, and changes to federal funding that reduce federal spending.\n* **Limiting premium tax credits:** The ACA implemented tax credits for households with earnings from 100% to 400% of the federal poverty line to offset costs for qualified healthcare plans. Republican plans have proposed narrowing eligibility, reducing subsidy amounts, or allowing subsidies to be redirected to health savings accounts (HSAs) or insurance plans that do not comply with ACA requirements.\n* **Fully eliminating the individual mandate:** The ACA mandated that individuals must have health insurance, and imposed a penalty for those without insurance. The [<u>2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act set that penalty to zero</u>](https://www.healthinsurance.org/glossary/individual-mandate/), effectively reducing the legal force behind the mandate. However, the mandate itself is still law, despite there being no penalty associated with it.\n* **Limiting the employer mandate:** The ACA [<u>mandated that employers of certain sizes must offer health insurance coverage to their employees</u>](https://www.cigna.com/employers/insights/informed-on-reform/employer-mandate), and imposed penalties for non-compliance. This mandate is still in effect.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on subsidies and plan eligibility:** The premium tax credits and other subsidies under the ACA are generally only eligible for healthcare plans that satisfy certain criteria set forth in the ACA. Republicans [<u>have proposed</u>](https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/11/21/nx-s1-5198483/trump-republicans-obamacare-aca-medicaid) allowing the use of subsidies for plans that do not comply with the ACA, or for contributions to Health Savings Accounts.\n* **Eliminating restrictions on medical underwriting:** [<u>Medical underwriting</u>](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/medical-underwriting.asp) is the practice of insurers determining health plan eligibility and pricing based on the health characteristics of individuals or groups. The ACA prohibited medical underwriting in most cases for health insurance with the exception of [<u>consideration</u>](https://www.healthcare.gov/how-plans-set-your-premiums/) of age, location, tobacco use, family status, and plan category. It also prohibited denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions. The [<u>Republican Study Committee</u>](https://hern.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_budget_including_letter_web_version.pdf#page=87) proposal would expand the ability of insurers to use medical underwriting, arguing that the current limitations cause younger, healthier individuals to face larger health insurance expenses.\n\nWhile Republicans do not have a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, they could pursue significant changes through budget reconciliation, a legislative process requiring only a simple majority in the Senate. Reconciliation was previously used in 2017 to attempt to repeal parts of the ACA, including Medicaid expansion and premium subsidies, but the effort ultimately [<u>failed by a narrow margin</u>](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/27/539907467/senate-careens-toward-high-drama-midnight-health-care-vote). Generally only [<u>changes to law that impact certain classifications of federal spending</u>](https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation) can be accomplished with reconciliation, and [<u>typically</u>](https://www.pgpf.org/article/what-is-budget-reconciliation/) only once per year.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

Trump labeled Pelosi as 'evil, corrupt,' and claimed she was 'rapidly losing control of her party' and would not return. He expressed pride in being impeached twice by her, stating the attempts 'failed miserably.' Pelosi, 85, served nearly 40 years representing San Francisco and was the first woman to serve as U.S. House Speaker. During her two non-consecutive terms (2007\u20132011 and 2019\u20132023), she championed major legislation including the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank financial reforms, and the repeal of Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. She also led the January 6 committee that produced a 1,000-page report on the Capitol attack, in contrast to most Republicans who refused to investigate. After Democrats lost the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi announced she would not seek re-election or another leadership role. Potential successors include left-wing challenger Saikat Chakrabarti and California State Senator Scott Wiener, who is considering a run ahead of the 2026 midterms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 05:32 PM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/a-great-thing-for-america-donald-trump-reacts-to-nancy-pelosis-retirement-10350272/)\n\n**The GOP is 'not even pretending' to care about healthcare: analysis**\nAccording to reporter Merrill Goozner, the Republican Party (GOP) has abandoned its past efforts toward universal healthcare coverage, with the current trajectory under President Trump and a compliant Republican Congress effectively reversing decades of progress. Historically, Republicans supported incremental steps toward universal coverage, including President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1970s proposal for industry-managed insurance, a 1990s Republican-led authorization for children\u2019s coverage, and Trump\u2019s 2017 pledge to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with a plan offering 'insurance for everyone.' However, Goozner states that the GOP is now 'not even pretending' to care about universal coverage. Trump\u2019s 2025 budget proposal is projected to remove 17 million people from insurance rolls by 2034, with over two-thirds of those losses due to Medicaid cuts. These cuts include bureaucratic barriers such as twice-annual recertification, which states have already been authorized to enforce, despite being postponed until after the 2026 mid-term elections to obscure their impact. Low-wage workers are expected to lose Medicaid coverage not due to lack of employment but due to burdensome paperwork. Meanwhile, premiums for individual health plans on the ACA exchanges are rising sharply due to the expiration of enhanced subsidies. Employer-sponsored insurance costs are increasing at twice the rate of inflation. Goozner warns that regardless of the outcome of government shutdown negotiations, the healthcare affordability crisis\u2014worsened by the GOP\u2019s reversal on universal coverage\u2014will remain a central issue in the 2026 congressional elections, with the key question being whether Democrats can capitalize on voter concern by proposing a viable alternative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/republicans-healthcare-shutdown/)\n\n**Hard-line Democrats lean in to ObamaCare fight after Tuesday sweep**\nFollowing their strong performance in the November 5, 2025, elections, Democrats are doubling down on health care as a central issue for the 2026 midterms, citing the results as a referendum on Republicans' stance on affordability. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stated that Democrats' success stemmed from their commitment to protecting health care, while Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) warned that conceding on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) after such a victory would undermine the party\u2019s message. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) emphasized that Democrats won because they stood for affordable health care, contrasting it with Republican opposition. The shutdown has driven up health care premiums by an average of 114% due to the loss of enhanced ACA subsidies, according to KFF, and millions of low-income Americans face cuts to SNAP benefits. Democrats, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), argue that the election results have shifted the political calculus, making compromise less appealing. Brad Woodhouse of Protect Our Care urged Democrats not to accept a deal without a permanent extension of tax credits, noting Republicans extended tax cuts for the wealthy during reconciliation.

The enrollment period ran from November 1 to January 31, 2017, and data from the federal website showed relatively stable enrollment through most of the year, followed by a drop-off near the end. The report covers 39 states using the federal marketplace; 11 states, including California and New York, operate their own exchanges and were not included. The Trump administration did not release nationwide enrollment figures, stating it would provide more data in March.

Trump stated his plan would include 'insurance for everybody,' rejecting the notion that those unable to pay should be denied care. While 'insurance for everybody' is a long-standing goal of health policy experts, government-provided insurance has lacked political support, and market-based solutions have faced challenges. Republicans had vowed to repeal the ACA for nearly seven years. The House and Senate had recently passed a budget resolution enabling the repeal of major ACA provisions without a Democratic filibuster, allowing committees in both chambers to draft the details of repeal and replacement. Trump also pledged to force drug manufacturers to negotiate lower prices with Medicaid and Medicare, asserting they would no longer be 'politically protected,' a promise he had made during his campaign.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2017 06:59 PM\nSource:[thecerbatgem.com](https://www.thecerbatgem.com/2017/01/16/president-elects-plan-for-health-insurance-light-on-details.html)\n\n**'A great thing for America': Donald Trump reacts to Nancy Pelosi's retirement**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump reacted to Nancy Pelosi's announcement of her retirement from Congress on November 6, 2025, calling it 'a great thing for America.' Trump labeled Pelosi as 'evil, corrupt,' and claimed she was 'rapidly losing control of her party' and would not return. He expressed pride in being impeached twice by her, stating the attempts 'failed miserably.' Pelosi, 85, served nearly 40 years representing San Francisco and was the first woman to serve as U.S. House Speaker. During her two non-consecutive terms (2007\u20132011 and 2019\u20132023), she championed major legislation including the Affordable Care Act, Dodd-Frank financial reforms, and the repeal of Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. She also led the January 6 committee that produced a 1,000-page report on the Capitol attack, in contrast to most Republicans who refused to investigate. After Democrats lost the House in the 2022 midterms, Pelosi announced she would not seek re-election or another leadership role.

Historically, Republicans supported incremental steps toward universal coverage, including President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1970s proposal for industry-managed insurance, a 1990s Republican-led authorization for children\u2019s coverage, and Trump\u2019s 2017 pledge to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA) with a plan offering 'insurance for everyone.' However, Goozner states that the GOP is now 'not even pretending' to care about universal coverage. Trump\u2019s 2025 budget proposal is projected to remove 17 million people from insurance rolls by 2034, with over two-thirds of those losses due to Medicaid cuts. These cuts include bureaucratic barriers such as twice-annual recertification, which states have already been authorized to enforce, despite being postponed until after the 2026 mid-term elections to obscure their impact. Low-wage workers are expected to lose Medicaid coverage not due to lack of employment but due to burdensome paperwork. Meanwhile, premiums for individual health plans on the ACA exchanges are rising sharply due to the expiration of enhanced subsidies. Employer-sponsored insurance costs are increasing at twice the rate of inflation. Goozner warns that regardless of the outcome of government shutdown negotiations, the healthcare affordability crisis\u2014worsened by the GOP\u2019s reversal on universal coverage\u2014will remain a central issue in the 2026 congressional elections, with the key question being whether Democrats can capitalize on voter concern by proposing a viable alternative.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/republicans-healthcare-shutdown/)\n\n**Hard-line Democrats lean in to ObamaCare fight after Tuesday sweep**\nFollowing their strong performance in the November 5, 2025, elections, Democrats are doubling down on health care as a central issue for the 2026 midterms, citing the results as a referendum on Republicans' stance on affordability. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stated that Democrats' success stemmed from their commitment to protecting health care, while Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) warned that conceding on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) after such a victory would undermine the party\u2019s message. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) emphasized that Democrats won because they stood for affordable health care, contrasting it with Republican opposition. The shutdown has driven up health care premiums by an average of 114% due to the loss of enhanced ACA subsidies, according to KFF, and millions of low-income Americans face cuts to SNAP benefits. Democrats, including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), argue that the election results have shifted the political calculus, making compromise less appealing. Brad Woodhouse of Protect Our Care urged Democrats not to accept a deal without a permanent extension of tax credits, noting Republicans extended tax cuts for the wealthy during reconciliation. A Democratic strategist noted that a vote on ACA without a pre-negotiated deal risks giving vulnerable Republicans political cover while Democrats lose a policy win. Sen.

Despite over a decade of rhetoric, Republicans have failed to present a coherent alternative, while the ACA has significantly reduced the uninsured rate from 45 million to 25 million, protected individuals with preexisting conditions, and expanded Medicaid and subsidies. The article notes that over 80% of ACA enrollees report satisfaction, and enrollment has reached record highs under President Biden\u2019s expanded subsidies. Crucially, ACA beneficiaries are concentrated in Republican districts, meaning red-state voters\u2014many of whom rely on ACA subsidies and Medicaid\u2014would be disproportionately harmed by GOP efforts to cut healthcare access. The article highlights that rural hospitals depend on ACA and Medicaid funding, and states like Texas, Alabama, and Missouri, which rejected Medicaid expansion, face higher uninsured rates and lower life expectancies. The GOP\u2019s refusal to govern responsibly is framed as ideological neglect disguised as freedom, with leaders like Donald Trump using fear tactics and authoritarian rhetoric to distract from policy failure. The article cites growing mobilization among disillusioned Republicans and activists, signaling a potential political realignment driven by empathy and survival. Grassroots media are called upon to counter corporate media\u2019s 'both-sides' framing and expose the human cost of Republican healthcare policy. The article concludes that the 2026 election will be a referendum on compassion, with the GOP\u2019s assault on healthcare seen as self-destructive and morally bankrupt.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 11:15 AM\nSource:[EgbertoWillies.com](https://egbertowillies.com/2025/10/29/killing-obamacare-means-killing-their-base-the-gops-2026-disaster/)\n\n**Ground Game: Republicans face voter anger over health care premiums, US and China say a trade deal is closer**\nRepublicans are facing growing voter anger over rising health care premiums, as the government shutdown enters its fourth week with no resolution in sight. The core issue is a Democratic demand to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies enacted in 2021, which are set to expire at the end of 2025. President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have stated they will consider extending the enhanced tax credits only after Democrats agree to reopen the government. In the interim, enrollees are receiving notifications of significant premium increases for 2026. As town halls fill with frustrated voters and no coherent Republican plan emerges, the issue is gaining political momentum ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Some Republicans dispute projections that ACA premiums could more than double without the subsidies, calling them exaggerated and arguing the law enables fraud and abuse. Democrats note their 2018 House flip was fueled by public backlash over the GOP\u2019s attempt to repeal Obamacare, and they anticipate a similar political outcome in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:56 PM\nSource:[AP NEWS](https://apnews.com/newsletter/ground-game/october-27-2025)\n\n**Shutdown fight reopens debate in GOP over health care - The Boston Globe**\nDemocrats in Congress are refusing to support a government funding deal unless Republicans extend expiring Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which would prevent premium increases and coverage losses for millions of Americans. This stance has forced Republicans to confront internal divisions: while hard-line members like Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, continue to demand full repeal of the ACA, others acknowledge that doing so without a viable replacement would be politically disastrous. Former President Trump has not clearly articulated an alternative, and Republican leaders like Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have avoided detailing their health care plan, instead framing the issue as a distraction. Despite this, 14 House Republicans from competitive districts and several GOP senators support extending the credits. Johnson has admitted the ACA\u2019s 'roots are so deep' that repeal is no longer feasible. Democrats argue that Republican opposition to the credits\u2014popular across the political spectrum\u2014will backfire politically, citing a 2018 midterm election where health care was a key issue and Democrats gained 40 House seats. Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi attributed the victory to Republican health care proposals that harmed vulnerable groups. Johnson\u2019s claim that Republicans are 'fixing health care' is undermined by the fact that Trump\u2019s tax law, projected to reduce premiums by only 0.6% by 2034, would also cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries countered that Republicans have attempted over 70 times to repeal the ACA without success, making them untrustworthy on the issue. A recent Senate Majority PAC poll found that voters prioritize health care over shutdown concerns by a 2-to-1 margin, giving Democrats strategic leverage.

According to a KFF tracking poll, 78% of Americans, including 59% of Republicans, favor extending subsidies. Republicans have proposed holding a vote on extension after a government shutdown, but this is not equivalent to actually extending them. While some within the GOP prioritize political survival over healthcare policy, others remain ideologically opposed to the ACA, viewing it as a failure, and seek to dismantle its marketplaces. The article notes that the political landscape has changed since 2010 or 2017, with the Trump administration's actions removing previous constraints on GOP policy ambitions. The GOP has strengthened gerrymandering, potentially securing House control through 2026, and could use the period before the 2026 midterms to dismantle Democratic priorities. The article warns that when premium increases occur, Republicans may blame Democrats, claiming the ACA is a disaster, and could use a reconciliation bill\u2014requiring only 51 Senate votes\u2014to repeal the ACA next year, viewing it as their best and last opportunity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:39 PM\nSource:[Crooks and Liars](https://crooksandliars.com/2025/10/will-republicans-take-their-shot)\n\n**U.S. Federal Government 'Walking Toward Longest Shutdown in History,' as Healthcare Subsidies Dispute Deepens**\nThe U.S. federal government is on the brink of experiencing one of the longest shutdowns in American history, with the 13th day of the shutdown marked by President of the House of Representatives Mike Johnson stating he was unaware of the mass dismissal of federal employees by the Trump administration. The Associated Press described the dismissals as highly unusual, widely viewed as an effort to shrink government scope during the shutdown. Johnson, from Louisiana, warned, 'We are walking fast toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history.' The shutdown has halted routine government operations, closed Smithsonian museums and other cultural institutions, and disrupted airport flights, adding uncertainty to an already fragile economy. The House of Representatives is not in session, with Johnson refusing to recall lawmakers to Washington, while the Senate, closed due to a federal holiday, will reconvene on Tuesday. However, senators are stalled in failed votes, as Democrats refuse to compromise on healthcare demands. Johnson thanked President Donald Trump for ensuring military personnel are paid this week, reducing a major pressure point that might have led to negotiations. The Coast Guard is also receiving pay, confirmed by a senior government official speaking anonymously. The shutdown centers on the expiration of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), which affect millions relying on government assistance to afford health insurance. Democrats demand extension of subsidies, while Republicans argue the issue can be addressed later. With Congress and the White House deadlocked, the end of November is seen as a potential deadline for reopening the government, when enrollment begins for the health program and Americans face the prospect of sharply increased insurance premiums. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that monthly costs would double if subsidies are not renewed by December 31. This is also when federal employees, including thousands of House staffers, will go unpaid. The healthcare debate has persisted since the Affordable Care Act was signed by President Barack Obama in 2010. The U.S. previously endured a 16-day shutdown under Obama in 2013 when Republicans sought to repeal the law. Trump attempted to repeal and replace the law in 2017, but the effort failed when Senator John McCain voted against it. With 24 million enrollees in Obamacare\u2014the highest ever\u2014Johnson said it is unlikely Republicans will pursue repeal again, citing 'post-traumatic stress' from the failed attempt.

The sweeping tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump this summer, though not officially marketed as a repeal, significantly undermined the law and is projected to remove millions of people who gained insurance under the ACA from coverage. This legislative move has become politically contentious: as a partial government shutdown enters its second week, the White House and many congressional Republicans are concerned that Democrats' demand to extend pandemic-era subsidies\u2014set to expire at the end of the year\u2014resonates strongly with voters, including Republican ones. These subsidies help low- and middle-income Americans afford health insurance on the ACA marketplaces. Republican leaders have expressed willingness to discuss extending the subsidies only after the government reopens. Democrats are betting that either Republicans will concede due to electoral risks in the upcoming midterms, or they will hold firm, allowing Democrats to leverage healthcare as a central campaign issue to regain control of the House. Millions of individuals on the individual marketplaces have already received notices indicating premium increases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 09:14 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

These premium tax credits, initially expanded during the COVID-19 pandemic to increase financial assistance and broaden eligibility, help millions of Americans afford health insurance through the marketplace. Democrats argue that failing to extend the subsidies before the November 1 open enrollment period could lead to dramatic premium increases\u2014estimates from the Congressional Budget Office project a 4.3% rise in 2026 and 7.7% in 2027, while a KFF analysis predicts an average 114% increase, from $888 to $1,904 per year. A KFF poll found 78% of Americans, including over half of Republicans and 'Make America Great Again' supporters, support extending the enhanced credits. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries warned that without extension, tens of millions would face thousands of dollars in higher premiums, co-pays, and deductibles annually. Experts like Melinda Buntin of Johns Hopkins and Naomi Zewde of UCLA emphasize that low-income working families, particularly in non-Medicaid expansion states, would be disproportionately affected. Republicans, led by House Speaker Mike Johnson, argue the issue is distant and prefer a 'clean' continuing resolution to reopen the government without addressing subsidies, promising future discussions. However, Democrats refuse to support a clean bill without health care negotiations, creating a deadlock. President Donald Trump claimed to be negotiating with Democrats on health care, even expressing openness to a deal, but later reversed course, insisting the government must reopen first. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denied any White House negotiations. Legal expert James Blumstein suggests a retroactive fix is possible, and that the issue may resurface in five to six weeks when leverage shifts. The Department of Health and Human Services blamed Senate Democrats for the shutdown, stating they are blocking government reopening and endangering health programs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-subsidies-sticking-point-government-shutdown/story?id=126322841)\n\n**Obamacare in the spotlight as US govt shutdown deepens**\nThe U.S. government shutdown entered its third day on October 3, 2025, with no resolution in sight, as Congress remains deadlocked over funding and the future of enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare. The dispute centers on whether to extend ACA subsidies\u2014expanded during the pandemic and set to expire at the end of 2025\u2014before reopening federal operations. Democrats insist that any funding bill must include an extension of these subsidies, which currently help over 22 million Americans afford health insurance, with the Kaiser Family Foundation projecting that average out-of-pocket premiums could more than double\u2014from $888 to $1,904\u2014without them. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 4.2 million people could lose coverage if the subsidies lapse. Republicans oppose linking funding to subsidies, arguing they cost an estimated $350 billion through 2034 and distort insurance markets, demanding broader fiscal reforms first. President Donald Trump has amplified the divide by falsely claiming Democrats seek over $1 trillion in healthcare funding for undocumented immigrants, despite non-citizens being ineligible for ACA coverage. Democrats have instead proposed restoring eligibility for certain legal immigrants, whose access was restricted by a Trump-backed tax law, potentially leaving 1.4 million lawfully present immigrants without insurance. Public opinion, per a Washington Post flash poll, shows nearly half of Americans blame Republicans and Trump for the shutdown, with independents more than twice as likely to fault the GOP. While some Senate Republicans have floated compromise ideas\u2014such as a one-year extension with phased reductions\u2014House conservatives remain resistant. The timing is critical: open enrollment for health insurance begins in November, and insurers must set 2026 rates without clarity on subsidy extensions. Rural and older populations, often in Republican-leaning areas, could be disproportionately affected. Despite signs of potential compromise, including support from vulnerable House members and Senate Republicans drafting guardrails, a deal remains unlikely until the immediate funding issue is resolved. The standoff underscores a deeper national debate over the federal government\u2019s role in ensuring affordable healthcare.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 06:39 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/world/obamacare-barack-obama-donald-trump-republicans-democrats-affordable-care-act-united-states-of-america-13938879.html)\n\n**House advances stopgap bill to avert government shutdown**\nThe Republican\u2011controlled House cleared a vote for a stopgap funding measure that would keep federal agencies funded through Nov.\u202f21, giving lawmakers time to agree on full appropriations for fiscal year\u202f2026, which starts Oct.\u202f1.

President Joe Biden credited the surge to his administration\u2019s efforts to lower health care and prescription drug costs, simplify enrollment, and strengthen the ACA, Medicare, and Medicaid. The increase is attributed to expanded tax credits, which have made coverage more affordable for millions. However, these tax credits are set to expire at the end of 2025 unless Congress enacts new legislation. Incoming President-elect Donald Trump, who previously sought to dismantle the ACA during his first term and has criticized it as 'costly' and offering 'lousy' coverage, has not presented a detailed replacement plan. During his first term, enrollment declined due to reduced funding and fewer navigator resources. A coalition of major health care entities, including top insurers, health systems, and medical associations, has formed the 'Keep Americans Covered' campaign to lobby Congress to extend the tax credits.

    "summary": "Experts across the fields of health policy, political science, public policy, and health economics are broadly aligned in forecasting a low probability that major components of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be repealed or curtailed before January 1, 2026. Their probabilities generally range from about 7% to 27%, with most clustered between 7% and 22%. Key drivers for the low probability include the resilience of the ACA to prior repeal attempts (particularly noting failures in 2017 even under unified GOP control), high public support (including among Republican voters and in red states), strong mobilization of stakeholders and interest groups to defend the law, and acute electoral risks for Republicans with the 2026 midterms looming. GOP control of the presidency and Congress and the technical potential to use budget reconciliation marginally increase the chances for change, but are consistently outweighed by internal Republican divisions, lack of a filibuster-proof Senate majority, procedural hurdles, and Democratic unity and leverage (heightened by recent electoral gains). Several experts highlight the significance of political and policy feedback effects: over time, the ACA has produced large groups of beneficiaries (voters, insurers, hospitals) and has become deeply embedded, making retrenchment especially costly and unlikely. The prevailing scenario sees ongoing partisan standoff and only minor or incremental changes\u2014such as expiring subsidy enhancements\u2014not sufficient to meet the question's threshold of three major components repealed or curtailed. While a last-minute GOP reconciliation push is described as theoretically possible, the consensus is that the inertia, political risks, and lack of party unity or an accepted alternative make a sweeping rollback highly improbable before 2026.",
