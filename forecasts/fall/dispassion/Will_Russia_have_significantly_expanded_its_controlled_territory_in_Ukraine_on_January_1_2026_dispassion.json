The most significant advances occurred on the Kharkiv direction near the settlement of Milove (15.8 km\u00b2) and the Siversk direction toward Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast (15.88 km\u00b2). The Pokrovsk direction in Donetsk Oblast saw a 14.45 km\u00b2 gain, down from 19.16 km\u00b2 the prior week. The Novopavlivsk direction, spanning Zaporizhzhia, Dnipro, and Donetsk Oblasts, saw a continued decline in gains\u201419.45 km\u00b2 compared to 34.34 km\u00b2 the previous week. The 'gray zone' of uncertain control expanded by 48.6 km\u00b2, the largest weekly increase since early October, with the biggest growth on the Novopavlivsk direction (36.11 km\u00b2) and Pokrovsk direction (12 km\u00b2). Overall, Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 12.8 km\u00b2 per day, while the 'gray zone' grew by 6.9 km\u00b2 daily. This marks a significant rise from mid-August (10.7 km\u00b2/day) and early September, when rates were 1.5 times lower.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 11:44 AM\nSource:[\u0406\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0430\u043a\u0441-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430](https://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1119323.html)\n\n**War in Ukraine: Full-Scale Russian Invasion and International Response**\nOn the morning of February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine without declaring war, occupying several Ukrainian cities and strategically important sites, including the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. By April 8, 2022, Ukraine\u2019s Armed Forces had fully liberated Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Chernihiv, and Sumy oblasts. According to UN data, the Russian aggression has resulted in at least 10,582 civilian deaths and 19,875 injuries, including 587 children. Cities and villages have been destroyed, leaving many Ukrainians homeless and displaced as refugees. As of July 1, 2024, approximately 44,000 Ukrainian refugees reside in Lithuania under the EU\u2019s temporary protection mechanism. Western countries support Ukraine with military aid, humanitarian assistance, refugee reception, and grants for reconstruction projects. On February 28, 2022, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy submitted Ukraine\u2019s application for EU membership, and many European parliamentarians and EU leaders have called for accelerated processing.

He reiterated that talks are only possible if Russian interests are respected. Lavrov claimed that U.S.-Russia agreements reached during a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump in Anchorage on August 15, 2024, remain valid, with key proposals originally formulated by Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff in June 2024. Putin\u2019s main demands include Ukraine\u2019s renunciation of NATO membership and withdrawal of forces from four regions\u2014Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia\u2014territories Russia has declared part of its federation following illegal referendums. As of November 2025, Russia controls approximately 19% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, nearly all of Luhansk, about 80% of Donetsk, and roughly three-quarters of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, with partial occupation in Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv, and Dnipro regions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy affirmed that while some areas may be temporarily under de facto occupation, Ukraine will not legally recognize Russian control, as doing so would threaten not only Ukraine but European security. Lavrov also claimed that the U.S. has signaled it does not question Russia\u2019s territorial integrity or the right of Crimeans, Donbas residents, and people from 'Novorossiya' to reunite with their 'historical homeland.' The term 'Novorossiya' refers to a historically contested region in southeastern Ukraine and is used by Russian occupiers and pro-Russian separatists to justify territorial claims. Additionally, Lavrov warned of 'countermeasures' against the EU\u2019s plan to use frozen 210 billion euros in Russian assets to support Ukraine, calling the move legally baseless. He noted that the U.S. has informally communicated interest in preserving the limits of the New START treaty beyond its expiration in February 2026. Meanwhile, Finnish President Alexander Stubb speculated that Putin might attend the G20 summit in South Africa in late November 2025, possibly meeting with Trump and potentially Zelenskyy.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 01:28 AM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/novosti-rossii/lavrov-rozmriyavsya-pro-zustrich-rubio-yaki-vimogi-visunuli-u-putina.htm)\n\n**Russia Intensifies Attacks on Ukraine\u2019s Energy Infrastructure Ahead of Winter**\nOn Saturday, November 8, 2025, Ukraine suffered a large-scale Russian attack on its energy infrastructure, resulting in four deaths and widespread power and water outages across multiple regions, including the capital, Kyiv. The Russian military intensified bombardments targeting gas and electricity facilities nationwide, particularly in the eastern region, as part of a broader effort to seize control of the strategic logistics hub of Pokrovsk. According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russia launched 458 drones and 45 missiles, with Ukraine claiming to have intercepted 409 drones and nine missiles. The attacks caused significant damage, including a drone strike on a nine-story residential building in Dnipro, killing three people, and another death in Kharkiv. Power and water cuts were reported in Kharkiv, Kremenchuk, and Kyiv, with DTEK, a private utility operator, confirming disruptions. The railway system also experienced major delays, as the Ministry of Reconstruction, Oleksii Kuleba, accused Russia of targeting locomotive depots. In the south, drones struck energy infrastructure in Odesa on Friday night. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the attacks targeted Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex and energy facilities supporting military operations. Since the invasion began in February 2022, daily attacks have severely damaged power plants and gas infrastructure. A report from the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) in October 2025 projected that over 25% of Ukraine\u2019s electricity demand will remain unmet during the upcoming winter. In response, Ukraine has launched increasingly distant drone attacks into Russian territory, aiming to disrupt oil exports and undermine Russia\u2019s war financing. A drone strike on infrastructure in Volgograd, Russia, caused power interruptions. With diplomatic talks stalled, most combat is concentrated in Donetsk Oblast, where Pokrovsk\u2014a key logistical center\u2014may fall in the coming days. Its capture would mark Russia\u2019s largest territorial gain since Vuhledar (October 2024) and Avdiivka (February 2024). Russia currently controls nearly 20% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, which was annexed in 2014, according to an analysis by AFP based on data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Critical Threats Project (CTP).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 04:48 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/noticias/mundo/europa/russia-intensifica-ataques-a-infraestrutura-de-energia-da-ucrania-as-vesperas-do-inverno,973321dfdda4a9dd46da1e315e2c734aoaa1rnao.html)\n\n**Ukraine: Four Dead and Power Outages After Russian Attack with Over 400 Drones**\nOn Saturday, Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine using over 400 drones and 45 missiles, targeting energy infrastructure across the country. The assault resulted in four deaths, widespread power outages, and disruptions to water and heating supplies. According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russia fired 458 drones and 45 missiles during the night of Friday to Saturday, with Ukrainian air defenses intercepting 406 drones and nine missiles. President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that repair efforts were ongoing and criticized the international response as insufficient, calling Russia's actions 'brazen.' The attacks damaged critical infrastructure, including power plants, gas networks, and railways. In Dnipro, a nine-story residential building was partially destroyed by a drone strike, killing three people, while one person died in Kharkiv. Power outages affected Kyiv and its surroundings, as reported by the private electricity distributor DTEK, and gas company Naftogaz confirmed damage to facilities, noting this was the ninth such attack on Ukraine\u2019s energy sector since October 2024. Ukraine\u2019s Minister of Rebuilding Oleksiy Kuleba warned of major train service delays due to Russian strikes on locomotive depots. Russia claimed to have targeted Ukrainian military-industrial and energy facilities. In Russia\u2019s Volgograd region, a drone attack also caused power outages. Since the start of the invasion in February 2022, Russia has inflicted severe damage on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. In response, Ukraine has conducted long-range drone strikes on Russian energy sites to disrupt oil exports and reduce funding for Moscow\u2019s war effort. The fighting remains intense in Donbas, particularly around the strategic city of Bakhmut, which could fall in the coming days\u2014marking Russia\u2019s largest military gain since capturing Avdiivka in February 2024 and Vuhledar in October 2024. According to a French news agency analysis based on data from the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Russian forces now control approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory, up from 7% before the invasion, including Crimea and parts of Donbas.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/ar/%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7/20251108-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9)\n\n**Russian Forces Accelerate Advance in Eastern Ukraine, Expanding Control and 'Gray Zone' by 43% Week-on-Week**\nAccording to OSINT project DeepState, Russian forces increased their control over Ukrainian territory by 89.8 km\u00b2 from November 3 to November 10, 2025, a 43.4% increase compared to the previous week's 62.63 km\u00b2. The most significant advances occurred on the Kharkiv direction near the settlement of Milove (15.8 km\u00b2) and the Siversk direction toward Kostiantynivka in Donetsk Oblast (15.88 km\u00b2). The Pokrovsk direction in Donetsk Oblast saw a 14.45 km\u00b2 gain, down from 19.16 km\u00b2 the prior week.

Overall, Russian forces advanced at an average rate of 12.8 km\u00b2 per day, while the 'gray zone' grew by 6.9 km\u00b2 daily. This marks a significant rise from mid-August (10.7 km\u00b2/day) and early September, when rates were 1.5 times lower.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 11:44 AM\nSource:[\u0406\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0444\u0430\u043a\u0441-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430](https://ua.interfax.com.ua/news/general/1119323.html)\n\n**Russia Intensifies Attacks on Ukraine\u2019s Energy Infrastructure Ahead of Winter**\nOn Saturday, November 8, 2025, Ukraine suffered a large-scale Russian attack on its energy infrastructure, resulting in four deaths and widespread power and water outages across multiple regions, including the capital, Kyiv. The Russian military intensified bombardments targeting gas and electricity facilities nationwide, particularly in the eastern region, as part of a broader effort to seize control of the strategic logistics hub of Pokrovsk. According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russia launched 458 drones and 45 missiles, with Ukraine claiming to have intercepted 409 drones and nine missiles. The attacks caused significant damage, including a drone strike on a nine-story residential building in Dnipro, killing three people, and another death in Kharkiv. Power and water cuts were reported in Kharkiv, Kremenchuk, and Kyiv, with DTEK, a private utility operator, confirming disruptions. The railway system also experienced major delays, as the Ministry of Reconstruction, Oleksii Kuleba, accused Russia of targeting locomotive depots. In the south, drones struck energy infrastructure in Odesa on Friday night. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed the attacks targeted Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex and energy facilities supporting military operations. Since the invasion began in February 2022, daily attacks have severely damaged power plants and gas infrastructure. A report from the Kyiv School of Economics (KSE) in October 2025 projected that over 25% of Ukraine\u2019s electricity demand will remain unmet during the upcoming winter. In response, Ukraine has launched increasingly distant drone attacks into Russian territory, aiming to disrupt oil exports and undermine Russia\u2019s war financing. A drone strike on infrastructure in Volgograd, Russia, caused power interruptions. With diplomatic talks stalled, most combat is concentrated in Donetsk Oblast, where Pokrovsk\u2014a key logistical center\u2014may fall in the coming days. Its capture would mark Russia\u2019s largest territorial gain since Vuhledar (October 2024) and Avdiivka (February 2024).

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy reported that over 300 Russian soldiers have entered the city amid intense house-to-house combat. Ukraine has deployed elite special forces and military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov personally oversaw the operation, signaling its high strategic importance. The fall of Pokrovsk would mark the most significant Russian advance since capturing Avdiivka in February 2023, though the 30-kilometer distance between the two cities underscores the slow pace of Russia\u2019s progress and the heavy casualties incurred. Despite Russia\u2019s persistent efforts since July, the city remains a critical rail hub and elevated position for drone operations, making it strategically valuable for both sides. Ukraine\u2019s army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi reported diverting Russian forces by launching attacks near Dobropillia. According to Bloomberg calculations based on DeepState data, Russia captured 3,386 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory in the first 10 months of 2025\u201454% more than in the same period of 2024\u2014but this still represents only 3% of the total territory Russia claims in eastern and southern Ukraine and 0.6% of the entire country it initially sought to conquer. Analysts like Mykola Bielieskov note that while a Russian capture of Pokrovsk would not yield a decisive strategic advantage due to insufficient troop reserves, it could have negative implications for Ukraine\u2019s future negotiations and international perception. Russian tactics now emphasize relentless pressure, drone swarms, and high casualty tolerance. US President Donald Trump has urged a ceasefire along existing lines, a proposal Zelenskiy accepted but Putin has rejected, with Trump later canceling a planned second summit in Budapest due to Russia\u2019s unwillingness to compromise. Russian military bloggers report ongoing street-level fighting in Pokrovsk, though these claims are unverified. The city, once a coal-mining center with over 60,000 residents, has been devastated and now hosts only about 1,300 people, according to local authorities. Ukrainian officials stress that holding Pokrovsk is critical to maintaining morale, supply lines, and strategic leverage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 07:07 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/news/world/ukraine-digs-in-to-try-to-halt-biggest-russian-win-in-two-years-11762542043475.html)\n\n**Red Army City on Brink of Fall: Russia\u2019s Most Significant Military Gain in Over Two Years**\nAccording to a report by The New York Times on November 6, 2025, Russia is concentrating firepower and troops on Pokrovsk (formerly Red Army City), a key city in eastern Ukraine. If Russia captures Pokrovsk, it would mark the largest territorial gain on the Russian-Ukrainian front in over two years, and the most significant achievement since the capture of Bakhmut two and a half years ago. The city has been heavily damaged during the war and serves as a gateway to the most contested region of Donetsk. Although Ukrainian leadership claims that Ukrainian forces are reclaiming nearby areas, open-source intelligence group 'Deep State' reports on battlefield maps indicate that Russian forces have likely gained control of the southwestern edge of Pokrovsk in recent days. The maps also show that Russian forces have established small detachments in the city center and western areas, while most of Pokrovsk is marked as contested gray territory. Ukrainian Chief of General Staff Syrskyi stated on November 7 that Ukrainian forces are intensifying attacks around Dobropillya to relieve pressure on the vulnerable Pokrovsk. Ukrainian forces currently stationed in Pokrovsk are outnumbered by Russian forces, and Russian drones have full control of the local airspace. The city, which had about 60,000 residents shortly after the war began in February 2022, now has only around 1,000 residents left. Moscow aims to capture the entire Donetsk region after securing Luhansk, with Pokrovsk being a critical step. Capturing the entire Donbas region, including Luhansk and Donetsk, was a major objective of Russian President Putin when he launched the full-scale invasion over two years ago. Military analysts largely predict that Pokrovsk may fall within weeks. According to Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Russian forces have amassed 170,000 troops in the Donetsk region, giving Russian forces an 8-to-1 advantage over Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 04:11 PM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/122663/9125528)\n\n**After Months of Fighting - Putin is Close to a Major Victory in Pokrovsk**\nRussia has been engaged in a prolonged campaign for approximately 21 months to capture Pokrovsk, a strategically vital city in eastern Ukraine. The city is critical for Ukraine\u2019s defense of the Donetsk region, as it lies along key supply routes, including major roads and a railway line. Despite Ukraine\u2019s strong resistance and President Volodymyr Zelenskyj\u2019s recent visit to the city to boost morale, Russian forces are now on the verge of encircling the remaining Ukrainian troops, potentially leading to the city\u2019s fall within days. This would mark Ukraine\u2019s most significant territorial loss in months and would bring Russian forces just 16 kilometers from the Dnepropetrovsk region border. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports that Russia\u2019s progress has been driven by its ability to overcome Ukraine\u2019s previously effective drone units. Russia\u2019s advance from Avdiivka\u2014captured in February 2024\u2014over 45 kilometers to Pokrovsk has cost thousands of lives on both sides. The intense focus on Pokrovsk has delayed further advances toward Kupjansk in the Kharkiv region, which remains partially under Ukrainian control. A Russian victory in Pokrovsk would allow Moscow to redirect military resources elsewhere, signaling a major shift in the eastern front of the war.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[B.T.](https://www.bt.dk/udland/efter-maaneders-kamp--putin-er-taet-paa-at-tage-kaempe-sejr)\n\n**Russian Forces Continue Advances in Ukraine, Capture 461 sq km in October Amid Ongoing Eastern Front Push**\nAccording to an analysis by AFP of data from the Washington-based think tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), Russian forces continued their slow advance into Ukraine in October 2025, capturing 461 square kilometers of territory, with a primary focus on Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. The war has now lasted nearly four years, and Donetsk remains the most contested area, with Russian forces currently controlling approximately 81% of the region. Ukrainian forces are actively defending key towns such as Pokrovsk. The 461 square kilometers captured in October are consistent with the average monthly gains for the year but significantly lower than the 634 square kilometers captured in July. Russia has previously demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk as a precondition for peace talks, but Kyiv has rejected these terms.

Ukrainian forces liberated 11.67 km\u00b2 on the Pokrovsk direction, compared to 29.29 km\u00b2 the week before. The most significant Russian advances occurred on the Novopavlivsk direction, where they captured 34.34 km\u00b2\u2014down from 52.36 km\u00b2 the prior week and 31.79 km\u00b2 two weeks earlier\u2014indicating a return to pre-peak rates. On the Pokrovsk direction, Russian forces gained 19.16 km\u00b2, but after accounting for Ukrainian countermeasures, net gains were comparable to those on the Novopavlivsk axis. On the Kupiansk direction in Kharkiv Oblast, Russia gained 8.78 km\u00b2 at the start and end of the week, though no advances were recorded in the M\u0456love and Vovchansk areas, where activity had been high in October. No territorial gains were reported in Sumy Oblast or near Kostyantynivka, where only 0.46 km\u00b2 was captured at the end of the week. The 'gray zone' of uncertain control expanded most significantly on the Kupiansk direction (by 16.91 km\u00b2), while it decreased by 9.5 km\u00b2 on the Novopavlivsk axis and by 8.18 km\u00b2 near the border in the Dvorichna and Lyman-2 areas. The 'gray zone' also grew by 7.95 km\u00b2 on the Pokrovsk direction and 5.52 km\u00b2 near Kostyantynivka. Overall, the 'gray zone' increased by 13.9 km\u00b2, down from 41.5 km\u00b2 the previous week and 51.46 km\u00b2 the week before.

Ukraine reported that its forces were still holding the city, though conditions were described as difficult. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project Deep State indicated Russian control of a small southern part of Pokrovsk, with most of the city remaining a grey zone under no clear control. Ukraine\u2019s 7th Rapid Response Corps confirmed ongoing operations to clear Russian troops and thwarted a Russian attempt to cut off a supply route from Rodynske. Pokrovsk, with a pre-war population of around 60,000, has seen most civilians flee. Capturing it could allow Russia to advance toward Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, the last major Ukrainian-held cities in Donetsk. Meanwhile, Ukraine reported recent gains near Dobropillia, where it recaptured over 185 square km (71 square miles) of territory. If captured, Pokrovsk would be Russia\u2019s most significant territorial gain in Ukraine since Avdiivka in early 2024. The war has now lasted over three years and eight months, with no face-to-face peace talks since July, despite U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to restart negotiations. Russia also conducted heavy overnight strikes on Ukrainian military airfields, repair bases, industrial facilities, and gas infrastructure.

The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine concluded that Russia's actions\u2014targeting people, homes, humanitarian distribution points, and essential energy infrastructure\u2014have compelled thousands to evacuate. The attacks, which have occurred nearly daily since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, now extend over more than 300 km along the Dniepr River across the regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, and Mykola\u00efv. The report expands earlier findings from May 2025, which had already classified drone attacks in Kherson as 'murder' as a crime against humanity, to now include the crime of 'forced transfer of population.' The commission also asserts that Russia committed war crimes by deporting and transferring civilians from occupied areas in Zaporijia in 2022 and 2023, forcing them to walk 10\u201315 kilometers through high-risk combat zones to reach Ukrainian lines. Furthermore, since 2024, civilians have been deported from Zaporijia to Georgia via Russia, with a prohibition on re-entry into Russian-controlled Ukrainian territories for 20 to 40 years, according to the report.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 08:26 PM\nSource:[SudOuest.fr](https://www.sudouest.fr/international/europe/ukraine/guerre-en-ukraine-un-nouveau-crime-contre-l-humanite-de-la-part-de-la-russie-accuse-une-enquete-de-l-onu-26501073.php)\n\n**Battlefield Map October 27, 2025: Where Ukrainian Forces Advanced and Russian Troops Attacked**\nOn October 27, 2025, 24 KANAL reported on the evolving battlefield situation in Ukraine, citing data from DeepStateMAP. Heavy fighting continues across Sumy, Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Dnipro, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson regions, with Donetsk remaining the top priority for Russian forces. Key conflict zones include Vovchansk, Kupiansk, Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Pokrovsk, and the Lymanske direction. Despite increased Russian attacks\u20141,061 in total over the week of October 20\u201326, peaking at 202 per day\u2014no major line-of-contact shifts were recorded on the Sumy, Kupiansk, Lymanske, Severiansk, Kramatorsk, Kostiantynivka, Hulyaipole, and Prydniprovsk directions. In Vovchansk, Russian forces claimed control of 70% of the city, which is untrue; however, they did advance near the city and expanded the 'gray zone.' On October 26, Ukrainian forces struck the Belgorod Reservoir dam north of Vovchansk, lowering water levels by 1 meter and flooding Russian positions in Belgorod Oblast and near Shebekino. This action reportedly shifted the tactical balance in favor of Ukraine. On the Lymanske front, the front line remained unchanged, but the gray zone expanded within and around Lymansk, with Russian forces infiltrating through forests. Ukrainian forces destroyed a Russian group on the outskirts and continue countering infiltration, despite increased drone and small-unit pressure. On the Drobypilskyi front, Ukrainian forces achieved significant gains: liberated Kucheryiv Yar (after August occupation), captured over 50 Russian soldiers, rescued 10 civilians, and advanced near Novoshakheve. They also liberated Sukhetske and Zatishok, disrupting Russian plans to encircle Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad. In Pokrovsk, Russian forces have entrenched with around 200 troops; the gray zone reached Zakhysnykiv Ukrainy Street and extended to the railway station, with infiltration between Kotlyne and Zvirove. On the Dnipro direction, Russians advanced near Ivanivka and occupied Kalynivka, Verbove, and parts of Zlagoda, Yehorivka, Vysneve, and Oleksandrivka. The gray zone is now 9 km from Pokrovsk. In Zaporizhzhia, Russians captured Poltavka, broke into Novovasylivske, and advanced in Novohryhorivtsi, threatening Hulyaipole. On the Orikhiv direction, a large mechanized assault failed; most Russian equipment was destroyed before reaching Ukrainian positions, though infantry infiltrated Mala Tokmachka. Despite Russian propaganda claims of progress, the front remains static. In Kherson, Russian forces falsely claimed a parachute landing in Korabel, but no such forces are present. Instead, they intensified attacks on Korabel with drones and artillery, while conducting 'drone safaris' targeting civilians to train operators. Ukrainian forces also continue to strike Russian infrastructure, including energy, rail, and kindergartens, indicating Moscow's intent to destroy Ukraine rather than seek peace.

Initial Russian advances toward Kyiv and Kherson peaked in March 2022, with Mariupol surrounded. Ukraine repelled Russian forces near Kyiv by April 2, 2022, and launched its first counteroffensive on August 29, 2022. In September 2022, Russia illegally annexed Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, though it did not fully control them. Ukrainian forces reclaimed significant territory in Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Kherson by November 2022, including Kherson. Russia claimed control of Bakhmut on May 22, 2023, after months of fighting. The second Ukrainian counteroffensive began on June 6, 2023, but was disrupted by the explosion of the Kakhovka Dam. By fall 2023, the offensive ended with minimal territorial gains. Russian forces took full control of Avdiivka on February 18, 2024. The U.S. House of Representatives approved a $61 billion aid package for Ukraine on April 19, 2024. Russia launched a new offensive in Kharkiv on May 10, 2024, capturing villages. Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia's Kursk region on August 6, 2024, holding territory temporarily. Donald Trump was inaugurated as U.S. president on January 20, 2025, raising uncertainty about continued U.S. support. Moscow claimed all Ukrainian forces were expelled from Kursk by April 26, 2025, and Putin visited the region in a show of strength. Ukraine conducted Operation Spider Web on June 1, 2025, using drones to strike airfields deep inside Russia. Both sides intensified drone warfare in summer 2025. Russia claimed full control of Luhansk on June 30, 2025, and of Chasiv Yar on July 31, 2025, after a prolonged assault. Russian forces advanced in Donetsk, capturing villages and nearing Pokrovsk. On August 15, 2025, Putin met Trump in Alaska for the first Russia-U.S. summit in four years.

This marked the smallest territorial gain since May 2025, bringing Russia's total occupation to 19.04% of Ukraine's territory. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief General Oleksandr Syrskyi reported that Ukrainian forces regained 2.2 square kilometers of land in a single day and advanced 100 to 1,400 meters in the Pokrovsk district of Donetsk during assault operations. Syrskyi described Russia's strategy as 'a thousand cuts,' involving small infantry groups of four to six soldiers using terrain to infiltrate Ukrainian lines, disrupt logistics, and capture territory incrementally without large-scale troop deployments. Despite these tactics, Syrskyi stated that 'overall, the situation is under our control' and that Ukraine has had recent successes. Meanwhile, Russia's defense ministry claimed it had gained over 3,308 square kilometers in Donetsk and more than 205 square kilometers in Luhansk since January 1, 2025, along with hundreds of square kilometers in Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, and Dnipropetrovsk. Russia's incremental gains have coincided with a surge in aerial attacks, including a barrage of over 600 drones and missiles in a single weekend\u2014among the largest since the 2022 invasion\u2014killing at least four people.

In September, Russia captured 447 square kilometers of Ukrainian territory, down from 594 km\u00b2 in August and 634 km\u00b2 in July, marking a continued deceleration after a July peak. By the end of September, Russia controlled 19% of Ukraine\u2019s territory, including 7% previously under its control before the full-scale invasion began in February 2022\u2014mainly Crimea and parts of Donbass. The July offensive was the largest since November 2024 (725 km\u00b2), surpassing the more fluid frontlines of spring 2022. The total area captured includes both fully or partially controlled regions and those claimed by Russia. From October 2024 to September 2025, Russia seized over 6,000 km\u00b2\u2014nearly triple the 2,300 km\u00b2 captured in the previous 12 months (October 2023\u2013September 2024). In September, Russia made rapid gains of 416 km\u00b2 between September 1 and 19, but advanced only about 30 km\u00b2 from September 20 to 30.

The frontlines in Donetsk have remained largely static since mid-September, with Russia now controlling approximately 80% of the region (up from 64% a year earlier), after capturing around 400 km\u00b2 per month from May to August.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:49 PM\nSource:[Correio do povo](https://www.correiodopovo.com.br/not%C3%ADcias/mundo/avanco-russo-desacelera-na-ucrania-em-setembro-1.1654141)\n\n**Russian Advances in Ukraine Slow in September, Especially in Donetsk**\nRussian advances in Ukraine slowed significantly in September 2025, particularly in the eastern Donetsk region, according to an AFP analysis based on data from the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW) and the Critical Threats Project (CTP). Russia captured 447 km\u00b2 in September, down from 594 km\u00b2 in August and 634 km\u00b2 in July, marking a continued deceleration after a peak in July. By the end of September, Russia controlled 19% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea and parts of Donbass, which were already under Russian control before the invasion began in February 2022. The July offensive was the most significant since November 2024 (725 km\u00b2), surpassing the early, highly mobile phase of the war in spring 2022. The total area captured by Russia from October 2024 to September 2025 exceeded 6,000 km\u00b2\u2014nearly triple the 2,300 km\u00b2 captured in the previous 12 months (October 2023\u2013September 2024). In September, Russia made rapid gains of 416 km\u00b2 between the 1st and 19th, but slowed dramatically afterward, capturing only about 30 km\u00b2 between the 20th and 30th. The advance stalled primarily in Donetsk, the main battleground for two years, where Russia gained just 181 km\u00b2\u2014its lowest monthly gain in a year. From May to August, Russian forces had captured approximately 400 km\u00b2 per month. In Donetsk, Russian control now stands at 80% (up from 64% a year earlier), with frontlines largely frozen since mid-September.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 01:56 PM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n**A timeline of territorial shifts during Russia's war on Ukraine**\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has been ongoing for three-and-a-half years, with the front line slowly shifting due to unexpected strikes. Here is a timeline of key events in the conflict: Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, but Ukrainian forces defeated Russian troops in Kyiv on April 2, 2022. Ukraine's first counteroffensive started on Aug. 29, 2022, and reclaimed vast parts of the Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, and Kherson regions. Russia claimed control of Bakhmut on May 22, 2023, but Ukraine's second counteroffensive started on June 6, 2023, and ended in fall 2023 with little change to the front line. Russian forces took control of Avdiivka on Feb. 18, 2024, and Ukraine launched a lightning incursion into Russia's Kursk region on Aug. 6, 2024. Trump was inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, 2025, raising uncertainty about U.S. support for Ukraine. Ukraine struck airfields deep inside Russia on June 1, 2025, and both sides stepped up drone strikes in the summer of 2025. Russia took full control of Ukraine's Luhansk on June 30, 2025, and Chasiv Yar on July 31, 2025. Putin met Trump in Alaska on Aug. 15, 2025, to discuss ending the war, but Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said 'We're not going anywhere.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[PBS.org](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/a-timeline-of-territorial-shifts-during-russias-war-on-ukraine)\n\n**Timeline of territorial shifts in Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine**\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine has been ongoing for three-and-a-half years, with the front line moving slowly and unexpectedly.

Over the past three and a half years since Moscow launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine, the front line has slowly shifted with some unexpected attacks that have also redrawn the map. Here are some key events in the conflict. Russia's invasion of Ukraine began on February 24, 2022, with President Vladimir Putin launching a full-scale invasion from the north, east, and south. Russian troops quickly reached the outskirts of Kiev, but their attempts to capture the capital and other cities in the northeast met strong resistance. Ucrania has since launched several counteroffensives, including a major one in September 2022 that recaptured vast areas of the J\u00e1rkiv, Mykolaiv, and Jers\u00f3n regions. However, the conflict has continued to simmer, with Russia launching a new offensive in the northeastern region of J\u00e1rkiv in May 2024 and Ucrania launching a surprise incursion into the Russian region of Kursk in August 2024. The situation remains uncertain, with Trump's election as US President in January 2025 generating uncertainty over whether Washington will continue to support Ukraine. As of August 2025, Russia has taken control of several key cities, including Avdiivka, Kakhovka, and Chasiv Yar, and continues to advance in the Donetsk region. Putin met with Trump in Alaska in August 2025 to discuss a potential end to the war, with Zelenskyy and European leaders saying that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region it controls as part of a deal.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 18, 2025 09:32 AM\nSource:[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/18/cronologa-de-los-cambios-territoriales-en-la-guerra-de-rusia-contra-ucrania/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives\u2014spanning geopolitical risk analysis, defense and military studies, international relations, and area/Russian studies\u2014there is strong convergence on the assessment that Russia is highly unlikely to have significantly expanded its controlled territory in Ukraine, as per the explicit Metaculus/ISW criteria, by January 1, 2026. Experts note that Russia has maintained incremental territorial gains (notably nearing the capture of Pokrovsk), but these have mostly been in rural or peri-urban regions and do not approach the threshold of controlling two or more specified major Ukrainian cities (such as Kharkiv, Odesa, Mykolaiv, Zaporizhzhia, Sumy, Chernihiv, or Lozova) in addition to current holdings.\n\nKey factors driving the low probability consensus are: the extremely slow and costly nature of Russian advances in major urban centers since 2022; the operational, logistical, and force generation constraints on both sides; Ukraine's demonstrated defensive resilience in cities and ongoing (if sometimes reduced) Western support; and the lack of evidence for an imminent Ukrainian political or military collapse or a dramatic cessation of Western aid. Despite a recent modest uptick in Russian operational tempo and the symbolic importance of Pokrovsk, none of the listed major cities are under immediate threat of capture. Winter weather, urban terrain, and the structure of the conflict further limit prospects for a dramatic breakthrough.\n\nMost experts acknowledge the ultra-low-probability scenario of a sudden Ukrainian collapse or extraordinary Russian operational surge but stress that there is no current indication of such developments. All forecasts assign final probabilities of significant Russian territorial expansion by the resolution date between 2% and 4% (majority at 2-3%). The consensus is that the conflict is likely to remain attritional and frontlines broadly stable into early 2026, with any Russian advances falling short of the question\u2019s high bar for 'significant expansion.'",
