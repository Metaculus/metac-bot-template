In preliminary discussions, the company has looked at raising \\$60 billion at the low end and likely \u200cmore, the people said. They cautioned that talks are early and plans - including the figures and timing - could change depending on business growth and market conditions.\n\n> Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has told some associates the company is aiming for a 2027 listing, the people said. But some advisers predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026.\n\nFrom [SiliconAngle](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/29/openai-reportedly-planning-2026-2027-ipo-valuation-1t/):\n\n> If and when the IPO comes, it will be the biggest IPO in history. The current record for money raised in a single IPO was Saudi Aramco, which raised \\$25.6 billion in December 2019. The second-highest and the largest tech IPO to date was Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which raised \\$26 billion in 2014.\n\n> With the restructure complete, OpenAI now has the ability to go public, but how soon is the question. If it does decide to go public, the listing would open doors for OpenAI when it comes to additional capital raising and the ability to make large acquisitions using its stock.\n\n> And if one thing is clear about OpenAI, it\u2019s that it loves new funding. The company has already raised [at least](https://platform.tracxn.com/a/d/company/566fc72ee4b0be04a58d6733/openai.com#a:key-metrics) \\$57.9 billion in funding, more than likely the largest amount ever raised by a single tech startup company.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40572,\"question_id\":40146}}`",

She said, 'IPO is not on the cards right now,' and cautioned against becoming fixated on an IPO timeline. This comes despite prior reports from Reuters suggesting OpenAI was preparing for a potential $1 trillion IPO by 2027, with some advisers predicting a listing as early as late 2026. The company underwent a major restructuring in late October 2025, converting its for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation as part of a deal with Microsoft that valued the company at approximately $500 billion. The new structure, under the non-profit OpenAI Foundation (which now holds a 26% stake and has a warrant for additional shares), grants OpenAI greater operational freedom while maintaining control. The company is expanding its AI and data center projects, entering multibillion-dollar agreements with tech firms like Google and Amazon. Friar also highlighted the need for U.S. government support to guarantee financing for AI chips, which face uncertain depreciation and high debt costs, stating, 'Any such guarantee can really drop the cost of the financing but also increase the loan-to-value.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 02:49 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/openai-is-not-working-on-an-ipo-yet-cfo/articleshow/125120930.cms)\n\n**OpenAI Seeks U.S. Government Support to Boost AI Investment Funding**\nOpenAI, the world's largest private company, is seeking U.S. government guarantees for loans to fund its massive infrastructure expansion, which could cost over one trillion dollars, according to Sarah Friar, the company's CFO, during a Wall Street Journal conference in California on November 5, 2025. Friar stated that government-backed loan guarantees would significantly reduce financing costs and expand the pool of potential lenders, as many financial institutions face strict limits on high-risk lending. The proposal is unusual for a Silicon Valley giant. OpenAI has already committed to approximately one trillion dollars (R$ 5.38 trillion) in infrastructure deals this year alone, including a $300 billion (R$ 1.6 trillion) partnership with Oracle and a $500 billion (R$ 2.69 trillion) Stargate project with Oracle and SoftBank. Friar denied reports that OpenAI is considering an initial public offering (IPO), stating, 'An IPO is not under discussion at this time,' and emphasized that the company's current priority remains growth.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 11:42 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/837Q99J)\n\n**SNAP Q3 Revenue of $1.51 Billion Exceeds Expectations - 36Kr**\nOpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar stated on November 5, 2025, that the company has no immediate plans for an initial public offering (IPO), saying, 'There are currently no IPO plans. We are focused on steadily scaling the company, so we do not want to be constrained by IPO-related discussions.' This comes despite earlier reports suggesting OpenAI aimed to file for its IPO as early as the second half of 2026, with a potential\u4e0a\u5e02 in 2027. The company\u2019s projected valuation could reach approximately $1 trillion, with plans to raise at least $60 billion.

Speaking at the Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference on November 6, 2025, Friar stated that transitioning to a new corporate structure does not signal an imminent IPO, as the company\u2019s current focus remains on growth and research and development rather than profitability. She emphasized, 'IPO is not currently in our plans,' adding that the company is still adapting to scaling up and does not wish to prioritize the IPO process. Although Reuters previously reported that OpenAI is preparing for an IPO and the Wall Street Journal suggested a possible\u4e0a\u5e02 as early as 2027, Friar\u2019s remarks indicate that the company is not currently pursuing public listing. The article was published on November 5, 2025, by Phoenix News (Phoenix Media).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 11:24 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://tech.ifeng.com/c/8o3GnAZu2Zw)\n\n**OpenAI Denies IPO Plans, Focuses on Sustainable Growth and Alternative Funding**\nOpenAI, the developer of the AI chatbot ChatGPT, has denied reports of preparing for a large-scale initial public offering (IPO), stating that there are currently no plans for an IPO. Sarah Friar, OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), made the statement during a panel at the Wall Street Journal's Tech Live conference on November 5, 2025, emphasizing that the company is focused on maintaining sustainable growth at its current scale and does not wish to be constrained by the 'shackles' of an IPO. This comes after Reuters reported in late October 2025 that OpenAI was preparing for an IPO with a target valuation of up to $1 trillion and a potential\u4e0a\u5e02 date in 2027. Friar acknowledged that OpenAI's massive computing and power demands for AI model development and operations make long-term sustainability challenging without significant capital, but she highlighted efforts to explore a broader funding ecosystem\u2014including banks, private equity funds, and government support. She specifically noted that OpenAI hopes the government could guarantee the cost of AI chip procurement, which would lower financing costs and allow higher loan-to-value ratios, enabling greater debt capacity. Friar also defended the company\u2019s current losses, stating they are not due to business underperformance but rather to aggressive investment. She added that if investment levels were reduced, OpenAI could appear more financially stable to external observers. Additionally, OpenAI has recently announced plans to restructure one of its subsidiaries from a nonprofit-controlled entity into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), designed to balance profit and public good.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 10:15 PM\nSource:[KBS](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/pc/view/view.do?ncd=8400132)\n\n**OpenAI Prepares for the Largest IPO in History Amid Record Capital Needs and AI Frenzy**\nOpenAI is preparing what could become the largest initial public offering (IPO) in history, with CEO Sam Altman stating that an IPO is 'the most likely option' given the company's massive capital needs. The company aims to raise at least $60 billion in its IPO, which could occur as early as next year. This would represent a record for a single IPO, surpassing Saudi Aramco\u2019s $25.6 billion raise in December 2019 and Visa\u2019s $18 billion IPO in 2008. OpenAI\u2019s targeted valuation of $1 trillion would make it the tenth-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, on par with Berkshire Hathaway. However, the company is not yet profitable: it is projected to incur a $27 billion loss in 2025 and is not expected to become profitable until 2029. Despite this, investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence is driving strong market interest\u2014nine companies currently valued above $1 trillion are AI-exposed, and OpenAI\u2019s mere mention can cause stock prices to surge. The IPO is made possible by a recent legal restructuring that allows unlimited dividend payments to investors. While Saudi Aramco\u2019s IPO faced delays due to overly ambitious valuation expectations (initially targeting $2 trillion), OpenAI\u2019s current momentum suggests a more favorable market reception, driven by the current AI boom.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 02:43 PM\nSource:[LesEchos.fr](https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/marches-financiers/openai-prepare-la-plus-grande-introduction-en-bourse-de-lhistoire-2195974)\n\n**Media: OpenAI Launches $1 Trillion IPO Preparations, Altman Acknowledges Urgent Funding Needs**\nAccording to Reuters, citing three informed sources, OpenAI has officially begun preparations for its initial public offering (IPO), with a potential valuation of up to $1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history and marking a pivotal moment in the capitalization of the AI industry. The company is considering submitting a confidential filing to regulators as early as the second half of 2026, with a minimum fundraising target of $60 billion, though the final amount is expected to exceed this. The IPO timeline and size remain fluid, dependent on business growth and market conditions. OpenAI's CFO, Sarah Friar, has indicated a goal of completing the listing by 2027, though some advisors predict it could happen as early as late 2026. The company\u2019s official spokesperson reiterated a cautious stance, stating: 'IPO is not our current focus, so we cannot set a specific date. We are committed to building a lasting enterprise and advancing our mission.' The IPO preparations follow a major corporate restructuring, under which the non-profit 'OpenAI Foundation' now holds 26% of the company's equity and future\u589e\u6301 options, reducing OpenAI\u2019s reliance on its largest shareholder, Microsoft, and paving the way for public market entry. Internal sources suggest strategic urgency for the IPO under CEO Sam Altman, who recently stated in a live stream: 'Given the funding needs we face, I would say this is the most likely path forward.' The company\u2019s ambitious global AI infrastructure plans require trillions in investment. Despite rapid growth\u2014projected annual revenue of approximately $20 billion by year-end\u2014ongoing losses due to massive investments have intensified the need for long-term capital. The IPO would not only open more efficient funding channels but also enable large-scale acquisitions through public stock.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://tech.huanqiu.com/article/4Ox0ioiGBhb)\n\n**OpenAI Plans US$1 Trillion IPO, Aiming for Historic Market Entry**\nOpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, is preparing for a potential initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at US$1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history. The company was already the world's most valuable startup in October 2025, following a funding round that valued it at approximately US$500 billion. If the IPO proceeds at US$1 trillion, OpenAI would surpass major corporations such as Walmart (US$815 billion), Oracle (US$732 billion), and Samsung (US$474 billion). According to The Guardian, OpenAI is considering registering for the IPO in the second half of 2026, though CFO Sarah Friar indicated the goal may be to wait until 2027. The company aims to raise at least US$60 billion through the listing. The IPO would support CEO Sam Altman\u2019s ambition to invest trillions in data centers and AI infrastructure. Altman reportedly stated in a live team broadcast that the IPO is the 'most likely' path due to the company's capital needs. However, a company spokesperson confirmed that OpenAI is not focused on an IPO and thus has no set date. The IPO speculation follows a recent corporate restructuring that transformed OpenAI\u2019s main business unit into a for-profit entity named OpenAI Group PBC, a crucial step toward raising billions and advancing AI development. Although the company remains technically controlled by a nonprofit entity, this reorganization facilitates capital acquisition and paves the way for a public listing.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 09:18 PM\nSource:[Canaltech](https://canaltech.com.br/mercado/us-1-trilhao-openai-planeja-entrar-no-mercado-com-valor-recorde-historico/)\n\n**OpenAI Sets Foundation for $1 Trillion IPO Amid AI Market Surge**\nOpenAI is laying the groundwork for an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, making it one of the largest IPOs in history, according to three people familiar with the matter. The company is considering filing with securities regulators as early as the second half of 2026, with plans to raise $60 billion at a minimum\u2014potentially more\u2014though details remain fluid and subject to change based on business growth and market conditions. CFO Sarah Friar has reportedly told associates that the company aims for a public listing in 2027, though some advisors believe it could happen as early as late 2026. OpenAI\u2019s spokesperson stated, 'An IPO is not our focus, so we couldn\u2019t have set a date. We are building a durable business and advancing our mission for everyone to benefit from AGI.' The IPO preparations follow a complex restructuring that reduces OpenAI\u2019s reliance on Microsoft, enabling more efficient capital raising and the use of stock for larger acquisitions to fund CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plans to invest trillions in AI infrastructure. With annualized revenue run rate expected to reach $20 billion by year-end, losses are also rising within the $500 billion valuation company. Altman confirmed during a live stream that an IPO is 'the most likely path' given future capital needs. Originally founded as a nonprofit in 2015, OpenAI later restructured so the nonprofit could oversee the for-profit arm. Now, the OpenAI Foundation holds a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and has a mechanism to receive additional shares upon achieving key milestones, making it a major stakeholder in the company\u2019s financial success. A successful IPO would be a major win for investors including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and MGX of Abu Dhabi, while Microsoft, a key backer, owns approximately 27% after investing $13 billion. The move comes amid a broader surge in public markets driven by AI, highlighted by CoreWeave\u2019s $23 billion IPO\u2014now tripled\u2014and Nvidia\u2019s market cap reaching $5 trillion.

An IPO would provide OpenAI with greater access to capital and the ability to make larger acquisitions using publicly traded shares. The company is projected to generate approximately $20 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2025, despite increasing losses. With over $57 billion in funding raised to date, a successful IPO could push OpenAI\u2019s valuation to $1 trillion, cementing its status as the largest IPO ever.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 10:55 AM\nSource:[techzine.eu](https://www.techzine.eu/news/applications/135876/openai-aims-for-largest-ipo-ever-but-its-holding-off-for-now/)\n\n**OpenAI Prepares for IPO with Potential Valuation Reaching $1 Trillion**\nOpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) that could occur as early as late 2026 or in 2027, according to Reuters, citing three sources familiar with the process. The IPO could value the company at up to one trillion dollars (one billion euros in European terminology), making it one of the largest stock market entries in history. Reuters reports that the company may file for the IPO in the second half of 2026, although some consultants anticipate a possible 2027 timeline. Sarah Friar, OpenAI\u2019s CFO, has reportedly told associates that the company plans to go public in 2027. OpenAI is also considering raising at least $60 billion (\u20ac51.6 billion at current exchange rates), though the process remains in early stages and could change based on business growth and market conditions. A company spokesperson stated that 'an IPO is not the focus' and that 'no date has been set.' This aligns with founder Sam Altman\u2019s prior acknowledgment that going public is 'the most likely path' due to the company\u2019s capital needs.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/openai-prepara-entrada-em-bolsa-com-avaliacao-que-pode-chegar-a-um-triliao-de-dolares/)\n\n**OpenAI Pursues IPO with $1 Trillion Valuation Target**\nOpenAI, the operator of ChatGPT, is pursuing an initial public offering (IPO) with a target enterprise value of $1 trillion (approximately 140 trillion KRW), according to a report by Reuters on October 29 (local time). The company aims to raise $60 billion through the IPO, which would be the largest fundraising in global financial market history. Reuters cited multiple sources indicating that OpenAI is considering submitting an IPO application to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as early as the second half of next year. This would surpass the previous record of $25.6 billion raised by Aramco in 2019, and the prior record of $24.3 billion by Alibaba in 2014. OpenAI's valuation has surged rapidly due to the global AI investment boom: it was valued at $300 billion during a funding round led by SoftBank last year, and rose to $500 billion in early October when former employees sold shares to external investors. Although OpenAI has stated publicly through a spokesperson that it is not currently focused on going public, market observers believe preparatory work for an IPO is already underway. CEO Sam Altman, when asked about IPO feasibility on October 28, said it is 'reasonable to view an IPO as the most likely path' given future capital needs.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 08:37 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025103039091)\n\n**OpenAI Poised for $1 Trillion IPO, Aims for 2026-2027 Listing Amid AI Boom**\nOpenAI, supported by major shareholder Microsoft, is reportedly preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) following a complex corporate restructuring. According to sources cited by Reuters, OpenAI is considering filing for an IPO as early as the second half of 2026, with a potential valuation reaching $1 trillion\u2014making it one of the largest IPOs in history. Preliminary discussions suggest a minimum fundraising target of $60 billion, though actual proceeds could be higher. The company\u2019s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that OpenAI aims to go public by 2027, though some advisors predict an earlier timeline, possibly by the end of 2026. However, an OpenAI spokesperson stated, 'IPO is not our current priority, so we cannot set a timeline,' emphasizing the company\u2019s focus on building a sustainable, long-term business to fulfill its mission of ensuring everyone benefits from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The restructuring aims to reduce reliance on Microsoft and enhance capital-raising efficiency, enabling larger acquisitions to support Sam Altman\u2019s trillion-dollar AI infrastructure investment plan. OpenAI, currently valued at $500 billion, is experiencing user growth, with annualized revenue projected to reach $20 billion by year-end, despite expanding losses. Altman himself acknowledged in a live stream on October 28 that an IPO is 'the most likely option' given future funding needs. The broader AI-driven market surge is evident, with cloud provider CoreWeave's IPO reaching a $23 billion valuation and its stock rising over 300%, while NVIDIA has become the world\u2019s first company to surpass a $5 trillion market cap, solidifying its central role in the global AI boom.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 05:38 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://finance.technews.tw/2025/10/30/openai-is-laying-the-groundwork-for-an-initial-public-offering/)\n\n**OpenAI Lays Groundwork For Juggernaut IPO at Up To $1 Trillion Valuation**\nOpenAI is preparing for a potential initial public offering (IPO) that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, according to three people familiar with the matter, making it one of the largest IPOs in history. The company is considering filing with securities regulators as early as the second half of 2026, with plans to raise at least $60 billion\u2014though figures and timing remain fluid based on business performance and market conditions. CFO Sarah Friar has indicated a 2027 listing as a target, though some advisers suggest an earlier date around late 2026. An OpenAI spokesperson stated, 'An IPO is not our focus, so we could not possibly have set a date,' emphasizing the company\u2019s mission to build a durable business and advance artificial general intelligence (AGI) for public benefit. The IPO preparations follow a major restructuring that reduces OpenAI\u2019s reliance on Microsoft, which now owns approximately 27% of the company after a $13 billion investment. The nonprofit OpenAI Foundation now holds a 26% stake in OpenAI Group and a warrant for additional shares upon achieving specific milestones, making it a key financial stakeholder. The move reflects growing urgency to access public markets for efficient capital raising and to fund CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plans to invest trillions into AI infrastructure. OpenAI\u2019s annualized revenue run rate is expected to reach $20 billion by year-end, though losses are increasing within the $500 billion company. Altman acknowledged the IPO as the 'most likely path' due to substantial capital needs. This development follows a surge in AI-driven market enthusiasm, highlighted by CoreWeave\u2019s $23 billion IPO (now tripled in value) and Nvidia\u2019s $5 trillion market cap, cementing its central role in the global AI boom.

This would support CEO Sam Altman\u2019s plan to invest trillions in AI infrastructure. The sources also noted that OpenAI\u2019s annual revenue is expected to reach approximately $20 billion (NT$613.9 billion) by year-end, despite rising internal losses at the $500 billion (NT$15.34 trillion) valuation company.

    "summary": "All eight forecasting experts independently assess the probability of OpenAI filing a public, non-confidential S-1 statement with the SEC before December 15, 2025, to be extremely low. Across diverse specializations (investment banking, corporate law, technology industry analysis, finance, and business strategy), the consensus is grounded in several key factors: (1) explicit and repeated denials from OpenAI's CFO and executives regarding any immediate IPO plans; (2) credible media reporting and leaks consistently referencing a target IPO timeline of late 2026 or 2027; (3) recent organizational restructuring that, while enabling IPO readiness, suggests medium- rather than near-term intentions; (4) ongoing pursuit of alternative financing avenues (private funding, government-backed loans, partnerships), indicating no urgent need for public capital; and (5) historical base rates and operational realities, which show mega-IPOs of this scale are typically telegraphed and prepared over years, not weeks or months. The only scenario in which a filing might happen would require an unpredictable, acute need for capital or a sudden strategic shift, with no evidence currently supporting such developments. Final probability estimates from all experts cluster between 1-5%, with most at the lower end. All agree the status quo\u2014no S-1 filing before the deadline\u2014is overwhelmingly likely absent an extraordinary external shock.",
