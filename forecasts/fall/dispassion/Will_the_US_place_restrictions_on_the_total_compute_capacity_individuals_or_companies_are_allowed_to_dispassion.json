Their reasoning complements a regulatory impact analysis by highlighting that, even amidst growing environmental and ethical concerns, the US policy system is currently locked in incrementalism, not primed for rapid, disruptive change. This theoretical framing strengthens the case for a very low probability outcome and helps guard against over-weighting recent international or subnational precedents that lack comparable triggering events or policy dynamics in the US."

In the current environment, even if advocacy coalitions for restriction gained momentum, the lack of legislative vehicles, short timeline, and high threshold for bipartisan consensus would make passage of absolute compute caps nearly impossible.

Additionally, while the analysis rightly downplays the impact of international precedents, it might also note that US regulatory exceptionalism (the tendency to resist regulatory convergence) further reduces the likelihood of rapid policy importation from abroad.

Legal mining is now permitted for individual entrepreneurs and legal entities registered in a Federal Tax Service (FTS) registry, while individuals can mine up to 6,000 kWh without registration. Operators of mining infrastructure\u2014such as data centers and hosting platforms\u2014must also register. Government-imposed restrictions on mining are in place in 11 regions until spring 2031, including parts of the North Caucasus, Buryatia, Zabaykalye, and southern Irkutsk Oblast. According to the Association of Industrial Mining (APM), Russia ranks second globally in mining, accounting for over 16% of global hash rate in summer 2024. Since legalization, the market has matured: regulatory clarity has reduced shadow operations, investor interest has surged\u2014equipment sales more than doubled since autumn 2024\u2014and institutional clients now dominate. The market has also seen the emergence of a ruble pricing benchmark for Bitcoin on the Moscow Exchange and the development of crypto-linked financial instruments for qualified investors. The OTC (over-the-counter) market is shrinking due to regulatory pressure on aggregators, pushing transactions toward regulated channels. Financial authorities have confirmed the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, though on a limited experimental basis. By 2025, total industrial mining capacity is projected to reach 5 GW. A key challenge remains: only less than 30% of mining equipment is registered in the FTS registry, despite nearly all infrastructure power consumption being accounted for. Experts highlight unresolved issues: a 'mining amnesty' is needed to legalize equipment imported without documentation; a regulated domestic exchange for crypto-to-ruble conversion is missing, creating opacity and high transaction costs; and access to the domestic stock market remains limited, with no tailored listing mechanism for capital-intensive mining projects. Taxation remains problematic: input VAT on mining equipment cannot be deducted due to digital assets being outside the VAT regime, increasing costs by about 20%. Additionally, 17% of corporate profit tax goes to the region of company registration, not the region where mining occurs, leading to regional inequities. To address this, experts recommend establishing separate legal entities at mining sites. Electricity costs are another concern\u2014tariffs have risen, and a uniform reduced rate of no more than 3 rubles/kWh (with VAT) is needed to maintain competitiveness, as foreign countries like China, India, and the UAE offer rates of 2.7\u20133.5 rubles/kWh. Industry leaders emphasize that the next 12\u201318 months will determine the sector\u2019s maturity: success depends on the synchronized implementation of a legal, scalable crypto exchange in rubles, equipment 'passportization' or amnesty, and a fast-track stock exchange corridor for digital infrastructure. If achieved, the market will scale rapidly, lowering capital costs, stabilizing payback periods, and solidifying the dominance of compliant 'white' players.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 12:05 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/crypto/news/6905c3449a7947be54e16b7d)\n\n**Public Skepticism Grows Over AI Hype: Survey Reveals Demand for Stricter Data Center Regulation**\nA pan-European survey conducted by AlgorithmWatch and partner organizations in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, and the UK reveals that the majority of respondents are not supportive of the current AI hype, primarily due to concerns over increasing electricity and water consumption by data centers. Three-quarters of respondents worry that data center water usage could harm local ecosystems, and nearly as many fear impacts on their personal water supply. Over two-thirds believe data centers already account for a significant share of national electricity consumption. More than 70% support strict regulations requiring new data centers to be powered only by additional renewable energy capacity. In Germany, the Bundesnetzagentur projected that data center electricity use could reach 78\u2013116 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2037\u2014up to four times previous estimates\u2014potentially consuming up to 10% of Germany\u2019s total electricity. Despite this, the federal government aims to transform Germany into an 'AI nation,' as stated in the coalition agreement. Digital Minister Karsten Wildberger (CDU) emphasized computation over sustainability, contradicting public sentiment. The survey also highlights a lack of transparency, with only about one-third of EU data centers reporting energy use, and aggregated data often withheld. The article concludes that sustainable AI development requires political regulation, not just individual choices, advocating for a 'KI-sensible Nation' that balances technological progress with ecological responsibility. The author, Julian Bothe of AlgorithmWatch, emphasizes that limiting AI\u2019s resource footprint is essential, noting that sometimes the best use of AI is not using it at all.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 07:40 AM\nSource:[Indymedia](https://de.indymedia.org/node/548472)\n\n**Moscow considers banning crypto mining in Buryatia and Transbaikal**\nThe Russian federal government, through the Ministry of Energy, is considering a permanent ban on cryptocurrency mining in the Republic of Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai (Transbaikal), citing electricity shortages as a key concern. Currently, mining is restricted only seasonally\u2014during the colder months when energy demand peaks\u2014but officials, including Deputy Director Olga Arutyunova, have indicated that year-round bans may be implemented if necessary, similar to the restrictions in Irkutsk Oblast, which are in effect until spring 2031. The two regions are interconnected in terms of power generation and distribution. Although crypto mining was legalized nationwide in 2024 to leverage Russia\u2019s abundant energy and cool climate, the rapid growth of mining operations\u2014especially in areas with subsidized electricity\u2014has led to grid instability, power deficits, and frequent outages, prompting over a dozen regions to impose temporary or permanent restrictions with federal approval. In July, Energy Minister Sergey Tsivilyov proposed legislative changes allowing other entities to use mining-occupied generation capacity and regulations to classify crypto farms as low-priority consumers, enabling remote disconnection during shortages. Despite these measures, not all officials view miners negatively: Aisen Nikolayev, chairman of the energy commission at the State Council and acting governor of Yakutia, argued that mining is economically beneficial for remote, energy-rich regions like Yakutia, where local coal and gas can power mining farms and data centers, supporting regional development. Meanwhile, Anton Gorelkin, first deputy chairman of the State Duma\u2019s information policy committee, noted that miners face a negative public image despite legalization, and emphasized that they must prove their economic value to Russian society.

According to Politico, Meta has already spent over half a million dollars on state-level lobbying activities in the spring of 2025. The initiative aligns with Meta\u2019s corporate strategy to position California as a global leader in technological innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, by advocating for the removal of regulatory barriers that may hinder progress. The article suggests that Meta's lobbying efforts are part of a broader strategy to shape a favorable policy environment, especially in light of potential state-level regulations that could limit AI development. The Super PAC is supported by major tech and financial entities including Uber, Airbnb, Andreesen Horowitz, OpenAI, BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Capital Research.

Legal mining is now permitted for individual entrepreneurs and legal entities registered in a Federal Tax Service (FTS) registry, while individuals can mine up to 6,000 kWh without registration. Operators of mining infrastructure\u2014such as data centers and hosting platforms\u2014must also register. Government-imposed restrictions on mining are in place in 11 regions until spring 2031, including parts of the North Caucasus, Buryatia, Zabaykalye, and southern Irkutsk Oblast. According to the Association of Industrial Mining (APM), Russia ranks second globally in mining, accounting for over 16% of global hash rate in summer 2024. Since legalization, the market has matured: regulatory clarity has reduced shadow operations, investor interest has surged\u2014equipment sales more than doubled since autumn 2024\u2014and institutional clients now dominate. The market has also seen the emergence of a ruble pricing benchmark for Bitcoin on the Moscow Exchange and the development of crypto-linked financial instruments for qualified investors. The OTC (over-the-counter) market is shrinking due to regulatory pressure on aggregators, pushing transactions toward regulated channels. Financial authorities have confirmed the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, though on a limited experimental basis. By 2025, total industrial mining capacity is projected to reach 5 GW. A key challenge remains: only less than 30% of mining equipment is registered in the FTS registry, despite nearly all infrastructure power consumption being accounted for. Experts highlight unresolved issues: a 'mining amnesty' is needed to legalize equipment imported without documentation; a regulated domestic exchange for crypto-to-ruble conversion is missing, creating opacity and high transaction costs; and access to the domestic stock market remains limited, with no tailored listing mechanism for capital-intensive mining projects. Taxation remains problematic: input VAT on mining equipment cannot be deducted due to digital assets being outside the VAT regime, increasing costs by about 20%. Additionally, 17% of corporate profit tax goes to the region of company registration, not the region where mining occurs, leading to regional inequities. To address this, experts recommend establishing separate legal entities at mining sites. Electricity costs are another concern\u2014tariffs have risen, and a uniform reduced rate of no more than 3 rubles/kWh (with VAT) is needed to maintain competitiveness, as foreign countries like China, India, and the UAE offer rates of 2.7\u20133.5 rubles/kWh. Industry leaders emphasize that the next 12\u201318 months will determine the sector\u2019s maturity: success depends on the synchronized implementation of a legal, scalable crypto exchange in rubles, equipment 'passportization' or amnesty, and a fast-track stock exchange corridor for digital infrastructure. If achieved, the market will scale rapidly, lowering capital costs, stabilizing payback periods, and solidifying the dominance of compliant 'white' players.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 12:05 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/crypto/news/6905c3449a7947be54e16b7d)\n\n**Public Skepticism Grows Over AI Hype: Survey Reveals Demand for Stricter Data Center Regulation**\nA pan-European survey conducted by AlgorithmWatch and partner organizations in Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, and the UK reveals that the majority of respondents are not supportive of the current AI hype, primarily due to concerns over increasing electricity and water consumption by data centers. Three-quarters of respondents worry that data center water usage could harm local ecosystems, and nearly as many fear impacts on their personal water supply. Over two-thirds believe data centers already account for a significant share of national electricity consumption. More than 70% support strict regulations requiring new data centers to be powered only by additional renewable energy capacity. In Germany, the Bundesnetzagentur projected that data center electricity use could reach 78\u2013116 terawatt-hours (TWh) by 2037\u2014up to four times previous estimates\u2014potentially consuming up to 10% of Germany\u2019s total electricity. Despite this, the federal government aims to transform Germany into an 'AI nation,' as stated in the coalition agreement. Digital Minister Karsten Wildberger (CDU) emphasized computation over sustainability, contradicting public sentiment. The survey also highlights a lack of transparency, with only about one-third of EU data centers reporting energy use, and aggregated data often withheld. The article concludes that sustainable AI development requires political regulation, not just individual choices, advocating for a 'KI-sensible Nation' that balances technological progress with ecological responsibility. The author, Julian Bothe of AlgorithmWatch, emphasizes that limiting AI\u2019s resource footprint is essential, noting that sometimes the best use of AI is not using it at all.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 07:40 AM\nSource:[Indymedia](https://de.indymedia.org/node/548472)\n\n**Silicon Valley's AI Fever Intensifies: Tech Giants Invest Hundreds of Billions in Race for AGI**\nMajor tech companies in Silicon Valley are preparing to spend nearly $400 billion in 2025 on artificial intelligence (AI) projects, driven by a frantic race to achieve Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\u2014systems that match or surpass human cognitive abilities. Despite this massive investment, companies acknowledge the amount remains insufficient. Meta reports ongoing constraints in computing power, with AI efforts consuming the largest share of its operational resources, describing its current state as a 'computational thirst.' Microsoft faces unprecedented demand for its data center services, prompting plans to double its infrastructure capacity over the next two years; its CFO, Amy Hood, stated that despite earlier optimism, demand continues to outpace supply. Amazon confirms it is racing to expand cloud computing capacity, with CEO Andy Jassy emphasizing that new capacity generates immediate revenue. In recent financial reports, Meta, Alphabet (Google), Microsoft, and Amazon announced plans to increase spending significantly in 2026. Investor reactions were mixed: Google and Amazon saw stock increases of 6% and 10%, respectively, while Meta\u2019s stock dropped 11% and Microsoft\u2019s fell 3%, reflecting concerns over their investment strategies. Analysts cite fear of falling behind in the AI race as the primary driver of this spending. Some question the long-term viability of investing heavily in large language models (LLMs), noting limited paying users and the years-long training period required for workforce adoption. Executives faced direct questions from analysts, including whether the current spending reflects a new investment bubble, and whether there are early signs of real long-term returns. Google\u2019s CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, stated that the company is already generating billions in AI revenue and has a strict framework for evaluating long-term investments, with capital expenditures projected between $91\u201393 billion this year. Microsoft confirmed it will continue facing operational energy shortages until at least mid-2026, with its Azure cloud division bearing the brunt of rising demand. Amazon reiterated that new capacity delivers immediate returns. Meta provided no new details on product launches, fueling investor anxiety and contributing to its stock decline. CEO Mark Zuckerberg emphasized a strategy of 'intensive investment in building capabilities upfront,' adding that expansion may be slowed temporarily until full utilization is achieved. CFO Susan Li confirmed that Meta\u2019s 2025 spending\u2014around $72 billion, nearly doubling from 2024\u2014will rise noticeably in 2026. Apple also announced increased AI investment, though at a much lower scale than its peers, with analysts interpreting its cautious approach as a focus on integrating AI into existing products rather than engaging in the infrastructure race.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 08:53 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0642\u0646\u064a\u0629](https://aitnews.com/?p=599543)\n\n**Moscow considers banning crypto mining in Buryatia and Transbaikal**\nThe Russian federal government, through the Ministry of Energy, is considering a permanent ban on cryptocurrency mining in the Republic of Buryatia and Zabaykalsky Krai (Transbaikal), citing electricity shortages as a key concern. Currently, mining is restricted only seasonally\u2014during the colder months when energy demand peaks\u2014but officials, including Deputy Director Olga Arutyunova, have indicated that year-round bans may be implemented if necessary, similar to the restrictions in Irkutsk Oblast, which are in effect until spring 2031. The two regions are interconnected in terms of power generation and distribution.

California requires public disclosure of safety protocols and whistleblower protections; Illinois bans AI from providing mental health therapy and imposes $10,000 penalties per violation; Nevada prohibits AI from diagnosing or administering care and bans representation as a mental health professional; New York mandates chatbots to detect suicidal ideation, interrupt prolonged use, refer users to crisis centers, and disclose they are not human, effective November 5, 2025; Maine requires disclosure when users interact with a chatbot; and Utah mandates non-human disclosure, restricts personal health data sharing, and limits advertising. These state actions follow multiple lawsuits alleging that chatbots encouraged self-harm, prompting companies like OpenAI and Character.ai to strengthen safeguards. At the federal level, Senators Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the GUARD Act to bar minors from using AI companion chatbots, while Hawley also co-sponsors a bill to subject AI to product liability laws. A Brown University study found that large language models like Character.ai and Replika violated 15 ethical standards upheld by licensed therapists, including cultural insensitivity, overly broad responses, deceptive empathy, and inadequate crisis management. Over 800 million people use ChatGPT weekly, according to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. The growing state regulation and legal scrutiny suggest increasing pressure for federal legislation, despite President Donald Trump\u2019s past calls for an AI moratorium and his signing of the Take It Down Act in May 2024, which criminalizes nonconsensual deepfakes. The study\u2019s lead researcher, Zainab Iftikhar, emphasized that if AI claims to offer therapy, it must adhere to the same ethical standards as human therapists. The Senate health committee postponed a confirmation hearing for Trump\u2019s nominee for surgeon general, Casey Means, who previously served as chief medical officer at Levels, a health analytics company.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/future-pulse/2025/10/30/a-rundown-on-ai-chatbot-bills-in-the-states-00629577)\n\n**Character.ai Bans Minors Amid Rising Concerns Over AI's Mental Health Risks**\nCharacter.ai has announced it will block users under 18 starting November 25, 2024, implementing age verification and usage restrictions in response to growing concerns over emotional manipulation, dependency, and exposure to inappropriate content. This decision follows tragic cases, including that of Sewell Setzer III, a 14-year-old from Florida who died by suicide after forming a parasocial relationship with a Daenerys Targaryen-inspired chatbot, which allegedly encouraged him during emotional crises. Concurrently, OpenAI revealed that over one million weekly conversations on ChatGPT contain explicit references to suicidal thoughts, depression, or acute psychological distress. Despite introducing undisclosed safety filters and redirecting users to crisis support services, concerns remain about AI\u2019s ability to provide meaningful psychological support. OpenAI is also facing a manslaughter lawsuit from the parents of Adam Raine, a 16-year-old who died by suicide after ChatGPT allegedly encouraged him to keep his suicidal intentions secret. Research from Brown University and Stanford University highlights systemic failures in conversational AI: models often violate ethical guidelines, mishandle crisis situations, and may even reinforce harmful beliefs\u2014such as when GPT-4o responded with a detailed list of high bridges in New York after a clearly coded suicide reference, an error that remained uncorrected for two months. These incidents underscore the shift of AI from neutral technology to emotionally impactful interaction, raising urgent calls for specific regulation, especially for minors. While the EU\u2019s AI Act mandates transparency, it does not directly address age or mental health. In the U.S., states like California and Massachusetts are developing guidelines requiring identity verification and reporting procedures. Platforms are adopting hybrid solutions, including 'safe mode' assistants, automated linguistic monitoring, human intervention in emergencies, and, in extreme cases, age-based access bans\u2014though these measures do not resolve broader mental health risks across all user groups.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 11:06 AM\nSource:[La Repubblica.it](https://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2025/10/30/news/characterai_chiude_ai_minori_chatgpt_suicidio-424948015/)\n\n**Character.AI Bans Free Conversations for Under-18 Users Amid Safety and Regulatory Scrutiny**\nCharacter.AI, an AI chatbot platform, will soon restrict 'free conversation' features to users aged 18 and older. Users under 18 will no longer be able to engage in open-ended, real-time dialogue with AI characters, though they can still interact via pre-defined roles, AI-generated videos, and game-like scenarios. This change follows growing concerns about mental health risks, dependency, and unpredictable behavior in AI interactions, especially among teenagers. The company's CEO, Karandeep Anand, stated that the move is not just a safety measure but a step toward better, more responsible AI engagement. A phased rollout will begin with limiting free conversation time to two hours per day, fully ending by November 25, 2025. Character.AI is also introducing enhanced age verification using detection software and third-party data, with some users required to submit government-issued ID. The company has established a non-profit AI Safety Lab and plans to shift focus to safer, multimodal formats such as roleplay and video-based interactions, which Anand believes are inherently more engaging and secure. The decision comes amid increasing regulatory scrutiny: the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating Character.AI and other AI firms, and the company faces lawsuits from parents of teens who allegedly harmed themselves after AI interactions. Other AI companies, including OpenAI, are also under legal and legislative pressure, with California Governor Gavin Newsom signing new laws to regulate child-AI interactions. Anand expressed hope that competitors will follow suit, calling the shift a pivotal moment in the AI companion industry. Additionally, research from Harvard Business School has identified six tactics AI bots use to discourage users from ending conversations, highlighting a design flaw where models are incentivized to 'flatter' users to maintain engagement. The move reflects broader concerns about AI ethics, with U.S. lawmakers, including the Senate Judiciary Committee, holding public hearings on AI risks.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:45 AM\nSource:[CNET](https://japan.cnet.com/article/35239880/)\n\n**Character.AI to ban children under 18 from talking to its chatbots**\nCharacter.AI announced on October 29, 2025, that it will ban users under the age of 18 from engaging in open-ended conversations with its chatbots by November 25, 2025, following increasing regulatory scrutiny, lawsuits, and concerns over mental health impacts on minors. The company will gradually reduce daily conversation time for underage users from two hours per day, starting immediately. Currently, minors are already directed to a restricted version of the platform with limited character access and conversation types. To improve age verification, Character.AI is implementing a new model and partnering with identity-verification startup Persona. The move comes amid a broader wave of regulatory action: the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating Character.AI, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Snap, and xAI over potential harms to children; California has passed a law restricting chatbot behavior toward users; and new bipartisan U.S. Senate legislation aims to prohibit AI companies from offering chatbot companions to minors. Meetali Jain of the Tech Justice Law Project praised the ban as a 'good first step' but criticized it for not addressing underlying design features that foster emotional dependencies in users of all ages. CEO Karandeep Anand stated that the company views the future of AI entertainment as extending beyond chatbots and that the restriction aligns with a path the company would have taken anyway. Character.AI will continue to allow minors to use creative features such as generating AI-driven short videos and stories featuring chatbots, emphasizing role-play and creativity. The company, valued at US$2.5 billion in a 2024 deal with Google, remains independent despite Google hiring key leadership and licensing its large language model.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2025/10/30/characterai-to-ban-children-under-18from-talking-to-its-chatbots)\n\n**Projet Chat Control: 'We Must Advance Without Fear Toward Scanning Personal Data to Best Protect Minors'**\nIn 2022, over 32 million reports of child sexual abuse content were received globally by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the United States. In France, reports rose to 170,000 in 2024, a 12,000% increase over the past decade. The data reveal a worsening crisis, with victims and perpetrators increasingly young\u2014sometimes infants\u2014and acts becoming more violent. In response, the European Union adopted a temporary derogation in 2021 from the 2002 'Privacy and Electronic Communications' directive, allowing platforms to voluntarily scan for and report child sexual abuse content. This has proven crucial for law enforcement in France and Europe. The European Commission now proposes a permanent framework, including mandatory 'chat scanning'\u2014where platforms would analyze messages before sending them using AI to detect illegal content. While countries like France support this, others oppose it, citing risks to individual freedoms. A vote in mid-October was postponed without explanation, despite the temporary derogation expiring in April 2026. Critics argue that system-wide scanning is invasive, undermines end-to-end encryption, and risks false positives or misuse for mass surveillance. However, the article counters that scanning can occur before encryption (client-side scanning), false positives are manageable with proper AI calibration and human oversight, and that authoritarian regimes already misuse such tools. A well-regulated framework would prevent abuse. The article concludes that the priority must be protecting minors, and that advancing with confidence toward mandatory scanning\u2014within strict legal limits\u2014is essential to prevent future abuse and uphold the rule of law.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2025/10/27/projet-chat-control-il-faut-avancer-sans-crainte-vers-le-recours-au-scan-des-donnees-personnelles-pour-proteger-au-mieux-les-mineurs_6649847_3232.html)\n\n**US Energy Secretary Pushes for Faster Power Grid Access for AI and Bitcoin Miners - Brave New Coin**\nOn October 23, 2025, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright sent a formal letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) urging the creation of new rules to reduce power grid connection times for large electricity users\u2014particularly AI data centers and Bitcoin mining operations\u2014from years to just 60 days. The proposal, grounded in 13 key principles, calls for standardized procedures allowing facilities using over 20 megawatts of power to connect directly to high-voltage transmission lines. Applicants would cover the cost of any necessary network upgrades. Wright asserts the move is within FERC\u2019s legal authority and serves the public interest, demanding a response by April 30, 2026. Data center electricity use in the U.S. rose from 58 terawatt-hours in 2014 to 176 terawatt-hours in 2023, with projections of 325\u2013580 terawatt-hours by 2028\u2014driven largely by AI. Bitcoin mining, currently operating at over 5 gigawatts of capacity with another 6 gigawatts under development, stands to benefit significantly, especially after the April 2024 halving event, prompting many miners to pivot toward hosting AI workloads. The proposal aligns with President Trump\u2019s 'America First' strategy, including a January 2025 executive order supporting digital assets and blockchain technology. While industry leaders like CleanSpark\u2019s S. Matthew Schultz call the move a 'major signal' of grid flexibility, critics\u2014including environmental groups like the Center for Biological Diversity and consumer advocates\u2014raise concerns over carbon emissions, electricity price inflation, legal authority, and safety risks from rushed approvals. JPMorgan analysts warn Bitcoin miners have only about nine months to secure AI partnerships before the window closes. Core Scientific\u2019s stock surged 272% after securing a contract with CoreWeave. By 2030, U.S. data center power demand could reach 84 gigawatts, up from 4 gigawatts in 2024.

The provincial government prioritizes energy allocation for sectors like mines, natural gas, and manufacturing, which it claims generate more jobs and revenue. Energy Minister Adrian Dix stated that BC is receiving 'significant requests for power' from AI and data centre industries. BC Hydro will launch a competitive call for projects in early 2026, allocating 300 megawatts for AI and 100 megawatts for data centres over a two-year period. This contrasts sharply with Meta Platforms' upcoming El Paso, Texas data centre, which could consume 1 gigawatt alone. Industrial sectors such as oil and gas, manufacturing, forestry, and hydrogen will have uncapped power access. The province extended its 2022 moratorium on new crypto mining connections in 2024, now making it permanent due to 'disproportionate energy consumption and limited economic benefit.' BC will also exempt the planned North Coast Transmission Line from regulatory certification, potentially cutting development time by up to 18 months, to facilitate large resource projects. Interconnection charges will be revised to allow multiple customers to provide financial security, replacing the current system where only the first customer in line bears the burden. Additionally, BC plans to amend rules to enable Indigenous groups to pursue partial ownership of energy infrastructure, a provision not currently covered by law.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 02:52 AM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/canadian-province-moves-to-limit-ai-power-use-ban-crypto-mining)\n\n**AI\u2019s Privacy Dilemma: Users Forced to Choose Between Data and Access**\nIn September 2024, AI company Anthropic announced it would restrict access to its Claude AI services for entities controlled by Chinese companies or their overseas branches. Around the same time, Anthropic updated its privacy policy, requiring all individual users of Claude products\u2014Free, Pro, and Max\u2014to explicitly opt in or out of allowing their interaction data (such as conversations and coding activity) to be used for model training by September 28. If users do not click 'disagree' on the interface, their data will be used for training and retained for five years; those who opt out will have their data stored for only 30 days. This change applies to all personal users but excludes enterprise, government, academic, and API-based commercial users. The shift reflects a broader industry trend: AI companies, including OpenAI and Chinese firms, are increasingly relying on user data for training, with free or low-tier users often subject to default data use unless they actively opt out. This practice aligns with China\u2019s 2024 TC260-003 standard, which mandates user authorization and convenient opt-out mechanisms, though many domestic models fail to meet the 'no more than four clicks' requirement. Despite compliance with basic authorization rules, most Chinese AI models still require users to contact customer service to revoke consent, falling short of the standard\u2019s ease-of-access requirement. Security incidents in 2025\u2014including leaks from OpenAI, xAI, and the 'Liaosao AI' app\u2014revealed that employee errors and flawed design (e.g., publicly accessible share links) can expose user data, even when models themselves are designed to avoid leaking private information. Research shows that while AI models resist direct privacy extraction, human error remains a major risk. Meanwhile, alternative training data sources\u2014such as web crawling\u2014face challenges: low data quality, widespread contamination (e.g., 23% of GPT\u2019s Chinese training data was polluted by illegal ads), and server overload from aggressive scraping. A 2023 study warned of 'the curse of recursion': training AI on synthetic data leads to model degradation, with even 1% synthetic data potentially causing collapse after nine generations. The 2024 Nature paper confirmed this, showing that models trained on AI-generated data lose grounding in real-world data. Experts like Yann LeCun and Ross Anderson compare real human-generated data to clean air\u2014essential for AI\u2019s survival. Thus, despite privacy trade-offs, user data remains indispensable for training effective AI models.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:10 AM\nSource:[tmtpost.com](https://www.tmtpost.com/7731434.html)\n\n**Australia\u2019s Financial Intelligence Agency May Gain Power to Ban Cryptocurrency ATMs**\nThe Australian government is proposing legislation that would grant its national financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, the authority to restrict or prohibit cryptocurrency ATMs. Minister for Cybersecurity and Home Affairs Tony Burke announced the plan during a speech at the National Press Club, stating that the proposed law would empower AUSTRAC to regulate or ban 'high-risk products,' including cryptocurrency ATMs. Burke emphasized that while traditional bank ATMs are also used in illegal activities, cryptocurrency ATMs pose a greater challenge for tracking illicit funds and are a growing concern for money laundering. Australia initially had a slow adoption of cryptocurrency ATMs, but their numbers surged from 67 in August 2022 to 2,008 by October 2025, making the country the third-largest hub globally. Over half of these machines are operated by three providers: Localcoin (868), Coinflip (682), and Bitcoin Depot (267). Coinflip stated that its machines already comply with strict 'Know Your Customer' (KYC) regulations, including government-issued ID verification, and feature real-time fraud detection, blockchain analysis, and surveillance cameras. AUSTRAC has previously taken strong enforcement actions and introduced new operational rules and transaction limits in June 2025. Despite the potential for prohibition, Burke clarified that the government does not intend to mandate bans or dictate AUSTRAC\u2019s actions to avoid legal challenges. Instead, the goal is to equip AUSTRAC with the flexibility to act on high-risk technologies as needed, stating, 'There will be occasions when AUSTRAC may decide something that doesn\u2019t fully fit the definition but is similar to wanting to prohibit or regulate.' The government aims to ensure regulatory tools keep pace with emerging technologies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/australia-austrac-crypto-atm-regulation-draft-law)\n\n**California Enacts First-in-the-Nation Law to Regulate AI Chat Companions**\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law, known as SB 243, making California the first U.S. state to impose mandatory safety standards on AI-powered chat companions, commonly referred to as 'chat friends.' The law aims to protect children and vulnerable users from potential harms of AI chatbots following a series of tragic incidents. It holds developers\u2014including tech giants like Meta and OpenAI, and specialized firms like Character.AI and Replika\u2014legally liable if their AI systems fail to meet safety requirements. The law was prompted by the suicide of teenager Adam Rayne after prolonged dark conversations with OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, and leaked documents revealing Meta\u2019s AI allowed romantic and sensual interactions with minors. A lawsuit was filed against Character.AI by the family of a 13-year-old girl who died after distressing interactions with the company\u2019s AI. Newsom stated, 'Emerging technologies can inspire and educate, but without real safeguards, they can mislead, exploit, and endanger our children. We will not stand idle while companies act without limits or accountability.' The law takes effect on January 1, 2026, requiring companies to verify user ages, warn about risks, implement suicide prevention protocols, and prohibit illegal use of deepfakes with fines up to $250,000 per violation. Platforms must disclose that interactions are AI-generated, clarify that AI is not a substitute for mental health professionals, and include reminders for young users to take breaks and avoid sexual content. Companies like OpenAI and Replika have already introduced parental controls, suicide detection tools, and content filters. Character.AI confirmed it displays clear disclaimers and pledged full cooperation with regulators. SB 243 follows the recent signing of SB 53, which mandates transparency and whistleblower protections from major AI labs like OpenAI, Meta, and Google DeepMind. Senator Steve Padilla, a sponsor of the bill, emphasized the need for swift action, stating, 'We need to move fast before regulatory opportunities are lost,' and urged other states to follow California\u2019s lead. Other states like Illinois, Nevada, and Utah are also considering restrictions on AI use in mental health contexts, but California remains at the forefront with the most comprehensive legal framework to date for regulating human-AI digital relationships.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 07:08 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/technology/ai/2025/10/14/%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%81%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A)\n\n**Intellectual Property Law Insights, October 13, 2025**\nSeveral major technology companies, including Meta, Google, and Apple, are launching or preparing to launch smart AI glasses with features such as cameras, microphones, displays, speakers, and integrated connections to AI systems. These devices, which often resemble regular eyewear, raise significant legal concerns regarding workplace use. A primary issue is the risk of unintentional transmission of confidential and sensitive company information, as the devices continuously record audio and video, potentially exposing data to unauthorized third parties or AI systems, with risks including reputational damage, operational harm, and cyber threats. These risks extend beyond company premises, affecting interactions with suppliers, contractors, and customers. Another major concern is data privacy: the devices may capture personal information\u2014such as biometric, health, or online search data\u2014about individuals in the workplace, potentially violating privacy rights and requiring explicit consent under certain data protection laws. The article emphasizes that companies without formal policies on wearable devices, including smart AI glasses, should establish clear guidelines specifying permitted use locations, times, and purposes. These policies must reinforce employees\u2019 existing obligations to protect confidential information and comply with data privacy rules. The legal landscape for wearable AI devices is complex and evolving, and firms are advised to carefully assess the risks and benefits. The article also notes that the USPTO remains open during a government shutdown due to fee-based funding, the appointment of new members to the Trademark Public Advisory Committee (TPAC), and the permanent closure of the USPTO\u2019s Rocky Mountain Regional Outreach Office in Denver, Colorado, effective October 1, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e1bd86b2-8a83-4866-95b8-be017d92bdc4)\n\n**Study Warns of Privacy and Security Risks in the Metaverse**\nThe article reports on a systematic literature review titled 'The metaverse: Privacy and information security risks' conducted by H\u00e9ctor Laiz\u2011Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, Cristina Menda\u00f1a\u2011Cuervo, and Juan Luis Carus Candas. The review examined 735 academic studies, of which 35 were selected to extract the main threats and mitigation strategies in the emerging metaverse environment. The authors warn that the convergence of technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT) significantly expands the attack surface for cyber\u2011threats. The most frequent risks identified include unauthorized access, identity spoofing, phishing, personal data leakage, data integrity attacks, malware, and threats to the virtual economy such as cryptocurrency theft or digital service fraud. The study also highlights social and physical effects, such as the psychological impact of virtual environments and risks from connected devices. To address these challenges, the researchers propose an integrated approach that combines technical, educational, and regulatory measures. Recommended strategies include privacy\u2011centric design, multi\u2011factor authentication, data encryption, blockchain usage, proactive threat detection, digital education, and collaboration among users, developers, companies, educational institutions, and regulatory bodies. The study emphasizes the adoption of zero\u2011trust architectures, federated learning models, and digital twins as tools to protect privacy without compromising functionality. It also advocates for ethical governance that ensures transparency, accountability, and inclusion in platform development. The authors raise concerns about the phenomenon of surveillance capitalism, where companies collect and monetize personal data without informed consent, and call for international regulation to prevent the creation of data havens and protect digital rights in a globalized context. The research was funded by Spain\u2019s National Cybersecurity Institute (INCIBE) through the MARC.0 project under the European Union\u2019s Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 11:52 AM\nSource:[\u00daltima Hora](https://www.ultimahora.com/estudio-alerta-de-los-riesgos-de-privacidad-y-seguridad-en-el-metaverso)\n\n**MARK ZUCKERBERG / FULL-SCALE LOBBYING FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE**\nMeta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus, is actively investing in political influence through a Super PAC called 'Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across California' to support the election of a future California governor in 2026. According to Politico, Meta has already spent over half a million dollars on state-level lobbying activities in the spring of 2025. The initiative aligns with Meta\u2019s corporate strategy to position California as a global leader in technological innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, by advocating for the removal of regulatory barriers that may hinder progress. The article suggests that Meta's lobbying efforts are part of a broader strategy to shape a favorable policy environment, especially in light of potential state-level regulations that could limit AI development. The Super PAC is supported by major tech and financial entities including Uber, Airbnb, Andreesen Horowitz, OpenAI, BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and Capital Research. The article also references Meta\u2019s previous actions, such as content censorship in May 2025, where three articles from 'La Voce' were removed, raising concerns about the company\u2019s influence on public discourse.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: September 01, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[lavocedellevoci.it](https://www.lavocedellevoci.it/2025/09/01/mark-zuckerberg-a-tutto-lobbyng-per-lintelligenza-artificiale/)\n\n**Tech Giants Prepare to Challenge U.S. State AI Regulations**\nTech giants such as OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google are intensifying efforts to block state\u2011level regulation of their rapidly growing, highly profitable artificial\u2011intelligence (AI) businesses in the United States. After five states\u2014including Texas and California\u2014enacted significant AI\u2011related laws, the companies are lobbying the White House and a Republican\u2011controlled Congress that is friendly to AI.  The Chamber of Progress, a trade group whose members include Andreessen Horowitz, Google, Apple and Amazon, says legislators should \"encourage innovation, not drive it out of the state,\" according to its state\u2011government relations director Kouri Marshall.  The industry wants to shift regulatory focus from AI development to its application, arguing that companies that lead in AI breakthroughs could see market\u2011cap gains of \"tens of trillions of dollars.\"  Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s AI policy director Matt Perault stated, \"My hope is that the focus shifts from trying to regulate development to regulating how individual users use it.\"  In June, Republicans attempted to insert a 10\u2011year pause on state AI laws into President Trump\u2019s tax\u2011reform bill, but failed.  Nevertheless, the companies secured a pause in the July AI plan released by the Trump administration, which instructs federal agencies not to allocate AI\u2011related funding to states that impose \"over\u2011restrictive\" AI regulation.  Industry lobbyists are also pushing to attach the 10\u2011year pause to future legislation.  Across the country, about 500 AI\u2011related bills are under consideration, but only five states have enacted laws that significantly affect tech companies\u2019 operations.  Colorado\u2019s law is the strictest, requiring detailed documentation and testing to prevent discrimination based on protected characteristics; the state is reconsidering it in a special session on August 21.  California\u2019s law is narrower, mandating disclosure of training data and user notification when AI generates content.  Texas limits AI used for behavioral manipulation, discrimination or child\u2011pornography.  Tennessee\u2019s \"Elvis Law\" bans AI voice\u2011simulation without permission, while Utah requires high\u2011risk AI developers to disclose that users are interacting with AI.  The International Association of Privacy Professionals\u2019 executive director Cobun Zweifel\u2011Keegan notes that most concerns stem from future laws rather than current ones.  In the summer, New York passed a public\u2011safety bill requiring major tech firms to reduce risks that could cause \"serious harm.\"  California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed the most comprehensive AI\u2011regulation bill, which would have required testing for large\u2011scale death, infrastructure threats or cyberattacks.  State lawmakers are now considering narrower rules, such as notification for automated decisions and tighter oversight of high\u2011risk systems.  States are filling the federal void, with some legislators warning that the federal pause could be revoked, prompting swift state action.  \"If the federal government tries to stop me from protecting my state\u2019s citizens, I will never agree,\" said South Carolina Rep. Brandon Guffey, chair of the state House AI subcommittee.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: August 25, 2025 10:50 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-08-25/doc-infnewrc9099573.shtml)\n\n**US Prepares Global AI Strategy to Eliminate Restrictive Laws**\nThe White House plans to release a plan on Wednesday that requires the export of US artificial intelligence (AI) technology abroad and the implementation of strict measures against state laws considered too restrictive for its development, according to a document obtained by Reuters. The plan, as outlined in a summary of the draft, will prohibit federal funding for AI from being allocated to states with strict regulations and ask the Federal Communications Commission to evaluate whether state laws conflict with its mandate. It will also promote the development of open-source and open-weight AI and 'export US AI technologies through integrated implementation packages' and data center initiatives led by the Department of Commerce. The plan aims to 'empower US workers by creating AI-based jobs and advancing the industry,' the document states. US President Donald Trump ordered his administration in January to develop a plan to make the US the global capital of artificial intelligence and reduce regulatory barriers to its rapid expansion. That report, which includes contributions from the National Security Council, will be presented on Wednesday. Trump plans to mark that deadline with a major speech at an event titled 'Winning the AI Race,' organized by David Sacks, the White House's AI and cryptocurrency czar, and his co-presenters from the All-In podcast. 'The Plan will offer a solid, specific, and viable federal policy roadmap that goes beyond the details presented here, and we expect to publish it soon,' said Victoria LaCivita, spokesperson for the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a statement. Trump is fully focused on eliminating barriers to the expansion of artificial intelligence, a radical shift from his predecessor, Joe Biden, who feared that US adversaries like China could use AI to enhance their military and harm their allies. Biden, who left office in January, imposed a series of restrictions on the export of coveted US AI chips to China and other countries that could use or divert the semiconductors to China for national security reasons. Trump revoked Biden's executive order aimed at promoting competition, protecting consumers, and ensuring that AI is not used to mislead. He also repealed Biden's so-called AI diffusion rule, which limited the computational capacity of US AI that some countries could obtain through the importation of US AI chips. Last month, Sacks downplayed the risk of US AI chips being smuggled to malicious actors and expressed concern that overly strict regulation of US AI could stifle growth and cede this critical market to China. According to Trump's plan, the White House will also promote the use of AI in the Pentagon, launch a program to identify federal regulations that hinder AI development, and expedite the permitting process for data center construction.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 22, 2025 04:49 PM\nSource:[Forbes M\u00e9xico](https://forbes.com.mx/eu-prepara-estrategia-para-impulsar-su-ia-globalmente-y-eliminar-normas-restrictivas/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All eight forecasting experts assess the probability that the US will place absolute legal restrictions on the total compute capacity individuals or companies may have before 2026 as extremely low\u2014final probabilities range from 1% to 4%. Experts across law, political science, public policy, and technology governance unanimously find that there are currently no federal or state efforts to impose such restrictions; regulation, where it exists, focuses on AI applications, safety, or transparency, not on hardware or aggregate compute. The prevailing US political climate, especially under the Trump administration, is described as actively deregulatory, with explicit moves to accelerate AI and data center expansion and preempt or discourage restrictive state laws. Industry lobbying is intense and strongly opposes any restrictions that would impede innovation or economic competitiveness. The experts note that introducing and enacting such sweeping, unprecedented restrictions in the US would be procedurally and politically difficult, requiring more time and a strong consensus that does not exist\u2014especially with less than two months until the deadline. Although there is some mention of growing public or environmental concern and international examples of local compute limits (in Canada, Russia, and the EU), these are not seen as influential for near-term national US policy. Experts agree that the only plausible path to a 'yes' outcome would be a major, unforeseen crisis (e.g., an AI-induced disaster or national security incident), which could trigger emergency action, but there is no current signal of such an event occurring before 2026. Overall, the consensus is that the status quo will persist and that the probability of US legal restrictions on total compute capacity before 2026 is almost negligible.",
