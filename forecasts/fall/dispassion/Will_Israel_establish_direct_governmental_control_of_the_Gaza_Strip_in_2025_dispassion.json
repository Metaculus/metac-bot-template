While Israeli domestic politics introduce some tail risk, with right-wing coalition partners advocating for maximalist solutions, the obstacles\u2014international opposition, military overstretch, and lack of U.S. support\u2014are formidable. Base rates for similar postwar occupations in the region (Lebanon 1982, Gaza 1967-1994, post-2007 Gaza blockade) show strong Israeli preference for indirect control. The resolution criteria are strict: only a formal government, not mere military occupation, counts.

The current diplomatic environment\u2014with heavy U.S., regional, and international pressure for an internationally supervised or Palestinian-led postwar arrangement, and with Israel already facing severe isolation and economic strain\u2014makes formal governmental control deeply unattractive. Even Netanyahu's maximalist rhetoric has not translated into irreversible administrative moves in Gaza, and Israeli strategic culture since 2005 has been to avoid the occupation 'trap.' The only plausible pathways toward a 'Yes' outcome require a collapse of all alternatives and/or a dramatic shift in Israeli politics, neither of which is strongly evidenced in the latest reporting. The humanitarian, logistical, and political costs, as well as the lack of a clear operational benefit, further lower the plausibility. Summing up: while not strictly impossible, a 'Yes' outcome is highly improbable barring black swan events, and the status quo plus international constraints dominate.",

This aligns closely with historical patterns, such as Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon and Gaza, and the ongoing use of the Palestinian Authority as a buffer in the West Bank. The forecast also astutely notes that even in the face of right-wing domestic pressure, the operational and reputational costs of direct rule are prohibitive\u2014especially given the scale of destruction in Gaza and the high risk of insurgency. Where this analysis excels, from my diplomatic perspective, is in its understanding that formal governmental establishment is not merely a military or security decision but a deeply political one that would trigger severe international backlash and far-reaching legal consequences. The emphasis on the distinction between de facto military occupation and de jure governmental control is crucial for interpreting the resolution criteria.

While the forecast is right to emphasize legal and diplomatic obstacles, it may underweight the destabilizing potential of internal Israeli politics (e.g., a collapse of coalition constraints, or a dramatic security event) or a total breakdown of international transitional plans. From the perspective of peace process mediation, the threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is high\u2014but not unreachable should all alternatives collapse.

Critiques and defenses have focused on whether the probability should be slightly higher to account for tail risks (catastrophic collapse of alternatives, acute crisis, or political shock in Israel), with most estimates clustering around the 6-10% range. There is general agreement that while a 'Yes' outcome is not impossible, it would require a dramatic and presently unindicated shift.

However, there is no compelling new evidence or argument indicating an imminent shift in Israeli policy or preparations for formal governmental control.

These are valid points; while my initial 4% already reflects a nonzero tail risk, I see merit in nudging slightly higher to better capture the unpredictable volatility of the situation, as argued by some group members.

President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war in Gaza, secure the release of all living Israeli hostages, and halt destruction in the territory have sparked hopes for broader regional transformation, despite ongoing uncertainty about sustainability. While Arab governments may consider normalization with Israel if Trump\u2019s plan prevents Palestinian displacement and Israeli annexation of the West Bank, Israeli leaders view Arab pressure on Hamas to accept the deal as evidence of renewed interest in normalization. However, Mark Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, argues in a Foreign Affairs analysis that even if the Gaza agreement holds, the moment of U.S.-Israel alignment will not last. Israel\u2019s mistaken belief in a permanent strategic superiority over regional powers will likely lead it to continue provocative actions directly challenging U.S. objectives. Gulf states, which Israel seeks to win over, now doubt both Israel\u2019s willingness and ability to protect their core interests. These countries are less focused on countering Iran and less convinced that Washington\u2019s door opens through Tel Aviv. Moreover, Israel appears unaware of the depth of Trump\u2019s growing ties with Gulf states. Israeli leadership, driven by wishful thinking and a powerful security establishment, has exploited its overwhelming military force since Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 attack\u2014destroying Gaza entirely, crossing long-standing red lines, assassinating high-profile figures such as Hezbollah\u2019s Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas\u2019s Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Iranian military leaders in Syria, and Yemen\u2019s Houthi prime minister. Israel\u2019s attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear and military sites marked its resolve to strike at its greatest enemy. The failed attempt to assassinate Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, was a turning point. Trump reportedly reacted with visible displeasure as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu read a written apology to the Emir of Qatar, symbolizing a geopolitical shift that led to the Gaza ceasefire, according to Lynch. However, it remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s anger will lead to meaningful changes beyond the current ceasefire. U.S. analyst Alexander Langlois asserts that the so-called 'ceasefire' in Gaza no longer exists in practice, as Israel resumed full military operations against Hamas on October 28, 2024, effectively nullifying any real meaning of the truce. Lynch urges Israel to retreat from the brink, seize the opportunity presented by the ceasefire to reduce military adventurism, and pursue a sustainable regional order\u2014only achievable through serious movement toward a Palestinian state. The prolonged conflict has exposed Israel\u2019s vulnerabilities: its missile defenses are not foolproof, its economy cannot sustain endless war, its internal politics are strained, and its military remains heavily dependent on the U.S. The Gaza war has eroded Israel\u2019s global standing, leaving it increasingly isolated and alone. President Isaac Herzog warned of rising levels of incitement and violence in Israel, comparable to those preceding the assassination of former PM Yitzhak Rabin. The region\u2019s new order cannot be imposed by Israel through military force alone. Leadership requires not just military dominance but also regional acceptance and cooperation. No Middle Eastern power wants Israeli leadership, and all now fear Israel\u2019s aggressive power. While some in Washington welcome Israel\u2019s destruction of U.S. adversaries, they must exercise caution: Israel\u2019s interests diverge from U.S. interests. Israel writes many checks and expects the U.S. to pay, but Washington may not want or be able to honor them. Israel\u2019s attempts to reshape the region have exceeded imagination and swim against the current. The Middle East\u2019s regional order had remained remarkably stable for 35 years, despite ongoing violence, with only brief moments of potential change that did not last. The structure consists of a non-popular, unpopular U.S. hegemony opposing a strong regional divide into two rival blocs. U.S. dominance, weakened by the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2008 financial crisis, is no longer as solid as in past decades. Multipolarity remains distant. Russia had only one regional ally, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s weak regime in Syria, which collapsed in 2024, leaving it with none. China\u2019s sustained economic rise and massive strategic agreements with regional powers have not yet become a serious challenge to U.S.-led regional order. As Trump seeks to solidify the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, he faces political escalation within Israel threatening to derail peace efforts. After the Gaza war, Arab regimes have reawakened to the centrality of the Palestinian issue. Leaders, wary of popular uprisings and potential protests, recognize the depth of public anger over ethnic cleansing and destruction in Gaza. Saudi Arabia reaffirmed the Arab Peace Initiative\u2014achieving peace with Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state\u2014highlighting a significant shift in Arab stance. The terms of the Gaza ceasefire, excluding Palestinian displacement and West Bank annexation, align more closely with Arab preferences, including those of Israel. Yet, Israel\u2019s military dominance and Arab resignation will not ensure a sustainable regional order. Regional Israeli leadership requires either shared goals or a shared sense of threat. Israel has undermined both. Its destruction of Gaza and pursuit of West Bank annexation have erased any possibility of serious dialogue on a fair Palestinian state solution. The Israeli political level is nearing exhaustion over the return of Hamas\u2019s hostages\u2019 bodies, with officials reportedly considering renewed targeted assassinations and ground maneuvers to expand Israeli control, while the multinational force\u2019s entry into Gaza remains delayed. Israel overestimates its military power. Despite bold, surprise strikes and clear air superiority, it lacks an army capable of occupying territories beyond Palestine and Syria, which it has controlled for 55 years. While it has achieved tactical goals through assassinations and bombing, it has failed to achieve strategic objectives: Hamas remains the dominant force in Gaza, Hezbollah refuses to disarm despite heavy losses, and Israel\u2019s 12-day campaign against Iran failed to end Iran\u2019s nuclear program or provoke regime change. Lynch concludes that Israel may see itself as the new regional hegemon, but in reality, it has become less necessary and less useful. After the Doha attack, Gulf leaders will no longer direct all their air defenses toward Iran and Yemen, as Israel has now become a threat to their security\u2014equal to Iran. Israel\u2019s ability to avoid significant costs for its military expansion and Gaza\u2019s destruction has fostered a false sense of invulnerability. This mirrors Israel\u2019s pre-1973 belief that no Arab state would dare attack it, leading to the surprise Egyptian and Syrian war on October 6, 1973. Similarly, Israel believed Hamas would remain confined to Gaza forever, until October 7, 2023\u2014a day described by Israelis as the deadliest and most severe since the 1973 war.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[24.ae](https://24.ae/article/927974/%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8B%D9%84%D9%83%D9%86-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF)\n\n**Turkish foreign minister: Israeli attacks in Gaza are threatening ceasefire stability**\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned on November 4, 2025, that Israel's recent violations of the Gaza ceasefire, including airstrikes that killed over 200 people since the peace deal began on October 10, 2025, are threatening the stability of the fragile truce. Speaking after a summit in Istanbul with foreign ministers from Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, Fidan emphasized the need for sustained international pressure on Israel to prevent a resurgence of violence. He reaffirmed Turkey\u2019s commitment to the U.S.-brokered peace plan, which includes a temporary international stabilization force composed of European, U.S., and Arab personnel, though no concrete timeline for deployment has been set. Fidan stated Turkey may be excluded from participation due to its criticism of Israeli conduct during the war. He also highlighted that Israeli attacks have disrupted the delivery of humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies. Fidan called for Palestinian self-governance, asserting that 'Palestinians should govern the Palestinians and ensure their own security,' and urged the international community to support this through diplomatic, institutional, and economic means. He noted that a Hamas delegation met with him over the weekend and expressed openness to transferring control of Gaza to a Palestinian-led authority. The peace plan envisions a 'technocratic and apolitical' Palestinian committee governing Gaza under the supervision of the 'Board of Peace,' chaired by President Trump, with the Palestinian Authority potentially assuming governance after reforms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 08:21 AM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/4/turkish-foreign-minister-israeli-attacks-gaza-threatening-ceasefire/)\n\n**Turkey Hosts Gaza Summit Amid Alleged Israeli Violations of Ceasefire Agreement**\nTurkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia's foreign ministers held a Gaza summit in Istanbul on November 3, 2025, demanding that Israel fully comply with the ceasefire agreement and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Despite a 20-point peace plan mediated by the U.S. that led to a temporary ceasefire, reports indicate Israel continued bombing Gaza, and no international stabilization force has been deployed as agreed. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Israel for failing to uphold the U.S.-mediated agreement and obstructing food and medicine from entering Gaza. Fidan urged greater international pressure on Israel to adhere to the ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu claimed that Hamas did not properly transfer the remains of hostages, justifying continued attacks that resulted in over 100 deaths, including 46 children. Although Israel stated it would continue to abide by the ceasefire, the Arab News reported ongoing Palestinian civilian deaths due to Israeli military actions. The BBC noted that the first phase of the ceasefire, effective October 9, 2023, included Hamas releasing all surviving Israeli hostages, returning deceased hostages\u2019 remains, and Israeli military withdrawal to designated areas. However, the terms heavily favored Israel\u2014requiring Hamas to fully withdraw from Gaza and have no role in future governance\u2014leading to widespread skepticism about the next phase. The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, firing over 3,000 rockets into Israel, killing approximately 1,000 Israeli civilians, prompting Israel\u2019s full-scale military campaign in Gaza, which has resulted in at least 68,000 deaths and 170,000 injuries. While a temporary ceasefire has been established, many issues remain unresolved, keeping global attention high.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/9116225)\n\n**Arab and Islamic Nations Hold Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Gaza Ceasefire, Turkey Criticizes Israel's 'Violation of Agreement'**\nOn November 3, 2025, foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic nations convened in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, which had been implemented based on the Trump administration's peace proposal. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Israel during a post-meeting press conference, stating that Israel had committed provocative actions after the ceasefire took effect, resulting in nearly 240 Gazan civilian deaths, and had failed to meet the agreed-upon levels of humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. According to the Gaza authorities, Israeli military attacks targeting the Islamist group Hamas have killed approximately 240 people since the ceasefire began on October 10. Fidan emphasized that aid deliveries were 'significantly below' the agreed amount. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has previously labeled Hamas as a liberation movement rather than a terrorist organization and accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, while simultaneously using his close ties with Hamas to persuade it to accept the peace plan and gain credibility with the U.S. administration. Turkey is now seen as a key player in shaping Gaza\u2019s future. Under the peace proposal, an International Stabilization Force (ISF) is expected to temporarily maintain security in Gaza by monitoring arms flows and other measures. Fidan stated Turkey is 'ready to do whatever is necessary' and expressed willingness to participate in the ISF, but stressed that the force\u2019s role must be clearly defined first. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled opposition to Turkey\u2019s participation, making the process uncertain. The meeting included Turkey, as host, along with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan from the Middle East, and Pakistan and Indonesia from Asia\u2014nations believed to have potential roles in sustaining the ceasefire, including through ISF involvement, Hamas disarmament, and ending Israeli attacks on Gaza.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[\u7523\u7d4c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.sankei.com/article/20251104-ONSNX6GOFZP33NQM7APWLXYYG4/)\n\n**Occupying Israel Continues Attacking Gaza Despite Ceasefire**\nFilipino officials report that the humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached 'catastrophic' levels due to ongoing Israeli attacks, despite the ceasefire agreement. According to local sources, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes and demolitions in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shuqayya neighborhood and targeted Beit Lahiya in the north using artillery fire. Both areas lie east of the Green Line, which covers more than half of the Gaza Strip's total area. Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmud Basal stated that Israeli forces continued attacks using explosive-laden robots, warplanes, and artillery throughout the night. Civil defense teams are recovering bodies from rubble and relocating corpses from temporary graves\u2014established during the war in parks, schools, and mosque courtyards\u2014into official cemeteries. The European-Mediterranean Human Rights Observatory confirmed the discovery of dozens of temporary burial sites. Since the ceasefire began, some remains have been exhumed and reburied in formal cemeteries. However, conditions remain dire: Basal emphasized that hunger persists, with aid trucks entering Gaza at a minimal rate. Israel allows only symbolic entry of non-essential goods like fruits and dried nuts, while basic food supplies remain scarce. The population, having lost most income sources, cannot afford these limited goods. Basal accused Israel of turning aid trucks into propaganda tools, noting that only 24% of the aid promised under the agreement has reached Gaza. Hamas reported that only 136 aid trucks entered daily\u2014far below the agreed 600 per day\u2014while the rest carried commercial goods that the population cannot afford. The Gaza Government Press Office confirmed that the 600-truck daily target has never been met. Despite the ceasefire, the population continues to suffer from food shortages, high prices, and inequitable aid distribution. The United Nations stated in October 2025 that even if Israeli attacks stopped, hunger in Gaza would not end. The two-year conflict, which began on October 8, 2023, and was formally ended by a ceasefire on October 10, 2025, has resulted in 68,865 Palestinian deaths and 170,670 injuries, with women and children comprising the majority. The UN reports that 90% of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed, with reconstruction estimated at $70 billion. Israel has violated the ceasefire multiple times, resulting in 226 Palestinian deaths and 600 injuries, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 05:22 AM\nSource:[Haberler | Son Dakika Haberleri - Dirili\u015f Postas\u0131](https://www.dirilispostasi.com/isgalci-israil-ateskese-ragmen-gazzeye-saldirmaya-devam-ediyor)\n\n**The Region Has Changed\u2014But Israel Is Unable to Lead the New Middle East**\nThe Middle East regional order is rapidly evolving, but not in the way envisioned by many Israeli and American officials.

Moreover, Israel appears unaware of the depth of Trump\u2019s growing ties with Gulf states. Israeli leadership, driven by wishful thinking and a powerful security establishment, has exploited its overwhelming military force since Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 attack\u2014destroying Gaza entirely, crossing long-standing red lines, assassinating high-profile figures such as Hezbollah\u2019s Hassan Nasrallah, Hamas\u2019s Ismail Haniyeh in Iran, Iranian military leaders in Syria, and Yemen\u2019s Houthi prime minister. Israel\u2019s attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear and military sites marked its resolve to strike at its greatest enemy. The failed attempt to assassinate Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, was a turning point. Trump reportedly reacted with visible displeasure as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu read a written apology to the Emir of Qatar, symbolizing a geopolitical shift that led to the Gaza ceasefire, according to Lynch. However, it remains unclear whether Trump\u2019s anger will lead to meaningful changes beyond the current ceasefire. U.S. analyst Alexander Langlois asserts that the so-called 'ceasefire' in Gaza no longer exists in practice, as Israel resumed full military operations against Hamas on October 28, 2024, effectively nullifying any real meaning of the truce. Lynch urges Israel to retreat from the brink, seize the opportunity presented by the ceasefire to reduce military adventurism, and pursue a sustainable regional order\u2014only achievable through serious movement toward a Palestinian state. The prolonged conflict has exposed Israel\u2019s vulnerabilities: its missile defenses are not foolproof, its economy cannot sustain endless war, its internal politics are strained, and its military remains heavily dependent on the U.S. The Gaza war has eroded Israel\u2019s global standing, leaving it increasingly isolated and alone. President Isaac Herzog warned of rising levels of incitement and violence in Israel, comparable to those preceding the assassination of former PM Yitzhak Rabin. The region\u2019s new order cannot be imposed by Israel through military force alone. Leadership requires not just military dominance but also regional acceptance and cooperation. No Middle Eastern power wants Israeli leadership, and all now fear Israel\u2019s aggressive power. While some in Washington welcome Israel\u2019s destruction of U.S. adversaries, they must exercise caution: Israel\u2019s interests diverge from U.S. interests. Israel writes many checks and expects the U.S. to pay, but Washington may not want or be able to honor them. Israel\u2019s attempts to reshape the region have exceeded imagination and swim against the current. The Middle East\u2019s regional order had remained remarkably stable for 35 years, despite ongoing violence, with only brief moments of potential change that did not last. The structure consists of a non-popular, unpopular U.S. hegemony opposing a strong regional divide into two rival blocs. U.S. dominance, weakened by the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2008 financial crisis, is no longer as solid as in past decades. Multipolarity remains distant. Russia had only one regional ally, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s weak regime in Syria, which collapsed in 2024, leaving it with none. China\u2019s sustained economic rise and massive strategic agreements with regional powers have not yet become a serious challenge to U.S.-led regional order. As Trump seeks to solidify the U.S.-brokered Gaza ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, he faces political escalation within Israel threatening to derail peace efforts. After the Gaza war, Arab regimes have reawakened to the centrality of the Palestinian issue. Leaders, wary of popular uprisings and potential protests, recognize the depth of public anger over ethnic cleansing and destruction in Gaza. Saudi Arabia reaffirmed the Arab Peace Initiative\u2014achieving peace with Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state\u2014highlighting a significant shift in Arab stance. The terms of the Gaza ceasefire, excluding Palestinian displacement and West Bank annexation, align more closely with Arab preferences, including those of Israel. Yet, Israel\u2019s military dominance and Arab resignation will not ensure a sustainable regional order. Regional Israeli leadership requires either shared goals or a shared sense of threat. Israel has undermined both. Its destruction of Gaza and pursuit of West Bank annexation have erased any possibility of serious dialogue on a fair Palestinian state solution. The Israeli political level is nearing exhaustion over the return of Hamas\u2019s hostages\u2019 bodies, with officials reportedly considering renewed targeted assassinations and ground maneuvers to expand Israeli control, while the multinational force\u2019s entry into Gaza remains delayed. Israel overestimates its military power. Despite bold, surprise strikes and clear air superiority, it lacks an army capable of occupying territories beyond Palestine and Syria, which it has controlled for 55 years. While it has achieved tactical goals through assassinations and bombing, it has failed to achieve strategic objectives: Hamas remains the dominant force in Gaza, Hezbollah refuses to disarm despite heavy losses, and Israel\u2019s 12-day campaign against Iran failed to end Iran\u2019s nuclear program or provoke regime change. Lynch concludes that Israel may see itself as the new regional hegemon, but in reality, it has become less necessary and less useful. After the Doha attack, Gulf leaders will no longer direct all their air defenses toward Iran and Yemen, as Israel has now become a threat to their security\u2014equal to Iran. Israel\u2019s ability to avoid significant costs for its military expansion and Gaza\u2019s destruction has fostered a false sense of invulnerability. This mirrors Israel\u2019s pre-1973 belief that no Arab state would dare attack it, leading to the surprise Egyptian and Syrian war on October 6, 1973. Similarly, Israel believed Hamas would remain confined to Gaza forever, until October 7, 2023\u2014a day described by Israelis as the deadliest and most severe since the 1973 war.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[24.ae](https://24.ae/article/927974/%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%8B%D9%84%D9%83%D9%86-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF)\n\n**Turkish foreign minister: Israeli attacks in Gaza are threatening ceasefire stability**\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warned on November 4, 2025, that Israel's recent violations of the Gaza ceasefire, including airstrikes that killed over 200 people since the peace deal began on October 10, 2025, are threatening the stability of the fragile truce. Speaking after a summit in Istanbul with foreign ministers from Indonesia, Jordan, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, Fidan emphasized the need for sustained international pressure on Israel to prevent a resurgence of violence. He reaffirmed Turkey\u2019s commitment to the U.S.-brokered peace plan, which includes a temporary international stabilization force composed of European, U.S., and Arab personnel, though no concrete timeline for deployment has been set. Fidan stated Turkey may be excluded from participation due to its criticism of Israeli conduct during the war. He also highlighted that Israeli attacks have disrupted the delivery of humanitarian aid, including food and medical supplies. Fidan called for Palestinian self-governance, asserting that 'Palestinians should govern the Palestinians and ensure their own security,' and urged the international community to support this through diplomatic, institutional, and economic means. He noted that a Hamas delegation met with him over the weekend and expressed openness to transferring control of Gaza to a Palestinian-led authority. The peace plan envisions a 'technocratic and apolitical' Palestinian committee governing Gaza under the supervision of the 'Board of Peace,' chaired by President Trump, with the Palestinian Authority potentially assuming governance after reforms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 08:21 AM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/nov/4/turkish-foreign-minister-israeli-attacks-gaza-threatening-ceasefire/)\n\n**Turkey Hosts Gaza Summit Amid Alleged Israeli Violations of Ceasefire Agreement**\nTurkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia's foreign ministers held a Gaza summit in Istanbul on November 3, 2025, demanding that Israel fully comply with the ceasefire agreement and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. Despite a 20-point peace plan mediated by the U.S. that led to a temporary ceasefire, reports indicate Israel continued bombing Gaza, and no international stabilization force has been deployed as agreed. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Israel for failing to uphold the U.S.-mediated agreement and obstructing food and medicine from entering Gaza. Fidan urged greater international pressure on Israel to adhere to the ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu claimed that Hamas did not properly transfer the remains of hostages, justifying continued attacks that resulted in over 100 deaths, including 46 children. Although Israel stated it would continue to abide by the ceasefire, the Arab News reported ongoing Palestinian civilian deaths due to Israeli military actions. The BBC noted that the first phase of the ceasefire, effective October 9, 2023, included Hamas releasing all surviving Israeli hostages, returning deceased hostages\u2019 remains, and Israeli military withdrawal to designated areas. However, the terms heavily favored Israel\u2014requiring Hamas to fully withdraw from Gaza and have no role in future governance\u2014leading to widespread skepticism about the next phase. The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched Operation Al-Aqsa Flood, firing over 3,000 rockets into Israel, killing approximately 1,000 Israeli civilians, prompting Israel\u2019s full-scale military campaign in Gaza, which has resulted in at least 68,000 deaths and 170,000 injuries. While a temporary ceasefire has been established, many issues remain unresolved, keeping global attention high.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/9116225)\n\n**Arab and Islamic Nations Hold Foreign Ministers' Meeting on Gaza Ceasefire, Turkey Criticizes Israel's 'Violation of Agreement'**\nOn November 3, 2025, foreign ministers from Arab and Islamic nations convened in Istanbul, Turkey, to discuss the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, which had been implemented based on the Trump administration's peace proposal. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan criticized Israel during a post-meeting press conference, stating that Israel had committed provocative actions after the ceasefire took effect, resulting in nearly 240 Gazan civilian deaths, and had failed to meet the agreed-upon levels of humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza. According to the Gaza authorities, Israeli military attacks targeting the Islamist group Hamas have killed approximately 240 people since the ceasefire began on October 10. Fidan emphasized that aid deliveries were 'significantly below' the agreed amount. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has previously labeled Hamas as a liberation movement rather than a terrorist organization and accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, while simultaneously using his close ties with Hamas to persuade it to accept the peace plan and gain credibility with the U.S. administration. Turkey is now seen as a key player in shaping Gaza\u2019s future. Under the peace proposal, an International Stabilization Force (ISF) is expected to temporarily maintain security in Gaza by monitoring arms flows and other measures. Fidan stated Turkey is 'ready to do whatever is necessary' and expressed willingness to participate in the ISF, but stressed that the force\u2019s role must be clearly defined first. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled opposition to Turkey\u2019s participation, making the process uncertain. The meeting included Turkey, as host, along with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Jordan from the Middle East, and Pakistan and Indonesia from Asia\u2014nations believed to have potential roles in sustaining the ceasefire, including through ISF involvement, Hamas disarmament, and ending Israeli attacks on Gaza.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[\u7523\u7d4c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.sankei.com/article/20251104-ONSNX6GOFZP33NQM7APWLXYYG4/)\n\n**Erdo\u011fan: Hamas Committed to Gaza Ceasefire Amid International Efforts for Reconstruction and Governance**\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan stated on November 3, 2025, that Hamas is 'determined' to uphold the Gaza ceasefire, emphasizing the need for Islamic countries to play a leading role in rebuilding Palestinian territories. Speaking at the annual COMCEC economic cooperation summit in Istanbul, Erdo\u011fan noted that Hamas appears committed to honoring the agreement, while criticizing Israel's record on compliance. Turkey is hosting foreign ministers from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia to discuss Gaza's reconstruction amid concerns over the fragile truce that began on October 10, 2025. Erdo\u011fan stressed the urgent implementation of a joint Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) reconstruction plan unveiled in March. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who met with Hamas's political bureau head Khalil al-Hayya, called for an end to the 'massacre in Gaza' and reiterated the need for a two-state solution, Palestinian self-governance, and mechanisms to ensure security and administration in Gaza. Fidan also highlighted the importance of humanitarian aid and urged Western allies for support. Israel remains skeptical of Turkey\u2019s diplomatic role, opposing its involvement in a proposed international stabilization force. Meanwhile, Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, are meeting in Cairo to discuss a transitional administration for Gaza, with plans for a technocratic committee under Palestinian Authority oversight. Fatah denies authorizing the committee\u2019s leadership and insists on exclusive authority for the Palestinian leadership. On October 24, 2025, Palestinian factions agreed on a temporary committee of independents and a UN Security Council resolution for a temporary international monitoring force. Israel confirmed the return of the bodies of three hostages on November 3, 2025, following a ceasefire agreement, though Hamas still holds 48 hostages, 20 of whom are alive. Israel claims Hamas is delaying the return of remains, while Hamas says it is working under difficult conditions. The Israeli military reported a strike killed one man in northern Gaza, citing a threat, while Gaza\u2019s health ministry reported 7 deaths and 6 injuries in the past 24 hours. Since the October 7, 2023, attack, 68,865 Palestinians have been killed and 170,670 injured in Gaza. Since the October 11, 2025, ceasefire, 236 have died and 600 were injured by Israeli forces.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[https://www.alanba.com.kw/newspaper/](https://www.alanba.com.kw/BBCNews/18270)\n\n**Occupying Israel Continues Attacking Gaza Despite Ceasefire**\nFilipino officials report that the humanitarian situation in Gaza has reached 'catastrophic' levels due to ongoing Israeli attacks, despite the ceasefire agreement. According to local sources, the Israeli military conducted airstrikes and demolitions in the eastern part of Gaza City's Shuqayya neighborhood and targeted Beit Lahiya in the north using artillery fire. Both areas lie east of the Green Line, which covers more than half of the Gaza Strip's total area. Gaza Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmud Basal stated that Israeli forces continued attacks using explosive-laden robots, warplanes, and artillery throughout the night. Civil defense teams are recovering bodies from rubble and relocating corpses from temporary graves\u2014established during the war in parks, schools, and mosque courtyards\u2014into official cemeteries. The European-Mediterranean Human Rights Observatory confirmed the discovery of dozens of temporary burial sites. Since the ceasefire began, some remains have been exhumed and reburied in formal cemeteries. However, conditions remain dire: Basal emphasized that hunger persists, with aid trucks entering Gaza at a minimal rate. Israel allows only symbolic entry of non-essential goods like fruits and dried nuts, while basic food supplies remain scarce. The population, having lost most income sources, cannot afford these limited goods. Basal accused Israel of turning aid trucks into propaganda tools, noting that only 24% of the aid promised under the agreement has reached Gaza. Hamas reported that only 136 aid trucks entered daily\u2014far below the agreed 600 per day\u2014while the rest carried commercial goods that the population cannot afford. The Gaza Government Press Office confirmed that the 600-truck daily target has never been met. Despite the ceasefire, the population continues to suffer from food shortages, high prices, and inequitable aid distribution. The United Nations stated in October 2025 that even if Israeli attacks stopped, hunger in Gaza would not end. The two-year conflict, which began on October 8, 2023, and was formally ended by a ceasefire on October 10, 2025, has resulted in 68,865 Palestinian deaths and 170,670 injuries, with women and children comprising the majority. The UN reports that 90% of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure has been destroyed, with reconstruction estimated at $70 billion. Israel has violated the ceasefire multiple times, resulting in 226 Palestinian deaths and 600 injuries, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 05:22 AM\nSource:[Haberler | Son Dakika Haberleri - Dirili\u015f Postas\u0131](https://www.dirilispostasi.com/isgalci-israil-ateskese-ragmen-gazzeye-saldirmaya-devam-ediyor)\n\n**New Violations: Israeli Occupation Conducts Airstrikes on Gaza Strip**\nOn October 31, 2025, staff at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza Strip, transferred a body handed over by Israeli authorities to Gaza via the Red Cross. According to a security source in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes and gunfire were heard around Khan Yunis on Saturday, October 31, 2025. An Israeli military spokesperson stated that the bodies returned were not those of hostages, a claim confirmed later by the Israeli forensic medicine laboratory. In a statement, the military wing of Hamas, the Al-Qassam Brigades, said they offered three samples from unidentified bodies for testing but were rejected by Israel, which demanded the full bodies instead. Hamas stated it delivered the bodies to prevent Israeli allegations. This is not the first time Israel has claimed to return remains that do not belong to hostages since the ceasefire began on October 10, 2025. Since the truce, Israel and Hamas have exchanged accusations of violations. Israel has accused Hamas repeatedly of breaching the agreement, while families of hostages have called for increased pressure on Hamas to comply. So far, Hamas has returned 17 of the 28 hostages held, including 15 Israelis, one Thai national, and one Nepali. Ten hostages abducted during the October 7, 2023 attack remain in Gaza, along with the body of a soldier killed in 2014. Under the ceasefire terms, Israel is to return 15 Palestinian bodies for each Israeli body handed over by Hamas, totaling 225 Palestinian remains. In Gaza, humanitarian and security conditions remain dire. Hisham Al-Bradai (37), a father of a family, reported hearing multiple Israeli gunfire incidents at night, stating, 'The ceasefire has started, but the war hasn't ended yet.' Somya Dloul (27), who lives with her parents, said, 'There is no meaning to life. Death is better than life. We have no money, no work, no food, no water, no electricity, no internet.' The Gaza government media office estimates that 20,000 unexploded munitions from the war and occupation remain scattered across the territory. Jordan and Germany have called for the international force planned under Trump\u2019s ceasefire plan to be under UN mandate. The plan, consisting of 20 points, includes establishing a temporary international stability force in Gaza to provide training and support to a Palestinian police force approved by the parties. Turkey will host a meeting of foreign ministers from Islamic countries in Istanbul on Monday to support the U.S. plan. Attendees are expected to include ministers from the UAE, Qatar, Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt (which has not confirmed participation). U.S. President Donald Trump met with leaders and foreign ministers of these countries in New York on September 23, 2025, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. The Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, killed 1,221 people, mostly civilians, according to a count by AFP based on official Israeli data. Israel\u2019s military response has killed at least 68,531 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, which the UN considers reliable.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 01:24 PM\nSource:[thenationpress.net](https://thenationpress.net/news-271877.html)\n\n**Can Trump's Gaza Peace Council Plan Avoid Past International Administration Failures?**\nThe proposed 'Peace Council' international administration for Gaza, part of former U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, has sparked intense debate among international policy and law experts. The plan, introduced amid the aftermath of a two-year Israeli military campaign that caused tens of thousands of Palestinian civilian casualties and widespread destruction, aims to establish a transitional international authority to manage Gaza, support reconstruction, and restart political life. Experts remain divided on its viability. While some, like Professor Radeed Abu Badawi from the Arab American University, argue that international administrations are often a necessary temporary measure during state collapse or intense geopolitical competition to restore security and deliver basic services, others, such as scholar Heather Benatzer and legal expert Anis al-Qasim, warn that such models historically suffer from lack of local legitimacy, overreach, and foreign bureaucratic dominance. They emphasize that past cases\u2014such as Timor-Leste (relatively successful), Kosovo (partial stability), and Cambodia (failure to build sustainable institutions)\u2014show that international rule rarely leads to genuine national sovereignty unless it is built on local participation, clear mandates, and regional support. Critics, including Mohsen Saleh from Al-Zaytouna Center, reject the proposal outright, calling it a 'step backward in history' that reinforces foreign domination and rewards Israeli occupation. They stress that the core issue in Gaza is ongoing Israeli occupation, not lack of Palestinian governance, and that Palestinians possess the capacity to self-govern once occupation ends. The plan's credibility is further undermined by concerns over the selection of figures like Tony Blair to lead the council, whose controversial record in the Middle East raises questions about impartiality and potential conflicts of interest. Experts unanimously agree that the success of any international administration in Gaza depends on genuine Palestinian participation, especially from factions like Hamas, transparent oversight, and a clear exit strategy. The plan emerged from a ceasefire agreement brokered in October 2025 by Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, but Israel's repeated violations have continued to fuel casualties and distrust. Ultimately, the proposal is seen as a temporary response to a crisis, not a sustainable solution, and its long-term success hinges on respecting Palestinian sovereignty and rejecting external imposition.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:15 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/politics/2025/10/29/%d9%87%d9%84-%d8%aa%d9%86%d8%ac%d8%ad-%d8%ae%d8%b7%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%85%d8%a8-%d8%a8%d8%ba%d8%b2%d8%a9-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%aa%d9%81%d8%a7%d8%af%d9%8a-%d8%a3%d8%ae%d8%b7%d8%a7%d8%a1)\n\n**Netanyahu Resumes 'Powerful Attacks' on Gaza Amid Breakdown of Trump-Brokered Peace Plan**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ended the ceasefire with Hamas, citing delays in the release of hostages and renewed attacks by Hamas in Rafah, including a recent assault on Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) members. The decision to resume 'powerful attacks' on Gaza follows the breakdown of the Trump-backed peace plan, which required Hamas to disarm and withdraw from political life in exchange for Arab investment and a provisional government leading to a future Palestinian state\u2014conditions both sides rejected. The article argues that Hamas, backed by Iran, Qatar, and Turkey, seeks chaos against the West, not statehood, and that the October 7, 2023 attacks were a strategic ploy to provoke an excessive Israeli response and isolate Israel diplomatically. Despite international support, including from the U.S. and Arab states, Netanyahu\u2019s refusal to accept a strong Palestinian administration in Gaza stems from his desire to maintain Israeli control, especially over the West Bank and Gaza, which he views as incompatible with a sovereign Palestinian state. The article notes that Netanyahu\u2019s unilateral actions, including the recent military escalation, bypassed prior consultation with the U.S., particularly President Donald Trump, who had previously demanded strict adherence to the 20-point plan. Trump\u2019s envoy team, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Jared Kushner, had been sent to monitor compliance, but the Israeli Knesset\u2019s approval of annexing West Bank settlements was seen as a provocation. The article questions the practicality of continued military action, noting that Hamas remains active despite two years of bombing and that 90% of hostages have been released through U.S.-brokered truces. It concludes that while the U.S. may support Israel, the long-term viability of peace depends on Arab cooperation, as seen by the continued diplomatic ties between Israel and Gulf states even during the worst phases of the conflict. Without Arab buy-in, peace, reconstruction, and international recognition\u2014including the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014remain out of reach.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 08:56 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/edicion/20251028/netanyahu-desafia-nuevo-trump-pone-alto-fuego-cuarentena-ataques-potentes-contrahamas-gaza/1003743990121_16.html)\n\n**The dilemma of ending the war has reached its most critical juncture**\nFollowing a ceasefire in Gaza on October 17, 2025, a complex postwar governance dilemma has emerged, marked by conflicting visions among Israel, the United States, and the international community. Israel seeks to maintain security control over Gaza, including border crossings, and aims to fully dismantle Hamas\u2019s military capabilities, reject Palestinian Authority (PA) authority, and destroy all tunnels\u2014despite the ceasefire. The U.S. Trump peace plan calls for a phased Israeli withdrawal under temporary international supervision, with a transitional administration led by donor states and institutions, eventually handing control to a reformed PA. However, Hamas has regained administrative control in areas vacated by Israeli forces, signaling readiness to retain military power. Israel violated the ceasefire by restricting humanitarian aid and resuming military actions, citing incomplete repatriation of Israeli captives\u2019 remains\u2014widely deemed unrealistic given Gaza\u2019s destruction. Gaza\u2019s infrastructure is nearly destroyed, and aid delivery remains constrained by Israeli control of crossings. The September New York Declaration calls for Palestinian-led governance post-hostilities, contingent on PA reform, but lacks operational mechanisms. The international plan envisions an international force to secure infrastructure, train police, and oversee disarmament, but faces resistance due to Israel\u2019s refusal to cede control and the reality of Gaza\u2019s fragmented local power structures. Palestinian distrust in international guarantees\u2014due to unfulfilled promises of reconstruction and accountability\u2014raises fears that international oversight could amount to a 'soft occupation.' A viable path forward, according to the article, is a Palestinian-led transitional administration formed through internal consensus, supported by Arab states, the UN, and EU, with technical oversight and political-security coordination. Reconstruction must be driven by Palestinian institutions, not external imposition. The article stresses the urgent need for internal Palestinian dialogue and the necessity of a two-state solution, with full Palestinian sovereignty and East Jerusalem as its capital. A UN Security Council resolution is called for to end Israel\u2019s occupation, guarantee Palestinian statehood, and establish a clear transition timetable, rejecting indefinite 'guardianship.' Regional actors like Arab states must act as guarantors, not mediators, to ensure a sustainable ceasefire and long-term stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Middle East Monitor](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20251017-the-dilemma-of-ending-the-war-has-reached-its-most-critical-juncture/)\n\n**The collaborative nature of this Middle Eastern peacemaking reinforces legitimate hope**\nThe release of remaining Israeli hostages by Hamas on October 14, 2025, marks a significant step in the 20-point peace plan developed by former U.S. President Donald Trump and key regional and European partners. This plan, hailed as the most substantial progress toward peace in the two-year conflict following the October 2023 Hamas attacks, outlines a structured path including a ceasefire, demilitarization of Gaza, phased Israeli withdrawal, international oversight of reconstruction, and mechanisms for transitioning to technocratic Palestinian governance. The plan has garnered broad international support and reflects a strategic shift toward proactive U.S. diplomatic leadership in maintaining a stable global order. Regional cooperation\u2014led by Qatar, Egypt, the UAE, Turkey, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia\u2014has been instrumental in crafting the plan, signaling a profound geopolitical shift that may enable new coalitions to move beyond long-standing, rigid positions. However, major challenges remain: Hamas has not agreed to disarmament provisions, Israel seeks to limit its withdrawal, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government may resist the establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. Without credible security guarantees, effective aid delivery, and reforms to Palestinian governance, the prospects for a durable solution remain uncertain. Still, the existence of a detailed, internationally backed framework offers legitimate grounds for hope, especially given Trump\u2019s assertion to the Israeli Knesset on October 13, 2025, that 'This long and difficult war has now ended.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:54 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/collaborative-nature-middle-eastern-peacemaking-005401527.html)\n\n**Hamas to Release Hostages and Abandon Future Governance of Gaza, Per Peace Plan**\nThe Hamas group announced to AFP on Sunday, October 12, 2025, that it will release remaining hostages held in Gaza on Monday, October 13, and will not participate in any future government of the territory after the war. The ceasefire agreement, which began on Friday, includes the exchange of the last remaining hostages\u2014both alive and deceased\u2014for nearly 2,000 Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons, including 250 held on 'national security grounds.' The two sides are now negotiating the implementation of former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm and relinquish control of Gaza post-conflict. Humanitarian aid trucks entered Gaza on Sunday, but residents in Khan Yunis reported some were looted by hungry civilians. Mohamed Zarab stated, 'We don\u2019t want to live in the jungle. We demand that aid be guaranteed and distributed respectfully.' The peace plan also proposes replacing the Israeli military with a multinational force composed of Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE, coordinated by a U.S.-led command center in Israel. A Hamas source confirmed to AFP that 'governing the Gaza Strip is now closed for Hamas,' though the group remains a 'fundamental part of Palestinian society.' The announcement came ahead of a peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, co-chaired by Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, attended by around 20 world leaders, including UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Trump will first visit Israel to meet with families of hostages captured during Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023, attack, which triggered a devastating Israeli military offensive. Despite the ceasefire, fears of renewed war persist: Mahmud al-Muzain said, 'Everyone fears the return of war. People steal aid and store it in their homes.' Fatima Salem, 38, expressed sorrow upon discovering her home was destroyed: 'My eyes kept searching for landmarks, but nothing looked the same.' Although the ceasefire shows progress, mediators face challenges in securing a long-term political solution. A Hamas source confirmed to AFP that 'Hamas accepts a long-term truce, during which its weapons will not be used except in response to an Israeli attack on Gaza.' The war began after Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023, attack, which killed 1,219 people in Israel, mostly civilians, according to AFP\u2019s count based on Israeli official data. On that day, Hamas captured 251 people, 47 of whom remain in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu stated on Friday that 20 are alive and 28 died in captivity. Israel\u2019s subsequent offensive has killed at least 67,682 people in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, a figure the UN considers reliable. The data does not distinguish between civilians and combatants but indicates over half of the deaths are women and children.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[Jovem Pan \u2013 Esportes, entretenimento, not\u00edcias e v\u00eddeos com credibilidade](https://jovempan.com.br/noticias/mundo/hamas-nao-participara-do-futuro-governo-do-territorio-depois-da-guerra.html)\n\n**Observer: Jubilation Over Ceasefire, But How Will It Be Achieved?**\nThe Arabic newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi published a report by Steve Bloomfield on October 12, 2025, analyzing the latest ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The article highlights widespread initial relief and joy over the end of hostilities, with Israeli hostages returning home and 1,700 Palestinian detainees released without trial. Both Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leadership view the deal as preferable to continued war. However, significant challenges remain: Israel\u2019s control over aid entry\u2014despite a promise of 600 trucks daily\u2014remains uncertain, with concerns over insufficient supplies given Gaza\u2019s pre-war needs and the near-total destruction of infrastructure. The article notes that Israel has a history of restricting aid, and analysts warn of potential future blockades. The proposed 'peace council' led by Donald Trump and Tony Blair is criticized by Palestinians as a new colonial arrangement. Gaza\u2019s governance remains unclear, with Hamas retaining influence despite not holding an official role, while the Palestinian Authority has minimal presence. Regional actors like Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE are preparing for a multinational stabilization force, but their roles and operational scope are ambiguous. The article underscores deep skepticism about the feasibility of rebuilding Gaza, with fears that reconstruction may serve foreign interests rather than Palestinian sovereignty. The conflict\u2019s broader implications include the ongoing push by Israel\u2019s far-right to annex the West Bank, with plans to build 3,000 homes to sever East Jerusalem from the West Bank, effectively ending the two-state solution. This plan is reportedly backed by Netanyahu\u2019s coalition and potentially by the Trump administration. The article notes that the two-state solution is no longer viable, with Israel having abandoned it long ago, and that the international community\u2019s support for it is now hollow. The absence of political opposition within Israel to the deal is alarming, especially given the opposition of far-right figures like Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The report also emphasizes the lack of accountability, with the ICC arrest warrant against Netanyahu still in effect and the International Court of Justice considering genocide charges. UN and international human rights bodies have concluded that Israel committed genocide in Gaza. The article warns that without justice and media access, the truth about Gaza\u2019s suffering may remain hidden, but increasing international scrutiny could eventually pressure Israel to change its stance.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 11:37 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0642\u062f\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a](https://www.alquds.co.uk/%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%82%D9%81-%D8%A5%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7/)\n\n**Hamas Attacks, Israel\u2019s Response, and the Peace Plan: Understanding the Gaza War and the Potential Ceasefire**\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which entered its second year on Tuesday, October 7, 2025, may be nearing a resolution following a breakthrough agreement on the first phase of a peace plan proposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. According to Trump, Israel and Hamas have agreed to the plan, which includes the release of all hostages held since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a coordinated attack on Israel, killing over 1,200 people and kidnapping 251 others. In response, Israel initiated a large-scale military operation, resulting in widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip and a severe humanitarian crisis. The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health reported over 60,000 Palestinian deaths since the conflict began. Previous ceasefire attempts in late 2023 and early 2025 failed to bring lasting stability. On Monday, October 6, 2025, delegations from Israel and Hamas held the first day of negotiations in Egypt, mediated by Egypt, the U.S., and Qatar. A second round was scheduled for Tuesday. Despite Trump\u2019s call for a halt to Israeli attacks during talks, bombings continued over the weekend, though Israeli media reported military orders to reduce offensives. The Trump plan, presented by the White House, consists of 20 points and aims to end the war immediately. It envisions Gaza as a demilitarized zone, with Hamas members granted amnesty if they disarm and commit to peaceful coexistence. Gaza would be governed by a committee of Palestinian technocrats and international experts, under the supervision of a new 'Peace Council' chaired by Trump\u2014though Israel\u2019s participation remains unclear. The Hamas leadership has 72 hours to release all hostages. The plan also calls for Israel to release nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and for the UN and the Red Crescent to manage humanitarian aid distribution. While the plan is vague on the creation of a Palestinian state, it suggests a path toward future recognition. The international community received the proposal positively, but residents of Gaza expressed hopelessness and fear of further escalation. Trump warned that failure to accept the deal would lead to a 'total hell' for Hamas, and Netanyahu confirmed Israel would continue its offensive if no agreement is reached.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 03:01 AM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/10/09/ataques-do-hamas-resposta-de-israel-plano-de-paz-entenda-a-guerra-em-gaza-e-o-possivel-cessar-fogo.ghtml)\n\n**Senate Honors Victims of Hamas Attack on Israel in 7/10 Special Session**\nThe Brazilian Federal Senate held a special session on October 7, 2025, to honor the victims of the Hamas attack on Israel, initiated on October 7, 2023. The session was requested by Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (Uni\u00e3o Brasil-AP), who is Jewish. The conflict began with a surprise Hamas assault that killed approximately 1,200 people and resulted in the kidnapping of dozens. In response, Israel declared war and launched airstrikes on the Gaza Strip. The war entered its second year on this date, amid peace negotiations mediated by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who positions himself as 'president of peace' while maintaining a strategic alliance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanding 'responsibility' and 'restraint' from Israel. Trump's 20-point Peace Plan for Gaza, developed with support from Arab allies, calls for the release of all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, a prisoner exchange, a temporary halt to bombings, a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, and the complete disarmament of Hamas under international supervision. In return, Gaza would be governed by an independent technocratic administration under international oversight led by the U.S. and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, with Hamas excluded from political governance but its members granted amnesty. Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic: according to the United Nations (UN) in 2025, over 61,000 Palestinians have died\u201483% of them civilians, a figure confirmed by internal Israeli defense data. In August 2025, the UN's Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) officially declared famine in Gaza, with over 500,000 people facing 'catastrophic' conditions due to shortages of food, water, and medicine. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres stated that 'deliberately starving people for military objectives is a war crime' and called for an immediate ceasefire. The Netanyahu government rejected these claims, calling the report 'biased' and asserting that 'there is no famine in Gaza,' attributing the crisis to the 'poor management by Hamas'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 10:18 AM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/brasil/senado-homenageia-vitimas-do-ataque-do-hamas-a-israel-em-7-10)\n\n**Two Years After Hamas Attack: Israel and Hamas Begin Peace Talks Amid Ongoing Humanitarian Crisis**\nTwo years after the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, which resulted in approximately 1,200 deaths and the kidnapping of 251 people, Israel launched a large-scale military response in Gaza. The conflict has led to a humanitarian catastrophe, with over 67,160 Palestinians killed and nearly 170,000 injured, according to the Hamas-led government in Gaza\u2014figures widely regarded by the UN and independent experts as the most reliable. The war has displaced over 2 million people, caused widespread destruction, and led to famine conditions in parts of Gaza. The United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the situation as 'a humanitarian catastrophe of a magnitude that defies comprehension' and urged a permanent ceasefire and a credible political process. On October 7, 2025, Israel and Hamas began indirect talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt, focusing on a peace plan proposed by former U.S. President Donald Trump. The plan includes a phased ceasefire, the release of remaining hostages, the disarmament of Hamas, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, and the establishment of an international security force under the supervision of Trump and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. While the plan has received broad international support and Trump stated there was a 'very good chance' of a 'lasting agreement', key issues remain unresolved, including Hamas\u2019s willingness to disarm and the future governance of Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists Hamas must surrender and disarm, but Hamas has not confirmed its stance. Meanwhile, in Israel, thousands gathered to mourn victims of the October 7 attack, while rocket fire from Gaza prompted a moment of silence. The UN and multiple experts have accused Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza of amounting to genocide, a claim Israel denies. The humanitarian crisis continues, with aid efforts being a central component of the current negotiations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 03:45 AM\nSource:[telemundo33.com](https://www.telemundo33.com/noticias/mundo/guerra-israel-hamas-gaza-muertos-heridos-dos-anos/2313306/)\n\n**A Small Window Opens for Peace in Gaza**\nOn October 6, 2025, the Hamas-led Palestinian group, which controls the Gaza Strip, announced partial acceptance of former U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan to end the conflict with Israel. The plan, which offered a path to peace but threatened total eradication if rejected, prompted indirect negotiations beginning Monday in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt\u2014without direct talks between Hamas and Israeli delegations. While there is cautious hope, especially from families of hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023, skepticism remains: Hamas did not fully accept the plan\u2019s sixth point, which calls for its demilitarization, agreeing only to surrender heavy weapons while retaining others for 'defense.' This justification is dismissed as invalid, given Hamas is not a state and its core mission is the destruction of Israel through terrorism. Hamas also agreed to transfer power in Gaza to a technocratic Palestinian government but rejected participation by international figures like Trump and Tony Blair, and insisted on retaining influence over future Palestinian governance\u2014contrary to positions held by leaders such as French President Emmanuel Macron. A critical impasse centers on the order of actions: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists on the return of hostages and remains deadlocked with Trump\u2019s plan, which proposed Israeli troop withdrawals before hostage release. Netanyahu reportedly reacted negatively to Hamas\u2019s partial acceptance, prompting Trump to personally call him, criticize his 'negativity'\u2014with some reports citing the use of profanity\u2014and frame the Hamas response as a victory for Israel. Despite low enthusiasm from both sides, the potential for progress remains. If implemented, the plan could mark the first real chance for a two-state solution since 2008, when Palestinians last rejected a territorial offer. Though the window for peace is narrow and fraught with challenges, it remains open.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[Gazeta do Povo](https://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/opiniao/editoriais/negociacoes-israel-hamas-paz-gaza/)\n\n**Israel Aims to Minimize Combat as Peace Talks Begin on Gaza Plan**\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas announced on October 3, 2025, that it accepts the U.S.-proposed peace plan for ending hostilities and establishing post-war governance in the Gaza Strip, expressing readiness to negotiate details.

Hamas expressed gratitude to Trump and Arab nations, stating it is ready to immediately negotiate the release of all 48 hostages, including remains. Regarding post-war governance, Hamas agreed to transfer authority to an independent Palestinian body but stated other issues would be discussed within the framework of Palestinian state-building. It did not address Israel\u2019s demand for disarmament. The conflict, which began in October 2023 after Hamas launched a cross-border attack killing about 1,200 Israelis and taking around 250 hostages, has resulted in over 67,000 deaths in Gaza. Israel responded with massive aerial bombardments and ground incursions, restricting humanitarian aid and triggering a severe famine. Israel also expanded operations into Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iran, including a controversial airstrike on Doha, Qatar, in September 2025, drawing international condemnation. The peace plan calls for an immediate ceasefire upon agreement, the release of all hostages within 72 hours, Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners, phased withdrawal of Israeli forces, and de-militarization of Gaza.

The plan includes a definitive ceasefire, reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, release of hostages, and the establishment of a Palestinian state under a reformed Palestinian Authority without Palestinian militias. Although Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later distanced himself from the provision recognizing the 'legitimate aspiration' of the Palestinian people\u2014calling it a 'reward for terrorism'\u2014the proposal has received support from regional powers including Turkey, Qatar, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The only remaining allies are Iran, though its influence is limited. Western leaders and the United Nations, led by Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, have endorsed the plan as 'crucial' for resolving the conflict. According to sources close to Hamas, the group appears inclined to accept, particularly due to a new provision offering amnesty to those who lay down arms. However, Hamas\u2019s history of 'all-or-nothing' tactics and disregard for civilian lives raises uncertainty. The conflict began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel, killing over 1,200 people and taking nearly 5,500 hostage. Israel\u2019s two-year response has led to the displacement of Gaza\u2019s entire population multiple times. According to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, over 67,000 people have died\u201480% of them civilians\u2014including 1,600 medical workers, 310 UN staff (the highest death toll in UN history), 120 academics, and 251 journalists\u2014more than in the First and Second World Wars combined. The ultimatum warns that if Hamas does not accept the plan within hours, Netanyahu will 'finish the job.' Despite the high stakes, the end of the war appears near, though uncertainty remains typical of the Middle East.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[www.elcolombiano.com](https://www.elcolombiano.com/opinion/editoriales/se-acerca-el-fin-de-la-guerra-MP29628501)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasting experts from a diverse set of backgrounds\u2014diplomacy, military strategy, political science, Middle East studies, and international law\u2014universally assign a very low probability to Israel establishing formal direct governmental control over at least 50% of the Gaza Strip in 2025, as defined by the question and fine print. \n\nCore points of consensus are:\n- All experts agree that while Israel maintains significant de facto military and security control over Gaza, this does not meet the high threshold for formal governmental control or annexation as required for a 'Yes' resolution (i.e., a government headed by Israelis, or formal, public annexation).\n- Intense and coordinated international and regional opposition\u2014primarily from the US, Arab states, EU, and organizations like the UN\u2014acts as a powerful deterrent to formal Israeli rule. All current peace processes, including the Trump-brokered plan, specifically advocate for either international or Palestinian-led transitional governance.\n- The base rate for occupying powers formalizing government or annexation under such circumstances is extremely low, with Israel itself maintaining a decades-long pattern of avoiding direct rule in Gaza since 2005.\n- Israeli domestic politics introduce some tail risk: There is pressure from far-right and security hawks to take more maximalist steps. However, actual steps toward formal government formation are constrained by military, administrative, economic, and diplomatic costs, as well as internal political divisions and public war fatigue.\n- The operational, logistical, legal, and reputational risks of direct rule are considered prohibitive, especially given ongoing war crimes allegations, ICC/ICJ proceedings, and humanitarian disaster in Gaza.\n- Experts envision 'No' as the default scenario: Continued de facto military control, with international or technocratic Palestinian temporary governance (however dysfunctional), but no formal Israeli-headed government or annexation.\n- 'Yes' scenarios are considered extremely rare and require either a total collapse of all international and Palestinian governance arrangements, a major crisis or attack, or dramatic rightward shift in Israeli domestic politics\u2014none of which are observed in available reporting or diplomatic trends as of November 2025.\n\nFinal probability estimates are tightly clustered between 3% and 10%, with most falling between 4% and 8%. No expert assesses the probability as zero, reflecting some awareness of unpredictability and the potential for catastrophic 'black swan' events, but the overwhelming consensus is that the outcome is highly unlikely.\n\nIn sum, the experts expect that Israel will not formally establish direct governmental control or annex at least 50% of the Gaza Strip in 2025. The status quo of de facto military control combined with international/transitional administrative arrangements is overwhelmingly likely to hold through the year.",
