The news does not report any new executive having begun a prison term since the last batch of sentences, and with only two months left, the time window for new, qualifying imprisonments is extremely narrow.

With less than two months left, the likelihood of a new, high-profile executive being sentenced and their sentence starting within the time frame is very low. Differential Association Theory suggests that corporate environments continue to foster cultures of collective impunity, diffusing responsibility and normalizing behavior that is hard to prosecute as criminal at the executive level.

The demonstration featured masks of top bank executives, inflatable champagne bottles, and promotional swag, echoing the tone of the 2008 Occupy Wall Street movement. Despite widespread public and left-leaning Labour Party support for targeting banks, the article argues that such a tax would be unjustified, counterproductive, and economically harmful. First, banks did not experience a true windfall\u2014interest rates peaked at just over 5%, which is historically moderate. Second, bank profitability remains low, with return on equity near 10%, far below sectors like technology and pharmaceuticals. Third, banks already pay higher taxes: a 0.1% balance sheet levy and a 3% supertax on top of the standard 25% corporation tax, resulting in an effective rate of 28%. The article warns that punishing banks undermines efforts to position the UK as a pro-business, pro-growth economy. It cites a decline in UK banks\u2019 market share in capital markets and advisory work\u2014from 36% in 2012 to 30% today\u2014compared to over 70% in the US and Japan. The article also notes lingering public distrust of banks, rooted in the 2008 crisis, where few executives faced legal consequences; for example, Tom Hayes, wrongfully imprisoned for Libor manipulation, was later cleared by the Supreme Court and is now suing UBS for $400 million. The piece concludes by highlighting the irony that a wealthy former banker now aligns with populist critics of banking, despite ideological differences.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/b5708992-7c0e-46c2-a277-c99056d1df8f)\n\n**'Bribery and Inspection Cover-Up' at Major Shipbuilder: 1st-Degree Sentences for Safety Officer and Supplier Representative**\nA senior safety officer at a major South Korean shipbuilding company was sentenced to one year in prison by Seoul Northern District Court's Criminal Division 13 on November 3, 2025, for accepting bribes and covering up safety inspections. The defendant, Kim M., 54, was accused of receiving approximately 78 million won from a cooperating company's de facto representative, Son M., 28, in exchange for facilitating safety rule violations and providing unfair advantages to the supplier. The prosecution had requested a three-year prison sentence and a fine of 78,024,278 won for Kim, and a six-month prison term for Son. However, the court imposed a suspended sentence of two years for Son, citing his cooperation, lack of prior criminal record, and the fact that he was already detained on separate organized crime charges, which prevented the full 300 million won bribe from being paid. The court emphasized that Kim, as the actual on-site safety manager, failed in his duty, significantly increasing the risk of workplace accidents. The court considered mitigating factors such as Kim\u2019s admission of guilt, remorse, his family\u2019s poor health, and his spouse\u2019s tax arrears. Son also engaged in similar misconduct with another company employee, Woo M., 49, providing around 27.14 million won in illicit benefits through improper requests related to inspection cover-ups and subcontracting. Woo was sentenced to one year in prison with a three-year suspended sentence and ordered to repay 27.14 million won; he has appealed the decision. The shipbuilder had previously implemented a zero-tolerance policy for safety violations and prohibited employees from accepting improper benefits following a series of fatal accidents during shipbuilding operations.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 01:50 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20251103_0003387446)\n\n**Court Orders Immediate Detention of All Private Developers in Daegwallyeong Scandal, Warns of Legal Inequity from Embezzlement Charge Abolition**\nThe Seoul Central District Court's Criminal Division 22 (Presiding Judge Jo Hyo-woo) delivered first-instance verdicts in the embezzlement case involving private developers tied to the Daegwallyeong project, sentencing all defendants to immediate detention. The court emphasized that, despite ongoing legislative discussions on abolishing the embezzlement offense, the law currently remains in effect, and thus courts must apply existing statutory law in sentencing. The court noted that abolishing the embezzlement charge could lead to significant legal inequity, as cases already prosecuted might be dismissed regardless of guilt, depending on the timing of legal reform. This warning came amid heightened public interest in whether the abolition of the embezzlement charge\u2014announced in the government and ruling party's 'First Phase of Economic Punishment Rationalization' on September 30, 2024\u2014would result in the immediate dismissal ('acquittal') of President Lee Jae-myung\u2019s case, which is based on the same embezzlement allegations. Sentences included: Yu Dong-gyu, former head of the planning department at Seongnam Urban Development Corporation, received 8 years in prison, a fine of 400 million KRW, and restitution of 810 million KRW; Jung Min-young, a lawyer and former head of the investment division, received 6 years in prison, a fine of 3.8 billion KRW, and restitution of 3.722 billion KRW; Kim Man-bae, CEO of Hwachon Dae-u Asset Management, received 8 years in prison and restitution of 4.28 billion KRW; Nam Uk, owner of Cheonhwa Dong-in, received 4 years in prison; and Jung Young-hak, an accountant, received 5 years in prison. The court\u2019s remarks underscored concerns over legal fairness and the potential for inconsistent outcomes if the embezzlement charge is abolished without a clear transitional framework.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/1226892.html)\n\n**Former ES Officer admits to federal crimes - Shore Daily News**\nFormer Eastville Police Officer Jerry Keith Brady Jr., 39, admitted to one count each of wire fraud and money laundering in U.S. District Court in Norfolk, as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutor Lindsey Halligan. The charges stemmed from a scheme between November 2020 and November 2024, during which Brady defrauded 13 victims of $831,250 across 33 transactions. He falsely claimed the funds were needed to cover attorney\u2019s fees, taxes, or other expenses tied to an inheritance or life insurance proceeds from deceased relatives, promising repayment once the funds arrived\u2014though no such funds existed. According to a signed statement, Brady used the money for personal expenses, including gambling at casinos, online sports betting apps, and skill machines in Eastern Shore gas stations. The original indictment included 12 counts of wire fraud and two of money laundering, involving nearly $820,000. Under the plea deal, the remaining charges will be dismissed after sentencing, scheduled for February 2026. The maximum penalties are 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for wire fraud, and 10 years in prison for money laundering\u2014though sentences were not specified in the agreement. Brady also agreed to a restitution order for the full amount of victims\u2019 losses, forfeiture of assets, and full cooperation in financial investigations, including providing tax returns from the past five years.

According to former prosecutor Adri\u00e1n Vega, who serves as legal advisor to the municipality, funds designated exclusively for education were diverted to health and central administration accounts, constituting financial mismanagement. The investigation targets individuals who served as general secretaries, finance chiefs, and officials in the Department of Education and Control, including Patricio Bacho, Ernesto Velasco, Jorge D\u00edaz, and Sandra Castro. Vega emphasized that these actions represent an abusive exercise in managing public funds, with knowledge of the misuse expected from those involved. The case includes over 360 million pesos in contested funds and reveals that officials were paid via honorarium invoices for services at schools where directors confirmed they did not know the individuals. Additionally, Mario Fern\u00e1ndez S\u00e1nchez, legal representative of Servicios T\u00e9cnicos TELMAR SpA, faces charges of fraud, falsification of documents, and illicit association, with crimes considered consummated and repeated. Vega noted that while improper administration carries a maximum penalty of five years and disqualifications, tax fraud is more serious and can result in up to ten years in prison, especially with repeated offenses. The municipality\u2019s debt exceeds 83 billion pesos, prompting the board and Mayor Daniel Norambuena to approve the definitive closure of the corporation and the transfer of the Department of Health to the municipality within one to two months. Norambuena called for public apologies from responsible parties and stated that administrative reforms have been implemented, with plans to create an organizational chart and collaborate with unions to ensure proper management and oversight of public tenders. The report revealed a pattern of misconduct, including 95 fake invoices and ghost workers who allegedly received nearly one billion pesos in 2023 for non-existent services in the Health Department, mirroring practices previously seen in the Education Department.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 05:43 AM\nSource:[diariolaregion.cl](https://www.diariolaregion.cl/amplian-querella-contra-exalcalde-roberto-jacob-y-exdirectivos-de-la-corporacion-ggv/)\n\n**VW Share Price Rises as Another Major Diesel Scandal Trial Begins in November**\nA new major trial against five former Volkswagen employees began on November 17, 2025, in Braunschweig, with over 100 hearing days scheduled until the end of 2026. The defendants, including former VW executives, are accused of systematic fraud and other crimes related to the diesel emissions scandal, having allegedly deceived authorities and customers in Europe and the U.S. for years by manipulating diesel vehicle emissions data using hidden software. The fraudulent practices, which involved cleaner emissions during tests but significantly higher emissions in real-world driving, date back to at least 2006. This follows a previous landmark trial that concluded in May 2025 after nearly four years and 175 hearing days, resulting in guilty verdicts for four former executives\u2014two received prison sentences, two were given suspended sentences.

The charges, filed at the High Court in Accra, include stealing, money laundering, fraud by false pretences, intentionally causing financial loss to the Republic, misuse of public office for profit, and intentional dissipation of public funds. Under Section 124(1) of the Criminal Offences Act, 1960 (Act 29), stealing carries a maximum penalty of 25 years\u2019 imprisonment. Similarly, Section 179A(3)(a) of Act 29 imposes a maximum 25-year sentence for fraudulently causing financial loss to the Republic. Under Section 1(2)(c) of the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2020 (Act 1044), money laundering offences are punishable by severe custodial penalties and asset forfeiture. Section 179C(a) of Act 29 also allows for imprisonment, disqualification from public office, and confiscation of unlawfully acquired assets. The alleged misconduct occurred between 2017 and 2025, during which public funds meant for food supply contracts were diverted to private companies owned or controlled by the accused. Prosecutors state the offences caused a total financial loss exceeding GH\u00a265 million to the state. The case is expected to test Ghana\u2019s anti-corruption and asset recovery systems, with the State indicating its intent to pursue restitution and forfeiture if convictions are secured. Hearing dates have not yet been announced.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 08:41 AM\nSource:[MyJoyOnline.com](https://www.myjoyonline.com/ag-outlines-21-charges-against-former-nafco-ceo-faces-jail-terms-up-to-25-years/)\n\n**Ex-trader files $400M lawsuit against UBS over Libor manipulation scandal**\nTom Hayes, the former British trader convicted in the Libor manipulation scandal, has filed a $400 million lawsuit against UBS in Connecticut Superior Court, alleging 'malicious prosecution and corporate scapegoating.' According to court documents, Hayes claims UBS deliberately framed him as the mastermind of the scandal to shield senior executives and avoid criminal prosecution, despite the bank paying $1.5 billion in 2012 to settle regulatory charges across the U.S., U.K., and Switzerland. The complaint, dated October 23, 2025, asserts that UBS 'intentionally directed the destruction of an innocent man's life' by providing misleading information to prosecutors, making Hayes the 'perfect fall guy' in a 'carefully stage-managed' narrative. Hayes, who was arrested in 2012, convicted in 2015, and released from prison in 2021 after serving over five years of an 11-year sentence, claims the internal investigation was 'fundamentally flawed' and seeks damages for reputational, professional, and personal losses. On the same day, Hayes also filed a similar suit in New York state court. His legal team stated that it has taken over a decade to overturn his wrongful conviction, and now UBS is being held accountable. The U.S. charges against Hayes were later dropped. The Libor scandal, which emerged after the 2008 financial crisis, led to nearly $10 billion in global fines and the eventual phase-out of Libor in 2021.

The lawsuit, filed in Connecticut, USA, alleges that UBS misrepresented Hayes as the 'bad mastermind' behind the financial scandal to protect itself from legal consequences. Hayes, 46, was convicted in 2015 in the UK to 14 years in prison, but in August 2025, the UK Supreme Court overturned his conviction, ruling that the jury had been improperly instructed and the trial was unfair. Although the court found 'plentiful evidence' still supporting a conviction, it concluded the process lacked fairness. Hayes claims UBS knew his conduct aligned with internal bank practices widely accepted within the institution. According to the complaint, UBS deliberately portrayed him as the sole culprit to secure a reduced penalty for itself. UBS had previously settled with regulators in Switzerland, the US, and the UK in 2012, agreeing to pay 1.4 billion Swiss francs in fines\u2014amounts Hayes and his lawyers argue would have been higher had he not been scapegoated. The UBS declined to comment on the lawsuit. The Libor scandal, which emerged in 2012, involved multiple global banks, including Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and JP Morgan, in manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate, a key benchmark for financial products like mortgages and loans.

His lawyers argue in the complaint that Hayes was made a 'select scapegoat' by UBS, and that despite clearing his name, the bank's actions irreparably destroyed his life. The Libor benchmark, which influenced over $350 trillion in financial instruments including mortgages, swaps, and credit card rates, was manipulated for decades. A global investigation led by the U.S. Department of Justice resulted in nearly $10 billion in fines against a dozen banks and brokerages. The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) initially secured nine convictions but now considers most of them unsafe following a high-profile appeal. UBS was not a defendant in the SFO case; the bank declined to comment. Hayes' legal team claims UBS deliberately targeted him\u2014a high-profile yet mid-level employee\u2014to satisfy regulators while shielding top management. Hayes, who worked at UBS from 2006 to 2009 and reportedly generated around $300 million in profit for the bank, was paid over $3 million annually. After moving to Citigroup, he was barred from trading and fired in 2010. He was arrested in 2012, convicted in 2015 after appeal to an 11-year prison sentence, and released in 2021. Since then, he has fought to overturn the criminal narrative. In an interview, Hayes stated that UBS executives were aware of his actions and even rewarded him for influencing Libor to benefit the bank. He emphasized that the lawsuit is not about money but about preventing future injustice and deterring institutional scapegoating. UBS paid $1.5 billion to U.S., U.K., and Swiss regulators to settle investigations into interest rate manipulation, a sum that would have been higher had Swiss authorities not cooperated by handing Hayes over, according to his lawyers.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/banken-versicherungen/finanzmaerkte-tom-hayes-verklagt-ubs-auf400-millionen-dollar-wegen-libor-skandal/100169010.html)\n\n**Former UBS Trader Tom Hayes Sues Institution for $400 Million Over Libor Scandal**\nTom Hayes, the former UBS trader who became the public face of the global Libor manipulation scandal, has filed a $400 million (318 million Swiss francs) lawsuit against UBS.

Hayes alleges that UBS orchestrated a 'malicious prosecution' by portraying him as the 'evil mastermind' of the Libor-rigging scandal to deflect blame from senior executives. According to the complaint, UBS manipulated the legal narrative by designating Hayes as the 'perfect fall guy,' enabling the bank to avoid criminal charges while paying $1.5 billion in regulatory fines in December 2012. The complaint claims the process was 'carefully stage-managed' to shift attention from senior management, calling Hayes a 'hand-picked villain.' Hayes, 46, denies wrongdoing and asserts that UBS ruined his career, reputation, and health, seeking punitive damages. His conviction was overturned due to a judge's error in instructing jurors that banks could not consider commercial interests when setting Libor, which the Supreme Court ruled undermined trial fairness.

The lawsuit follows the UK Supreme Court's July 2025 decision to overturn Hayes's 2015 conviction for manipulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor), which had led to widespread prosecutions in the financial sector. Despite the acquittal, Hayes's legal team argues UBS's actions irreversibly destroyed his life. The Libor rate, used to price over $350 trillion in loans and securities, became central to a global investigation led by the U.S. Department of Justice, resulting in nearly $10 billion in fines across more than a dozen banks.

Lay died in July 2006, voiding his conviction; Skilling was initially sentenced to 24 years but later resentenced to 14 years.

Tom Hayes, a former Citigroup and UBS trader, and Carlo Palombo, who worked for Barclays, were accused of trying to influence the London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor) and its euro equivalent, Euribor, which were used to set interest rates on trillions of dollars in loans and other financial products worldwide. The court ruled that the convictions of Hayes and Palombo were unfair because the judges in their separate cases gave incorrect instructions to the juries, preventing them from considering the key question of whether the traders had acted dishonestly. 'That bad direction undermined the fairness of the trial,' wrote Judge George Leggatt in an 82-page decision supported by the five members of the panel that heard the case. Hayes was found guilty in August 2015 and sentenced to a maximum of 14 years in prison, which was later reduced to 11 years. Palombo, found guilty in March 2019, was sentenced to four years in prison. Both men were released in 2021. 'It destroyed my family, I missed out on most of my son's childhood,' Hayes told the BBC. 'I've been an international fugitive for so long... and now I can try to move on with my life,' he added. The decision came after the US 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the convictions of two traders accused of similar crimes in the US in 2022. Hayes and Palombo, whose appeals were repeatedly rejected by British judges, were allowed to take their case to the UK Supreme Court after that ruling. The UK Serious Fraud Office began investigating suspected attempts to manipulate Libor in 2012, which ultimately led to the conviction of nine bankers.

The UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has decided to drop the case, stating that it would not be in the public interest to pursue a new trial at this stage. Hayes was initially sentenced to 14 years in prison, but had his sentence reduced to 11 years on appeal and was released early in 2021. The SFO accused Hayes of orchestrating a scheme with traders from UBS, Citigroup, and other banks to manipulate the Libor rate from 2006 to 2010. Hayes had argued that manipulating the rate was 'common practice' in the financial industry, and his lawyers also claimed that he suffered from Asperger's syndrome. The case was examined alongside that of Carlo Palombo, who was sentenced to 4 years in prison in 2019 for manipulating the Euribor rate. The UK's Court of Appeal had previously upheld the convictions, but the Supreme Court's decision has now overturned them.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 11:09 AM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/fr/infos/international/la-condamnation-d-un-ex-trader-d-ubs-annul-e-londres-2796234.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a variety of expert perspectives\u2014ranging from forensic accounting and law to sociology and political science\u2014most forecasters assign a very low probability (1-5%) that a senior executive of a major public company will be imprisoned for corporate crimes before January 1, 2026. Their consensus is shaped by several recurring themes: (1) the historical base rate since Enron is extremely low, with nearly all major cases in the US, UK, and Europe resulting in settlements, fines, or scapegoating of lower-level employees; (2) recent high-profile executive convictions (e.g., Tom Hayes, Carlo Palombo of LIBOR) have been overturned, further reducing the pool of qualifying imprisonments; (3) the extremely short time window remaining (less than 2 months) makes new convictions and commencement of prison sentences for senior executives unlikely due to lengthy appeals and legal delays; (4) even in current cases such as the Volkswagen diesel scandal, it is unclear from public news whether imprisoned individuals qualify as 'senior executives' or whether their sentences have actually begun. While a few experts (notably from institutional corruption and legal jurisprudence perspectives) assign a higher probability (up to 92% and 25%, respectively) owing to the May 2025 conviction and sentencing of four former VW executives (two to prison terms), most are skeptical that the news satisfies the stringent definition of 'senior executive' or confirms sentence commencement. The majority view is that barring surprising new evidence or overlooked details, the answer is almost certainly 'No'\u2014with slight, not absolute, room for error due to possible edge cases in the VW trial. The expert consensus underlines persistent structural and procedural barriers to executive-level accountability in major corporations.",
