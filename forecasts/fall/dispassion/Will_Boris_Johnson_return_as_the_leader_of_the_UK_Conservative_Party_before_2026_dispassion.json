Alternatives to Badenoch (e.g., Jenrick) are far more plausible as next leaders. There is no evidence in the news that any Johnson restoration movement is gaining traction.

The party is also wary of further leadership instability, which would be exacerbated by a dramatic Johnson comeback. The time remaining (under two months) is also a significant logistical barrier. There is no evidence of a movement or mechanism to reinstate Johnson, and he has not signaled any interest. While extreme political volatility exists, and the Tories are in deep crisis, the only plausible scenario for a Johnson return is a total party meltdown and a desperation move\u2014yet even in that scenario, the barriers are high and alternatives more likely.

The explicit, repeated repudiation of Johnson\u2019s legacy at both the parliamentary and grassroots levels, as well as the technical and reputational barriers to his return, are entirely consistent with the party\u2019s historical pattern of seeking fresh faces in the aftermath of scandal or electoral collapse. The emphasis on time constraints and the absence of a serious movement to reinstall Johnson further strengthens this view. Party System Theory correctly predicts that even in existential crises, parties seek solutions that maximize plausibility and minimize risk, favoring untainted insiders or caretakers over disgraced ex-leaders.

The emphasis on the party's need to reassure donors and the public, and the lack of any viable mechanism for Johnson's return given his MP status, are key insights that are sometimes overlooked in more scenario-driven approaches. The diagnosis that even in dire straits, the party would opt for a more plausible caretaker or insider aligns with both leadership succession theory and the historical record of the Conservative Party.

By integrating both the top-down (elite) and bottom-up (grassroots) perspectives, this approach adds nuance: even in a crisis, the absence of stakeholder momentum and the presence of reputational risk create strong path-dependency toward alternatives. The news strongly supports this mapping: repeated leadership churn, focus on donor stabilization, and explicit distancing from Johnson.

While the forecaster rightly notes that a Johnson return would require a 'multi-layered crisis' and elimination of all other options, the analysis might overstate the plausibility of such a scenario by not sufficiently emphasizing the procedural and cultural hurdles (e.g., Johnson not being an MP, the necessity for rapid elite coordination, and the lack of a membership surge in his favor). From a British Studies perspective, the forecast could more strongly stress that, even in unprecedented party meltdowns, the institutional inertia and risk-aversion of Westminster parties almost always militate against reinstating a recently ousted, scandal-damaged leader.

The explicit observation that these principal actors are actively moving to distance the party from Johnson\u2014rather than mobilizing for his return\u2014aligns with the elite-driven logic of party renewal and damage control. Furthermore, the mapping of stakeholder sentiment validates the argument that, even in systemic crisis, parties will seek to minimize further instability and reputational harm.

Additional discussion further emphasized the deep institutional, procedural, and reputational barriers, with no evidence of elite or grassroots momentum for Johnson. Critiques of more scenario-driven approaches highlight that even extreme crisis does not plausibly overcome these barriers within the remaining time window. No new evidence or overlooked scenario emerged in deliberation that would justify increasing the probability above the initial estimate, nor is there any credible reason to drop it to literal zero given the nonzero possibility of black-swan events.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\n[Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson), born 19 June 1964, is a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Leader of the Conservative Party from 2019 to 2022. He previously served as Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs from 2016 to 2018 and as Mayor of London from 2008 to 2016. Johnson has been Member of Parliament (MP) for Uxbridge and South Ruislip since 2015, having previously been MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008.\n\nIn 2022, Johnson resigned the leadership of the Conservative Party subsequent to [a wave of resignations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_Kingdom_government_crisis) from his cabinet and government, following numerous scandals. Following a leadership contest, he was succeeded in September 2022 by Liz Truss.\n\nHowever, there is speculation that should Truss fare poorly as leader, she may be replaced swiftly, and Johnson may make a comeback. As of September 26, 2022, [according to betting exchange Smarkets](https://twitter.com/SmarketsPol/status/1574408957124386818):\n\n>Boris Johnson is now second favourite to be the next Prime Minister \u2014 behind only Keir Starmer \u2014 suggesting that in the event Liz Truss goes before the next election, Johnson would be favourite to take over.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":12613,\"question_id\":12613}}`",

An acting or caretaker leadership of the party that is intended to be temporary, e.g. during a leadership contest, does not count; he must formally be the leader of the party.

The article claims she is preparing to break Labour\u2019s manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, VAT, or National Insurance, potentially increasing the basic rate by 2p\u2014marking the first rise in 50 years\u2014while also proposing to extend the six-year freeze on tax thresholds, which would push millions into higher tax brackets. The Resolution Foundation, a think tank with ties to former Labour ministers, stated that tax increases totaling around \u00a326 billion are 'inevitable'. Reeves is considering a partial offset via a 2p National Insurance cut, but the net effect would still raise \u00a36 billion annually, including from pensioners. Downing Street has not confirmed whether Labour\u2019s tax pledge remains valid. Conservative leaders, including Sir Mel Stride and Kemi Badenoch, have urged Prime Minister Keir Starmer to sack Reeves if she breaks her promises, with Stride calling her first Budget a 'failure' and accusing her of lacking 'backbone'. Starmer, speaking to Labour MPs, attributed the fiscal crisis to 'Tory austerity, their botched Brexit deal, and the pandemic', arguing that tough but 'fair' decisions are necessary. Reeves blamed the previous Conservative government and Brexit for the current state of the economy, while the article highlights her prior claims\u2014made seven times\u2014that she would not raise taxes. The article also notes that her first Budget introduced a \u00a325 billion 'jobs tax' on employers, which may have contributed to economic stagnation. Despite pressure, Starmer refused to launch a formal investigation into the licensing controversy. The article concludes with a warning from Reform Party leader Nigel Farage that the UK could face 'economic collapse' within two years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 12:01 AM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15255067/Rachel-Reeves-hiding-Budget-betrayal.html)\n\n**Badenoch: Tories nearly went bankrupt after election defeat**\nKemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party, revealed that the party nearly went bankrupt after its worst-ever election defeat in 2024, during which it lost 250 seats to Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party. She attributed the financial crisis to major donors considering withdrawing funding following Rishi Sunak\u2019s defeat. In a BBC interview on the Newscast podcast, Badenoch admitted she had been 'working furiously behind the scenes' to stabilize the party\u2019s finances, stating, 'Without money, a party can't survive.' She explained that securing donor support consumed much of her time in the year following the election, limiting her public presence. Despite criticism for inactivity, she noted that since July 2024, Conservative fundraising has improved significantly\u2014raising \u00a32.9 million in the latest quarter, \u00a3300,000 more than Labour and \u00a31.5 million more than Reform UK. Badenoch also discussed her evolving approach to Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, describing it as 'like a panto' rather than a courtroom cross-examination, after initial sessions failed to resonate. She dismissed speculation about a leadership challenge from Robert Jenrick, who is expected to run after her policy review concludes. At the 2025 Conservative Party conference, she announced a pledge to scrap stamp duty at the next general election, a move praised by economists but criticized by Labour as 'unfunded.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/badenoch-tories-nearly-went-bankrupt-193227867.html)\n\n**'Labour will be wiped out without reset': reaction to historic Caerphilly defeat - LabourList**\nWelsh Labour suffered a historic defeat in the Caerphilly by-election, falling to third place, with party leader and First Minister Eluned Morgan acknowledging the result as a reflection of public frustration over the pace of change, stating, 'We take our share of responsibility for this result. We are listening, we are learning the lessons and we will come back stronger.' Cabinet minister Nick Thomas-Symonds and MP Nick Ferrari echoed this sentiment, citing widespread doorstep feedback that people want faster change. While Plaid Cymru\u2019s Dawn Bowden welcomed the rejection of 'hate and division' from Reform, she called the result a 'disappointing night' and expressed condolences over the passing of Hefin David, whose death triggered the by-election. Left-wing group Momentum condemned the loss as an 'existential threat' to Labour\u2019s future, accusing the government of failing to tax the wealthy and stifling internal dissent under Keir Starmer and McSweeney. Centre-left group Mainstream called the defeat a 'tragedy, but not a surprise,' warning that Labour will be 'wiped out in Wales next May without a major reset' unless it reclaims its democratic socialist foundations and offers a practical, principled left-wing vision. Welsh commentator Richard Martin criticized Welsh Labour\u2019s social media strategy\u2014highlighting a childlike rose drawing, a TikTok with George Michael\u2019s 'Father Figure,' and misleading bar charts\u2014as unprofessional and damaging to credibility. Pollster Peter Kellner noted that tactical voting likely prevented a Reform victory, suggesting Reform may be near its national ceiling at around 35%, and that progressive tactical voting could block Reform in future contests. Despite the loss, LabourList reported that only one in four members want Keir Starmer to resign if Labour loses the 2026 Senedd election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[labourlist.org](https://labourlist.org/2025/10/labour-reaction-caerphilly-senedd-by-election-defeat/)\n\n**Dangerous days ahead for the UK Conservatives**\nThe UK Conservative Party faces a critical political crisis as voter allegiance shifts, Reform UK gains momentum, and the party's credibility erodes. Despite a historically strong record\u2014having been in power for 49 of the 80 years since WWII and producing three female prime ministers, including Rishi Sunak, the first non-white PM, and current leader Kemi Badenoch, a Black woman born in England to Nigerian parents\u2014the party now trails in polls with only 17% support, down from 24% in the 2024 general election. Reform UK has surged to 31%, while Labour has dropped to 21%. The article attributes this shift to Reform\u2019s successful capture of the Conservative base, particularly on issues like uncontrolled immigration and energy policy. Both the Conservatives and the current Labour government have failed to stem the flow of small boat arrivals from France, a situation that undermines national sovereignty and fuels public concern. Additionally, the UK\u2019s electricity costs are the highest in the G7, driven by renewable subsidies and the legally binding 'net zero by 2050' target, which critics\u2014including energy expert Vaclav Smil\u2014label as delusional. Although the Conservatives have begun to back away from the net zero mandate, their credibility is questioned: voters may see this as tactical repositioning rather than genuine policy reversal. The article concludes that, barring unforeseen developments, the next general election in 2029 could mark the end of the Conservative Party\u2019s dominance, as disillusionment with 14 years in office, potential leadership transformation under Badenoch, and doubts about Reform\u2019s governance capacity remain unresolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[westcentralcrossroads.ca](https://westcentralcrossroads.ca/politicslaw/dangerous-days-ahead-for-the-uk-conservatives/)\n\n**Calls for by-election as MP defects to Reform**\nDanny Kruger, the Conservative MP for East Wiltshire, defected to Reform UK, prompting calls for a by-election from local Conservative leaders and opposition parties. Richard Clewer, leader of the Conservative group on Wiltshire Council, expressed disappointment, noting Kruger was elected as a Conservative less than a year prior and criticizing Reform UK\u2019s fiscal policies, including an \u00a380 billion budget shortfall, which he said contradicts Kruger\u2019s fiscally conservative stance. Brian Burchfield, chairman of the Melksham and Devizes Conservative Association, echoed this sentiment, calling Reform UK a 'privately-run party' focused on private interest and advocating higher taxes and welfare spending. Both urged Kruger to resign and allow a by-election so constituents could choose their representative based on the party they originally voted for. Reform UK welcomed Kruger\u2019s move, with group leader Ed Rimmer stating the party is now better positioned to form the next government and that Kruger will lead a new Department for Preparing for Government. Ian Thorn, Liberal Democrat leader of Wiltshire Council, said he was unsurprised by the defection and criticized Kruger for letting down voters. Oliver Lang, chair of the East Wiltshire Labour Party, accused Kruger of self-interest and opportunism, emphasizing that Labour is ready to represent the constituency with a focus on housing, transport, and health services.

A senior Labour source stated that discussions about Starmer\u2019s leadership are now widespread across the party, with the focus shifting from 'when' he should go to 'who' could replace him. Some MPs are assessing potential candidates, including Health Secretary Wes Streeting, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, former Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner (despite her recent resignation over tax affairs), and even a potential comeback by former party leader Ed Miliband. A 'stalking horse' candidate\u2014someone who runs to trigger a formal leadership contest\u2014would need support from 80 MPs to stand. While some believe a senior MP standing down at the next election might serve as the stalking horse to force a contest, others hope for a 'coronation'\u2014a leadership shortlist of one leader and deputy\u2014to avoid a full ballot. Streeting backers are pushing for a left-wing deputy, such as Rayner, to counter perceptions he is too 'Blairite'. However, party insiders suggest Rayner may run her own leadership bid, with one MP describing her resignation speech as 'I am still in the race and I will get my own back.' Reeves is reportedly under scrutiny, with one MP calling her 'badly damaged' and 'a disaster,' and suggesting Starmer is keeping her to absorb blame for the Budget. The same MP added that Starmer might replace her with a new Chancellor in the New Year if he remains in office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15249523/Labour-MPs-plotting-oust-Starmer.html)\n\n**Kemi Badenoch has six months to save the Tories - and her leadership, MPs warn**\nKemi Badenoch, leader of the Conservative Party since 2024, has been warned by senior Tory sources that she has six months to reverse the party\u2019s declining fortunes or face a leadership challenge, with Robert Jenrick seen as the likely successor. Despite positive reactions to her recent Prime Minister\u2019s Questions performances and a well-received conference speech\u2014where she announced policies like abolishing stamp duty\u2014her leadership has failed to improve the party\u2019s historically low polling, which remains stagnant at around 17%, unchanged from before her speech and down from 24% when she took office. Critics accuse her of retreating after the conference, likening her to a 'hedgehog' in hibernation and describing her as 'the living dead' with 'everybody waiting for the end.' Some MPs fear that delaying a leadership change until May may be too late, as Reform UK continues to attract defectors, including high-profile figures like Danny Kruger and Sir Jake Berry, along with dozens of councillors. While some Conservative MPs support a leadership change to counter Reform\u2019s rise, others warn that another leadership shift\u2014her fifth since 2019\u2014could make the party appear unstable and alienate voters. Pollster Robert Hayward noted improved recognition of Badenoch among Tory voters (51% approval in a YouGov poll), but Professor Sir John Curtice emphasized that this is not translating into broader popularity, with 'for every voter who likes her there is one who does not.' He advised her to disown Boris Johnson and Liz Truss to improve credibility, especially given her focus on the economy. Meanwhile, a secret memo revealed that Conservative Campaign Headquarters lacks contact information for 131 of 600 association parties, indicating a breakdown in grassroots engagement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 07:01 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/kemi-badenoch-tory-leadership-jenrick-conservative-b2856232.html)\n\n**Tories Clash with Starmer Over Tax Rises, Stamp Duty and Deportation Failures in Fiery PMQs**\nIn a heated Prime Minister\u2019s Questions (PMQs) session on November 1, 2025, Kemi Badenoch and senior Conservatives accused Keir Starmer of having 'no plan for growth' and urged him to abolish stamp duty instead of raising taxes ahead of the upcoming Budget. Badenoch claimed Labour\u2019s approach relies solely on higher taxes, criticizing the government for taxing work, saving, and homes. She called for scrapping stamp duty to help young people enter the housing market. Shadow financial secretary Gareth Davies echoed the sentiment, accusing Starmer of being 'out of ideas before his first year is up.' Starmer rejected the claims, blaming the Conservatives for a 'decade and a half of economic failure,' citing Brexit, austerity, and the Truss mini-Budget as major contributors to economic damage. He pointed to upgraded economic growth forecasts and strong stock market performance as evidence that Labour\u2019s plan is working, though he declined to repeat Labour\u2019s 2024 election pledge not to raise income tax, National Insurance, or VAT, stating that no Prime Minister or Chancellor sets out plans before a Budget. Pressed on the inconsistency with his earlier July 2025 statement, Starmer maintained that Rachel Reeves\u2019s November 26 statement would outline a long-term plan for stability and growth. The session was overshadowed by migration controversies: Hadush Kebatu, a 41-year-old Ethiopian man convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old, was mistakenly released from prison and recaptured after a two-day manhunt; he was later deported after being paid \u00a3500 to comply. Additionally, a Channel migrant deported under the 'one in, one out' policy returned to Britain by small boat after skipping a shelter in Paris. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood acknowledged the operational failure but defended the intent. Starmer also addressed Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, expressing concern and supporting President Trump\u2019s peace plan, while condemning Reform UK as 'Putin-friendly' and a threat to Western unity. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey raised concerns about Russian interference, and Labour MP Janet Daby highlighted a surge in knife crime in Lewisham, urging stronger community protection measures. Starmer praised Labour\u2019s bans on 'zombie knives' and online sales controls, which Conservatives opposed. The exchange underscored a deepening divide over tax policy, economic direction, and migration, with both sides preparing for a high-stakes Budget and the next general election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 04:35 PM\nSource:[leamingtonobserver.co.uk](https://leamingtonobserver.co.uk/news/tories-clash-with-starmer-over-tax-rises-stamp-duty-and-deportation-failures-in-fiery-pmqs-58738/)\n\n**Express readers decide whether Liz Truss should make a comeback**\nLiz Truss, the shortest-serving UK prime minister in history with a tenure of 49 days in 2022, remains a prominent figure in British politics. She assumed office in September 2022 following Boris Johnson's resignation, winning the Conservative leadership contest with promises of tax cuts and economic growth. Her premiership became infamous due to the 'mini-budget' introduced by Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, which triggered market turmoil, a sharp decline in the pound, and rising mortgage rates. Within weeks, Kwarteng was dismissed, and Truss resigned shortly after. Despite the fallout, she defended her economic vision as necessary for long-term growth in Britain's stagnant economy. Truss, who was MP for South West Norfolk since 2010, lost her seat in the 2024 General Election. Now out of office, she told The Express's podcast, The Daily Expresso, that she remains 'still busy' focusing on 'how we actually make Britain a successful country' and 'how do we get out of the morass that we're in'. Public opinion, as reflected in a reader poll by the Express, is divided on whether she should make a political comeback, with some arguing her free-market and growth-oriented policies deserve a second chance amid ongoing economic stagnation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:11 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/2127333/poll-should-liz-truss-make-a-comeback)\n\n**Kemi Badenoch to clash with Keir Starmer with Farage set for fresh protest**\nKemi Badenoch, the Conservative Party leader, is set to confront Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) in the House of Commons, amid heightened controversy over the UK government's economic and immigration policies. Badenoch highlighted a recent fatal stabbing in Uxbridge, where an Afghan national who entered the UK illegally was arrested on suspicion of murder and child assault, stating, 'This man, granted asylum in Britain, has been arrested on suspicion of murdering an innocent person and violently attacking a child.' She is also expected to challenge Starmer on Labour's decision to block the release of documents related to the collapsed China spy case, which she criticized as 'on their watch.' Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage may repeat his previous protest by sitting in the public gallery to object to not being granted a weekly question at PMQs.

Despite having no actual government experience\u2014only having written speeches for David Cameron and briefly served as Boris Johnson\u2019s political secretary\u2014Kruger is portrayed as being presented to the public as a 'safe pair of hands' with governing expertise. The article, written by John Crace for The Guardian, critically examines Kruger\u2019s credibility, highlighting contradictions in his claims, such as asserting that the civil service grew by 30% post-Brexit due to increased administrative work, while ignoring his own role in Brexit\u2019s administrative burden. Kruger also proposed discontinuing leases of five Whitehall departments (a move already promised by Labour), establishing a non-functional 'secret phone line' for reporting government waste, and advocating for a return to a 'God-fearing' society with traditional family values, while opposing LGBTQ+ rights and the DEI agenda. The piece also critiques Reform\u2019s stance on Sarah Pochin, who is defended as guilty only of 'accidental racism,' and underscores the irony of Kruger lecturing on good governance given the poor performance of Reform-led councils. The article concludes with skepticism about Kruger\u2019s self-perception, questioning whether he is delusional or simply dismissive of public intelligence.

The poll results fuel speculation that Starmer may face a leadership challenge before the May local elections, which could result in severe losses for Labour. Although party rules prevent MPs from removing the leader\u2014elected directly by members\u2014Starmer could step down if the parliamentary Labour Party views him as a liability. In July, Starmer led Farage by eight percentage points, but the gap has now closed. A separate YouGov poll reveals Labour has reached its lowest-ever polling level at 17%, trailing UK Reform by 10 points and leading the Greens by just one. The sharp campaign by Farage on immigration and crime, combined with a lackluster Labour conference and concerns over upcoming tax increases, has contributed to Starmer\u2019s declining support. Farage\u2019s net approval rating dropped by 3.5 points to -40, while Badenoch\u2019s rose by 1.5 points to -22, and Farage\u2019s popularity increased by 1.5 points to -9. The poll, based on over 1,100 adults, also found Farage now leads Starmer by three percentage points in the prime minister preference question, and Starmer\u2019s lead over Badenoch has narrowed from 12 to five points since last month.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/10/28/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%B6%D9%84%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%89-%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84/7175810)\n\n**Fresh poll woe for Keir Starmer as voters now prefer Nigel Farage as PM for the first time - and Labour's popularity slumps to record low to put them just one point ahead of Greens | Daily Mail Online**\nA YouGov voting intention survey revealed that Labour's support has plummeted to a record low of 17%, the lowest ever recorded for the party, while the Greens reached their highest-ever support at 16%. In an Ipsos poll, Nigel Farage was preferred as Prime Minister by 33% of voters, surpassing Keir Starmer, who was favored by 30%. This marks the first time Farage has led Starmer in a PM preference poll. The decline follows Labour's defeat in the Caerphilly by-election, where they came third behind Plaid Cymru and Reform UK, ending a 26-year hold on the seat. The loss has intensified speculation about a potential leadership challenge against Starmer, especially with the next local elections and Senedd/Scottish Parliament elections approaching in May 2026. Among former Labour voters, 18% now support the Greens, 13% the Liberal Democrats, and 11% Reform UK. The Greens have experienced a surge in membership, now exceeding 150,000, making them the UK's third-largest party by membership size, behind only Labour and Reform UK. This growth follows the election of 'eco-populist' Zack Polanski as their new leader. A senior Labour source stated that while a leadership challenge lacks sufficient MP backing, the Caerphilly result has heightened internal panic.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[dailymail.co.uk](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15233851/Fresh-blow-Keir-Starmer-Labour-slumps-record-poll-low-just-one-point-ahead-Greens.html)\n\n**Dominic Cummings says Nigel Farage will be Britain's next PM**\nDominic Cummings, former chief adviser to Boris Johnson, has predicted that Nigel Farage will become the UK's next Prime Minister if he can build a capable team beyond being a 'one man band with an iPhone.' Cummings stated that if Farage succeeds in assembling a strong team by the time of the next local elections, he would be the clear favorite and even expressed he would vote for him. However, Cummings warned that without such a team, Farage would 'implode' upon encountering Whitehall. In a critical interview, Cummings labeled Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer as 'completely rubbish at politics' and an 'NPC PM,' suggesting he could be replaced by Ed Miliband or Angela Rayner by next year. He dismissed Tory leader Kemi Badenoch as a 'disaster' and claimed her party is 'already past the event horizon' and facing extinction. Cummings also rejected any possibility of Boris Johnson's political comeback, citing his role in the 'Partygate' scandal. He criticized Labour\u2019s handling of the migrant crisis and the economy, declaring the 'British state is broken,' and called for deploying the Royal Navy to stop migrant boats and for dismantling the civil service's foundational structures, including the Cabinet Office. Despite his fiery political commentary, Cummings stated he no longer wants to return to politics, saying 'No one wants me back and I don't want to go back.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:19 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15204053/Dominic-Cummings-Nigel-Farage-Prime-Minister-build-right-team.html)\n\n**Dangerous days ahead for the UK Conservatives**\nThe UK Conservative Party faces a critical political crisis as voter allegiance shifts, Reform UK gains momentum, and the party's credibility erodes. Despite a historically strong record\u2014having been in power for 49 of the 80 years since WWII and producing three female prime ministers, including Rishi Sunak, the first non-white PM, and current leader Kemi Badenoch, a Black woman born in England to Nigerian parents\u2014the party now trails in polls with only 17% support, down from 24% in the 2024 general election. Reform UK has surged to 31%, while Labour has dropped to 21%. The article attributes this shift to Reform\u2019s successful capture of the Conservative base, particularly on issues like uncontrolled immigration and energy policy. Both the Conservatives and the current Labour government have failed to stem the flow of small boat arrivals from France, a situation that undermines national sovereignty and fuels public concern. Additionally, the UK\u2019s electricity costs are the highest in the G7, driven by renewable subsidies and the legally binding 'net zero by 2050' target, which critics\u2014including energy expert Vaclav Smil\u2014label as delusional. Although the Conservatives have begun to back away from the net zero mandate, their credibility is questioned: voters may see this as tactical repositioning rather than genuine policy reversal. The article concludes that, barring unforeseen developments, the next general election in 2029 could mark the end of the Conservative Party\u2019s dominance, as disillusionment with 14 years in office, potential leadership transformation under Badenoch, and doubts about Reform\u2019s governance capacity remain unresolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[westcentralcrossroads.ca](https://westcentralcrossroads.ca/politicslaw/dangerous-days-ahead-for-the-uk-conservatives/)\n\n**Who might be Britain's next prime minister?**\nA recent Ipsos survey found that only 13% of Britons expressed satisfaction with Sir Keir Starmer, the lowest rating for any UK prime minister since the question began in 1977. Despite holding a large parliamentary majority and not being required to call a general election until summer 2029, speculation is already underway about his potential successor. Sir Keir could resign voluntarily or be ousted via a Labour Party leadership challenge\u2014recent reports suggested Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, had been plotting a coup, though it failed to gain traction. A YouGov survey revealed that 53% of adults believe Starmer will not lead Labour into the next general election. Betfair, a gambling exchange, has received \u00a3300,000 in bets averaging \u00a35 each on the next prime minister, with Nigel Farage of Reform UK currently favored at a one-in-four chance. Wes Streeting, the health secretary, is now the top Labour contender with a one-in-seven chance, followed by Yvette Cooper (foreign secretary) and Shabana Mahmood (home secretary), whose odds are twice as long. Rachel Reeves (chancellor) and Kemi Badenoch (Conservative leader) are seen as unlikely candidates. According to the Economist\u2019s poll tracker, Labour trails Reform UK by ten points, but both polls and betting markets indicate a 50:50 chance of a hung Parliament in the next election, making the next occupant of 10 Downing Street highly uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 01:08 PM\nSource:[The Economist](https://www.economist.com/britain/2025/10/09/who-might-be-britains-next-prime-minister)\n\n**Badenoch survives her Tory conference test - but insiders warn she's still on borrowed time**\nKemi Badenoch survived the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, where speculation had mounted about her leadership viability amid low poll numbers and internal party dissent. Despite concerns\u2014fueled by Nigel Farage\u2019s lead in the polls and a visibly diminished conference turnout\u2014Badenoch delivered a strong performance, reaffirming Conservative values and pledging to scrap stamp duty on family homes, a move praised by both economists and activists. Robert Jenrick, her shadow Justice Secretary, bolstered her position with energetic appearances and viral content, though his past controversial remarks about race in Birmingham unsettled some Tories. While some senior figures admire his grassroots appeal, others liken him to Liz Truss, warning of similar political fallout. Badenoch\u2019s strategy focuses on repudiating the legacy of 14 years of Conservative rule\u2014particularly policies like the Climate Change Act and Human Rights Act\u2014and repositioning the party as fiscally responsible, with shadow Chancellor Sir Mel Stride proposing \u00a347bn in spending cuts. However, critics argue she lacks urgency and punch, and the party\u2019s shrinking conference presence\u2014marked by empty stands and self-run booths\u2014reflects deeper malaise. Fundraising has improved due to Badenoch\u2019s outreach to disaffected donors, but many remain hesitant, waiting to see if she can turn the party around. The next major test comes in May 2026, with local elections across England and devolved elections in Scotland and Wales, widely expected to be disastrous for the Tories. A senior party figure predicted she will face a leadership challenge regardless of the outcome, describing the current dynamic as a 'Mexican standoff'\u2014with no clear winner but no one willing to back down. Ultimately, many within the party doubt they can win the next general election, with one senior insider stating, 'I can't see us winning the next election,' and suggesting even past leaders like Boris Johnson or Margaret Thatcher would not be enough to reverse the tide.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/badenoch-tory-conference-test-but-borrowed-time-3966499)\n\n**Britain's storied Conservative party faces uncertain future**\nBritain's Conservative Party, once a dominant political force with leaders including Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and Benjamin Disraeli, faces an existential crisis as it concludes its annual conference in Manchester. The party, which governed for 18 years from 1979 to 1997 and 14 years from 2010 to 2024, has suffered a dramatic decline since the 2016 Brexit referendum, leading to the resignation of David Cameron and a succession of four leaders\u2014Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and others\u2014culminating in a historic defeat in the 2024 general election. The Conservatives were reduced to just 121 MPs, their worst result ever. Since then, the party has continued to lose ground to the hard-right Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, which has attracted defectors, including several former Tory MPs and councillors. A YouGov poll from September 2025 shows the Conservatives could be reduced to 45 MPs in the next election, placing them fourth behind the Liberal Democrats and just behind Reform UK, which could win a majority of 311 seats. Political scientist Robert Ford warns that the party's current situation is deeper than any in over a century, and that the rise of Reform leaves no time for rebuilding as in past defeats. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch is attempting to rally the party during her closing speech, proposing to leave the European Convention on Human Rights and deport 150,000 irregular migrants annually. However, many in Westminster speculate she may not survive to the next election. Ford cautions against a coalition with Reform, warning of a 'black widow spider effect'\u2014where the larger party consumes the smaller one.

Despite his departure, some Conservatives continued to admire his 2019 electoral success, which united former Labour heartlands with liberal voters in Middle England, fueling hopes of a potential return. However, under sustained criticism from Nigel Farage, who has popularized the term 'Boriswave' to describe the surge in non-EU immigration during Johnson\u2019s tenure, even his most loyal allies are distancing themselves from his legacy. At the 2025 Conservative Party conference, Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen acknowledged that the Conservative Party, including Johnson\u2019s leadership, made a mistake on migration, stating that the 'chickens have come home to roost' and contributed to Reform UK\u2019s political rise. Shadow Foreign Secretary Priti Patel, who served as home secretary under Johnson, confirmed that Conservatives are being held accountable for the 'Boriswave' of migration as the party faces increasing pressure from Reform UK.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 02:01 AM\nSource:[POLITICO](https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-uk-conservative-party-nigel-farage/)\n\n**Starmer becomes Britain's least popular prime minister in polling history**\nThe article reports that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s approval rating has fallen to a record low, with a new Ipsos poll showing only 13\u202f% of the public approving of his job as PM and 79\u202f% dissatisfied, giving him a net approval of \u201366.

The article also notes that only 22\u202f% of the public would vote for the Labour Party in a general election, while 34\u202f% would vote for Reform\u202fUK. A separate Survation poll of 1,254 Labour Party members (conducted 23\u201125\u202fSep) found that 53\u202f% want a new leader by the next election, 31\u202f% want Sir Keir to remain, 65\u202f% say he is heading in the wrong direction, 26\u202f% say he is heading right, over 60\u202f% say he has governed badly, and 35\u202f% say he has done a good job.

Among voters who chose Labour in the 2024 General Election, 67% would vote Labour again, 12% would choose Reform, 6% the Liberal Democrats, 6% the Green Party and 2% the Conservatives. Keir Starmer\u2019s approval rating fell to a net -42%, matching Rishi Sunak\u2019s lowest score and approaching Boris Johnson\u2019s net -44% after his government collapsed. Starmer\u2019s job approval is split: 41% approve and 39% disapprove. Only 23% of respondents think Starmer would make the best Prime Minister, compared with 13% for Kemi Badenoch; 52% say neither leader would be best. A majority (54%) of UK adults now believe Starmer should resign, including 34% of 2024 Labour voters, a figure higher than the 45% who called for Sunak\u2019s resignation in April 2024. The top replacement pick is Andy Burnham (13%) with a net acceptability of +12; Wes Streeting follows at 5% with -4. Kemi Badenoch has 48% support and 29% who think she should resign, with 33% wanting her to resign. James Cleverley and Robert Jenrick each receive 8% of the vote for Conservative leadership, while Priti Patel is the only candidate deemed negative (net -14).

Andy Burnham and Wes Streeting among bookies' favourites**\nPressure mounts on Sir Keir Starmer as Labour trails in polls amid scandals. Former front\u2011bencher Richard Burgon said it was 'inevitable' that the Prime Minister would be ousted if local elections in Scotland, Wales and parts of England go as badly as current polls predict. The article reports the departure of US Ambassador Lord Mandelson, deputy leader Angela Rayner, and Downing Street aide Paul Ovenden, who stepped down after 'sexually explicit' emails about MP Diane Abbott were unearthed. Starmer faces an electoral threat from Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which has overtaken Labour in many opinion polls and won a large number of council\u2011by elections since the 2024 general election. Bookmakers have Farage as the favourite to become Britain\u2019s next PM, but a coup could see a new Labour leader occupy Number 10 before the next general election. Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, is a bookmaker favourite at 8/1. He is not a sitting MP and would need to step down from his mayoral role to run in a parliamentary by\u2011election; allies say rumours are 'pure speculation with no substance'. Burnham has backing from Labour\u2019s benefits rebels and has publicly supported the soft\u2011left Labour network Mainstream, which calls for wealth taxes, nationalisation of utilities and ending the two\u2011child benefit cap. He also supports Lucy Powell, who was sacked as Commons leader by Starmer, in the deputy\u2011leadership contest. The battle to replace Angela Rayner pits Powell against Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, described as a proxy war between Starmer and Burnham. Burnham previously ran for Labour leadership in 2010 and 2015, losing to Ed Miliband and Jeremy Corbyn respectively. Wes Streeting, Health Secretary, is another favourite to replace Starmer. He won his Ilford North seat by a narrow 528\u2011vote majority and faces a threat from pro\u2011Palestinian independent candidates. Streeting\u2019s NHS backlog stands at 7.4\u202fmillion as of July\u202f2025, and he has promised to fix the damage caused by the previous Conservative government. Newly appointed Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood is priced at 12/1 by bookmakers; she is a socially conservative MP from Birmingham Ladywood and has taken a tough stance on migration. Yvette Cooper, Foreign Secretary, is also priced at 12/1; she was Home Secretary and has overseen the scrapping of the Rwanda plan. Darren Jones, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, is a potential successor, and Angela Rayner\u2019s resignation as Deputy PM and Housing Secretary has sparked a major reshuffle. Rayner, priced at 16/1, remains a prominent left\u2011wing figure despite a stamp\u2011duty scandal.

In a letter to Prime Minister Keir Starmer she wrote, 'Ich \u00fcbernehme die volle Verantwortung f\u00fcr diesen Fehler'. Starmer immediately reshuffled the cabinet: Foreign Secretary David Lammy was promoted to Justice Minister, Interior Minister Yvette Cooper replaced him, and Shabana Mahmood became the new Interior Minister. The reshuffle also saw the dismissal of House of Commons leader Lucy Powell and Scotland Secretary Ian Murray. Rayner is the eighth senior minister to leave Starmer\u2019s government, the most in the last 50 years. Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, used the resignation to call for early elections in 2027, claiming the cabinet is full of 'unqualified people' and that Starmer\u2019s government is 'genauso schlecht, wenn nicht sogar schlechter' than the previous Conservative administration.

As David Cameron said, 'The gamble by then Conservative Party Prime Minister, David Cameron, saw the quit camp win the day.'

Across diverse disciplinary perspectives (journalism, political risk, party system theory, leadership succession, elite theory, and Westminster studies), the consensus is anchored on several common factors: Johnson's reputational damage and toxicity within the party, his absence from Parliament, the lack of elite or grassroots movement for his return, and the strong Conservative Party preference for renewal and distancing from his legacy following major scandals. The party faces existential crisis, but all credible alternatives for leadership are current MPs, such as Robert Jenrick, rather than Johnson. Institutional, procedural, and cultural barriers to Johnson\u2019s return are seen as nearly insurmountable, especially with less than two months remaining before the resolution date. Experts acknowledge that only in a scenario of complete party meltdown and the simultaneous failure of all other alternatives\u2014a cascading, highly improbable crisis\u2014could a return occur, but even then, the movement and time required render this virtually impossible. In summary, Johnson's return is blocked by elite resistance, party image concerns, logistical impediments, and the absence of advocacy from either parliamentary or grassroots forces.",
