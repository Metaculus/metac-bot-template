There have been recent failed or foiled coup attempts (Nigeria October 2025, Mali August 2024), which can either signal instability or demonstrate regime vigilance and successful coup-proofing. Most vulnerable regimes have recently increased surveillance, purges, and foreign backing, which temporarily reduces coup risk. The short remaining window (about 6 weeks) is a major limiting factor.

In Nigeria, the recent coup attempt is neutralized, with the regime tightening security. In Latin America, political crises remain intense (Peru, Bolivia, Brazil), but militaries refrain from direct seizure of power, and incumbents either step down or suppress challenges using legal/institutional means. No successful (as per the question definition) military or self-coup occurs before Jan 1, 2026.",

Alternatively, a dramatic self-coup takes place in a country like Guinea-Bissau or in a fragile Latin American state, with the incumbent using the security forces to dissolve democratic institutions and retain power beyond legal means.",
            "final_reasoning": "The base rate of successful coups in Africa, especially in the Sahel, has sharply increased since 2020, with several cases in just the last two years. Elite fissures, state weakness, and external (especially Russian) involvement all heighten risks. However, recent successful juntas have responded to prior coup attempts by purging rivals and increasing security, which typically reduces the immediate risk of further coups in the short term. Multiple reports detail failed or preempted plots (e.g., Nigeria, Mali in 2024), showing both high intent and high regime vigilance. The time window\u2014just over six weeks\u2014further constrains the likelihood, as coups require significant planning and post-takeover consolidation. In Latin America, the base rate remains much lower, with recent attempts failing to fully oust sitting executives. While Guinea-Bissau and Benin show worrying trends in democratic backsliding, neither is currently showing the acute symptoms (military mobilization, mass unrest, or imminent executive overreach) typically preceding successful coups within such a short window. Therefore, while the risk is meaningfully elevated (especially in the Sahel), the combination of recent regime consolidation and the narrow time frame suggests the probability of a successful coup before January 1, 2026, is notably above the world average, but still less than even odds. I assess the probability at 28%.",

This period of 'coup-proofing' typically creates a short-term buffer during which coup risk drops sharply, even if underlying structural weaknesses persist.

No new indicators suggest imminent regime collapse or a breakdown large enough to outweigh these constraints. The small minority arguing for probabilities above 30% did not shift the consensus or provide new evidence compelling enough to warrant a substantial upward revision.

While my initial estimate at 28% was at the upper end of the consensus, it is now clear that a small downward adjustment is warranted to better reflect the short window, regime consolidation, and the historical rarity of successful coups in such a brief period.

These forces are part of the Russian 'Africa Corps,' subordinated to the Russian Ministry of Defense, with most soldiers having previously participated in the 'special military operation' in Ukraine. The presence includes military equipment such as aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles, along with Wagner Group flags. The Wagner Group, which was dissolved after the death of its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in a mysterious plane crash in August 2023, has been reorganized into a formal military unit. The group has been accused of severe human rights violations in Mali, including the abduction, detention, torture, and killing of hundreds of civilians between 2022 and 2024. A May 2025 investigation by the journalist network Forbidden Stories, based on testimonies from Malian refugees in Mauritania, documented six locations where Wagner operatives held civilians, including former UN bases. Torture methods included waterboarding, beatings, and cigarette burns, with victims reporting similarities to abuses in Ukraine. The Wagner Group has also provided military training, political advisory services, and security for leaders in Mali, where a military junta led by General Assimi Goita has ruled since 2020 and shifted allegiance from France to Russia.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Kreml-soll-Truppen-in-sechs-afrikanischen-Laendern-stationiert-haben-id30033579.html)\n\n**Benin Revises Constitution to Extend Terms and Create Senate Amid Political Controversy**\nThe National Assembly of Benin adopted a comprehensive constitutional revision early Saturday morning after a long night of deliberation. The new text establishes a Senate and extends presidential, parliamentary, and mayoral terms from five to seven years. According to La Nation, this reform will take effect starting with the next general elections, meaning it does not apply to President Patrice Talon\u2019s current term, which ends in May 2026. The presidential movement claims the revision aims to strengthen institutional stability, transparency, and democratic vitality. However, concerns persist: La Nouvelle Tribune notes that while the reform is framed as a move toward political calm and development, critics argue it may deepen political fractures and discourage opposition participation. The main opposition party, the D\u00e9mocrates, was excluded from local and presidential elections due to insufficient endorsements, raising suspicions about the process. Aujourd'hui reports that Talon, stepping down after his second term, is reshaping the political landscape in favor of his chosen successor, Romuald Wadagni, who now faces no significant challenger. The Pays, a Burkinab\u00e9 outlet, questions the timing of the reform, suggesting it is a politically calculated maneuver to entrench Talon\u2019s system, neutralize weakened opposition, and shield the elite from judicial accountability. The extension of mandates to seven years is seen as reducing political pluralism and diminishing electoral frequency, effectively locking in the current power structure. The creation of a Senate, where members are appointed or automatically included\u2014such as former presidents\u2014is viewed as a strategic move to ensure lifelong political privilege. Ledjely from Guinea highlights that the reform, despite initial optimism over Talon\u2019s pledge not to seek a third term, now appears to undermine democratic progress, especially given the exclusion of opposition figures and the continued detention of political prisoners like Reckya Madougou. The overall outcome suggests a democratic victory that may be more illusory than real.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 07:36 AM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/podcasts/revue-de-presse-afrique/20251117-%C3%A0-la-une-le-b%C3%A9nin-r%C3%A9vise-sa-constitution)\n\n**Teams Already Eliminated from the 2026 World Cup Qualifications**\nAs of November 15, 2025, numerous national teams have been officially eliminated from the qualification process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which began in September 2023 and will conclude in March 2026.

It claims that ECOWAS ordered the Niger junta to restore democratic rule, prompting a warning from other West African military regimes that any forceful intervention would be viewed as war and provoke retaliation. The article frames the situation as a potential continental conflict, suggesting Africa is heading toward internal warfare. It references Primate Elijah Ayodele, a self-proclaimed prophet, who in January 2023 and February 2023 foretold a 'mysterious attack' on Africa, describing it as an unexplainable crisis, widespread insecurity, and a war between African nations. Ayodele also warned that the presence of foreign powers\u2014such as China, Russia, the U.S., the UK, and Israel\u2014could turn Africa into a geopolitical testing ground. The article concludes by posing the question: 'Will it be right to say Africa is coming under a mysterious attack as foretold by Primate Ayodele?' The claims are presented without independent verification, relying solely on the prophet\u2019s statements and current geopolitical developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 02, 2023 09:18 AM\nSource:[topcelebrities.com.ng](https://topcelebrities.com.ng/is-africa-coming-under-mysterious-attacks-as-primate-ayodele-foretold/)\n\n**The Blogs: Mali: Al-Qaeda's Next Fallen State**\nAl-Qaeda has not been defeated but has repositioned itself from Afghanistan to Africa, with Mali on the brink of becoming the terror network's most significant resurgence in a generation. According to the article, after France's withdrawal in 2022 and the UN's departure in 2023, Al-Qaeda's local affiliate, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), systematically filled the power vacuum in Mali, dismantling state authority, enforcing sharia, taxing populations, and encircling the capital Bamako by 2025. This marks Mali as the third country in a generation to fall under Islamist rule, following Afghanistan under the Taliban and Syria under HTS. The article frames this not as a sudden collapse but as a methodical construction of a jihadist proto-state. Al-Qaeda has reconstituted a pan-African insurgent network across Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Mozambique, Libya, Algeria, Sudan, and Chad, creating a transcontinental ecosystem stronger than its Middle East presence. The U.S. drone campaign has constrained but not eliminated Al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni branch (AQAP), which could gain a sanctuary if Mali falls. A jihadist-controlled Mali would collapse Africa\u2019s security architecture, enable a contiguous jihadist corridor from Mauritania to Somalia, and destabilize North Africa, threatening Israel\u2019s intelligence and counterterrorism alliances. It would also empower Iran\u2019s proxies, trigger a new migration wave into Europe, and erase the West\u2019s strategic foothold in the Sahel. The article concludes that Mali\u2019s fall would mark the beginning of a new jihadist era, not in Kabul or Raqqa, but in Africa\u2019s overlooked expanses where Al-Qaeda has quietly prepared its most dangerous resurrection.

This expansion comes amid Western isolation following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, prompting Moscow to strengthen its political, economic, and military ties with African nations in recent years. A state TV correspondent reported on Sunday that Russian military officers and soldiers are operating in six African countries, though the specific nations were not named except for Mali. Reports indicate the deployment of additional Russian troops or military trainers in Burkina Faso, Niger, Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, and Libya. The African Corps, a unit linked to Russia's Ministry of Defense, has taken over the roles previously held by the Wagner Group, a private military company, across Africa, according to diplomatic sources in the Sahel region. The Wagner Group was dismantled and restructured after the mysterious plane crash that killed its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in August 2023, following a brief rebellion against Moscow. Wagner forces had previously fought in Ukraine and were deployed across Africa. The state TV report confirmed the African Corps is under Russia's Ministry of Defense and stated that most deployed personnel are 'veterans of the special military operation'\u2014Russia\u2019s term for the war in Ukraine. Footage from the report showed a flag resembling Wagner\u2019s skull emblem at a base in Mali, as well as Russian Su-25 aircraft conducting airstrikes and heavy Russian military equipment, including helicopters and armored personnel carriers. Moscow claims its forces are helping African governments combat extremist insurgencies.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 03:33 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5209797)\n\n**Azhar Observatory: Rise in Terrorist Activity in West Africa During October 2025, but with Decline in Civilian Casualties and Kidnappings**\nThe Azhar Observatory reported a rise in terrorist activities in West Africa during October 2025, with 4 attacks in Nigeria, 1 in Niger, and none in Senegal or Benin. Despite the increase in operations, civilian casualties dropped significantly from 141 in September to 74 in October\u2014a 52.5% decrease\u2014and kidnappings fell from 45 to 5, a reduction of nearly 89%. Injuries totaled 35 in October, compared to zero in September, indicating a shift from large-scale massacres to limited or targeted attacks. Nigeria remained the epicenter, with Boko Haram and ISWAP (Islamic State West Africa Province) continuing to operate, though with reduced casualties. Niger recorded only one attack with no fatalities, signaling improved border security following intensified joint operations with Nigeria and Chad. Senegal and Benin reported no terrorist activity, reflecting continued relative stability in the Gulf of Guinea region. The October data marked a strategic shift from September\u2019s pattern of killing 100 terrorists without arrests, toward more precise operations combining on-the-ground neutralization and intelligence-led arrests. The increase in military operations, neutralization rates, and arrests reflects improved security coordination among Sahel countries and Nigeria, particularly through the West African Sahel Group. The Azhar Observatory emphasized the need to strengthen early warning systems, border surveillance, intelligence sharing, regional cooperation, and rehabilitation programs to combat radicalization, especially in northern Nigeria and eastern Burkina Faso.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[cairo24.com](https://www.cairo24.com/2319396)\n\n**Benin Revises Constitution to Extend Terms and Create Senate Amid Political Controversy**\nThe National Assembly of Benin adopted a comprehensive constitutional revision early Saturday morning after a long night of deliberation.

The article highlights a regional crisis across Africa, citing fraudulent elections in Cameroon (where 92-year-old Paul Biya won 53.7% amid widespread allegations of fraud), Tanzania (where President Samia Suluhu Hassan claimed 98% of votes in a poll met with unprecedented protests and a crackdown), and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (where President Alassane Ouattara secured a fourth term with nearly 90% of the vote, despite a constitutional two-term limit). These outcomes have fueled public cynicism and weakened democratic norms. In Guinea-Bissau, President Umar Sissoco Embalo has undermined electoral legitimacy through repeated constitutional manipulations: he assumed office in February 2020 despite a pending legal challenge, dissolved parliament in May 2022 and again in December 2023, and delayed legislative elections until late 2024 due to alleged logistical issues. The supreme court, after its chief judge fled citing death threats, declined to rule on the 2020 dispute, leading to Ecowas recognition of Embalo\u2019s government. Embalo initially pledged not to seek re-election but reversed course in March 2025. A mediation team from Ecowas withdrew after threats of expulsion.

The event, hosted at the Alioune Blondin Beye Peacekeeping School, aimed to strengthen security and military cooperation in the Sahel region and promote new defense sector partnerships. Prominent Turkish companies including Baykar, Aselsan, Roketsan, and Otokar participated, showcasing advanced technologies such as drones and radar systems, underscoring Ankara\u2019s growing defense influence in Africa through agreements with Mali and other Sahel Alliance (AES) members. The exhibition also attracted participation from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Russia, which reaffirmed its support for Mali in counterterrorism efforts. Social media and activists highlighted the event as a 'slap' to Algerian and French media narratives predicting Bamako\u2019s collapse, emphasizing that the successful organization of the exhibition proves the capital\u2019s stability and strategic attractiveness for military investment. The 'Ak\u0131nc\u0131' drone displayed at the exhibition was noted as part of the Turkish-Malian defense agreement and had recently been shot down during operations. BAMEX 2025 is seen as a unique platform for enhancing African security sovereignty and fostering regional cooperation amid growing competition between Turkey, Russia, and China in the African arms market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 08:50 PM\nSource:[fesnews.media](https://fesnews.media/313294/2025/11/12/)\n\n**Amid West Africa\u2019s Coups, Faith Leaders Emerge As Pillars Of Stability**\nOver the past decade, more than a dozen military coups have destabilized West Africa and the Sahel, including in Mali (2020), Guinea (2021), Burkina Faso (2022), Niger (2023), and Gabon (2023), with attempted coups in Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau. Amid this political chaos, religious leaders\u2014such as Cardinal Philippe Ou\u00e9draogo of Burkina Faso, Imam Mahmoud Dicko of Mali, and Islamic leaders in Niger\u2014have emerged as key stabilizing figures. They have consistently advocated for dialogue, restraint, and national unity, using their moral authority to de-escalate tensions and prevent violence. In Burkina Faso, Ou\u00e9draogo urged a national conversation after two coups in 2022, while in Mali, Dicko played a dual role as both a protest voice and a mediator during the 2020 uprising. In Niger, Islamic leaders framed resistance to foreign military intervention as a moral defense of sovereignty. In Guinea and Gabon, clergy called for accountability and peace after military takeovers. Though not universally trusted\u2014some are criticized for silence or proximity to power\u2014their influence persists where formal institutions have failed. Their sermons and homilies often carry more public resonance than government statements. Despite challenges, including ongoing jihadist violence displacing millions in Burkina Faso and Mali, faith leaders remain among the last civic anchors in fragile states. Their role may diminish if military regimes consolidate power, but in transitional moments, they could still shape the region\u2019s future governance.

Over forty military personnel, including a brigadier general, a colonel, and several majors, were detained by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) following raids in late October 2025, with the Abuja residence of former Bayelsa State Governor Timipre Sylva raided on October 29, 2025. His brother was arrested during the operation. Sylva, reportedly abroad for a medical check-up in the UK and a conference in Malaysia, is alleged to have fled Nigeria via the creeks to Senegal and then to Argentina, where he is said to have business interests. Investigators reportedly traced \u20a646 billion to an account linked to him, funds suspected of financing the coup plot\u2014though these claims remain unconfirmed by the government. While the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) described the operation as a 'routine internal disciplinary investigation,' credible reports from Premium Times and PRNigeria indicate a broader conspiracy involving mid- to senior-level officers planning to neutralize key political figures, including the vice president, Senate president, and speaker of the House of Representatives. This incident follows a regional trend of military coups in West Africa, including in Mali (2020, 2021), Guinea (2021), Burkina Faso (2022), Niger (2023), and Gabon (2023). Nigeria\u2019s history includes multiple coups since independence in 1960, such as the 1966 counter-coup, the 1983 coup that ousted Shehu Shagari, and the 1985 coup that brought Ibrahim Babangida to power. The article argues that the alleged coup reflects deeper institutional issues: low military morale, inadequate welfare, political interference, and growing distrust. It warns that the real threat to democracy lies not in overt military force but in systemic neglect and public despair. The author urges President Tinubu to treat the incident not merely as a criminal matter but as a warning to rebuild trust, improve transparency, and restore military morale\u2014essential acts for national preservation. The piece concludes that democracy must be actively sustained through justice, inclusion, and accountability, especially as West Africa faces democratic decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 07:15 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@johnogunpitan17/nigerias-2025-coup-scare-everything-you-need-to-know-by-anjolaoluwa-ogunpitan-3cdcba69c2ba)\n\n**The Jihadist Conundrum in the Sahel**\nThe article analyzes the escalating jihadist insurgency in the Sahel region, particularly in Mali, following the French withdrawal in July 2022 after the Malian military coup led by President Assimi Goita. Since then, Russian Wagner Group and the Africa Corps have replaced French forces, but their military support\u2014though including hardware, training, and access to mineral resources like gold, lithium, and uranium\u2014has failed to contain the rise of Islamist insurgents, particularly Jama'at Nasrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an Al-Qaeda-linked group. Insurgent attacks surged from 1,900 in 2019 to over 5,500 in 2024, with 3,800 attacks recorded by October 10, 2025, resulting in 76,900 deaths since 2019, 56% of which occurred in Mali and Burkina Faso. The Malian junta\u2019s propaganda of military success has been exposed as a facade, with major attacks on military outposts and increasing control loss in rural areas. The junta\u2019s human rights violations and reliance on foreign military contractors have undermined legitimacy. A new tactic by JNIM in August 2025\u2014targeting fuel imports from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Mauritania, and Guinea\u2014has caused a severe fuel crisis in Bamako, closing schools and universities. Foreign companies, including seven Chinese and three Indian nationals, were kidnapped in July 2025, highlighting the fragility of the economy. The U.S. Embassy has issued an 'immediate departure' advisory due to deteriorating security. The article warns that without urgent counter-insurgency reforms\u2014including professional chain-of-command, village protection, local cooperation, internal purges of corrupt officers, and regional coordination with ECOWAS\u2014the fall of Bamako is imminent. The risk of a state collapse similar to ISIS in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan looms, threatening regional stability across Burkina Faso and Niger. The author concludes that sustainable solutions require national coordination within the Malian military, with foreign support limited to training, intelligence, and airpower, not boots on the ground.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@ahsankenway/the-jihadist-conundrum-in-the-sahel-1d5c5b2b3b17)\n\n**Overthrowing government: Full list of African countries that fell to military rule after coup plot**\nSince August 2020, seven African countries have experienced military takeovers following coup plots, disrupting civilian governments. On 26 July 2023, Niger's military removed President Mohamed Bazoum, installing General Abdourahamane Tiani as leader; ECOWAS responded with plans to deploy a regional force to restore constitutional order, while the junta proposed a maximum three-year transition. Burkina Faso saw two coups in less than a year: President Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9 was ousted on 24 January 2022, replaced by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who was himself overthrown on 30 September by Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, who now leads a transitional government with elections scheduled for July 2024. Sudan\u2019s democratic transition collapsed on 25 October 2021 when General Abdel Fattah al-Burhane removed civilian leaders; since 15 April 2023, a deadly conflict between Burhane and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdane Daglo has caused at least 5,000 deaths. Guinea\u2019s President Alpha Cond\u00e9 was overthrown on 5 September 2021, with Colonel Mamady Doumbouya assuming power on 1 October, pledging to return to civilian rule by the end of 2024. Mali\u2019s President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta was ousted on 18 August 2020, leading to a transitional government; on 24 May 2021, the military arrested both the president and prime minister, and Colonel Assimi Go\u00efta became transitional president in June, with elections planned for February 2024. Madagascar was listed among affected countries, but details of a successful military takeover remain unclear. Nigeria, though not listed as having a recent coup, has a history of military rule since independence in 1960; researchers note that the military\u2019s economic policies in the 1980s led to 45% of foreign-exchange earnings being used for debt servicing, resulting in minimal growth, widespread poverty, and long-term instability.

According to the joint statement released by the three military\u2011governed states, the ICC has proven \"incapable of investigating and prosecuting proven war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression\".  The leaders of the three countries, which have close ties to Russia, also said they intend to establish \"local mechanisms for strengthening peace and justice\".  They criticised the ICC for the fact that, out of the 33 cases opened since its founding, all but one involved African states.  The withdrawal will take effect one year after the countries submit a notice to the UN Secretary\u2011General.  The three West African states, which came to power through coups between 2020 and 2023, joined forces in 2023 to form the Sahel Alliance, later renamed the Confederation of Sahel Countries, and cooperate with the Russian Federation.  Their armies have been accused of committing war crimes against civilians during operations against jihadist groups linked to Al\u2011Qaeda and the Islamic State.  In March 2023 the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on charges of war crimes, including the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children and the forced relocation of Ukrainians to Russia.

Only Niger, represented by Colonel Soumana Kalkoye, the defence attach\u00e9 at the Nigerien embassy in Abuja, attended the summit. The conference, which ran until 27\u202fAugust, brought senior officers from most African states to 'discuter de strat\u00e9gies collectives' and to 'trouver des solutions locales aux besoins de l'Afrique en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9fense', according to the summit programme.

Since the coups in 2020\u20132021, the armed forces have failed to improve the fragile security situation; instead, Islamist insurgents and other rebels have taken control of more territory.  Within the armies, disagreements over strategy and the transition to a democratic government have surfaced, according to political analyst Beverly\u202fOchieng of Control\u202fRisks.  In Mali, a failed coup in August 2024 led to the arrest of dozens of soldiers, including two prominent generals and a French officer accused of mobilising civilians for the French intelligence service; the French foreign ministry dismissed the allegations as \"completely unfounded\".  Ochieng notes that the coup attempt shows the regime\u2019s attempt to pre\u2011empt internal dissent.  Since the 2021 coup, Mali\u2019s junta has ended the UN mission, expelled France and brought in Russian paramilitaries, while repeatedly facing accusations of serious human\u2011rights violations from the UN and NGOs.  In August 2024, a protest in the village of Diafarab\u00e9 over alleged mass killings by the army prompted the dismissal of the local governor, who was later arrested on charges of \"destabilising the state\".  Economic hardship, new taxes and the dissolution of political parties have sparked further protests, which were violently suppressed.  The three countries left ECOWAS in 2023 and formed the Sahel Alliance (AES), which lacks access to a port and relies on neighbouring coastal states, contributing to rising prices and frequent power outages.  In Burkina\u202fFaso, the young president Ibrahim\u202fTraor\u00e9 faces criticism within the army because of his low rank and the potential expansion of Islamist influence; in Niger, mutinies have been reported after military defeats against Islamist militias.

    "summary": "The panel of forecasting experts broadly agrees that the risk of a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026, is non-negligible but remains below a 50% threshold, primarily due to the short time window (~6 weeks) and recent developments in both regions. Most experts converge on a probability range between 12% and 34%, with the modal estimate clustering at 18%.\n\nKey shared factors increasing the probability include:\n- The recent high base rate of coups in Africa, especially in the Sahel (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger), where regime fragility, elite fragmentation, and jihadist insurgencies persist.\n- Ongoing elite discontent and multiple recent, though unsuccessful or foiled, coup attempts (notably in Nigeria and Mali), which suggest ongoing instability beneath the surface.\n- External actors, such as Russia's Africa Corps, which simultaneously bolster current juntas but can create new elite rivalries or resentment.\n- Evidence of eroding regime legitimacy, manipulated elections, and economic crises as further risk factors, particularly in West Africa and Guinea-Bissau.\n\nFactors decreasing probability are:\n- Consolidation and coup-proofing by current military juntas in the Sahel, who have instituted purges, heightened surveillance, and received external (notably Russian and Turkish) military support, making new coups harder in the immediate term.\n- A very short forecast window, which statistically reduces the odds, as coups are rare and require time to coordinate and execute.\n- In Latin America, a much lower base rate for successful coups post-1990s, with civil-military norms, institutional buffers, and recent attempted coups in Bolivia, Peru, and Brazil all failing to unseat incumbents.\n\nScenarios for a 'yes' outcome focus on internal splits within Sahelian military regimes, opportunistic moves by dissatisfied factions amid security or economic crises, or a surprise self-coup in a fragile democracy (like Guinea-Bissau or Benin). The 'no' scenario is more likely, involving ongoing repression, purges, and foreign support deterring or preventing successful coup plotting, combined with relative stability in Latin America.\n\nFinal probabilities across experts are as follows: 12%, 13%, 18% (multiple experts), 20%, 26%, 28% (multiple experts), 33%, and 34%. The consensus centers around 18\u201320% (\u201cmoderate, non-trivial, but still less likely than not\u201d), with slightly higher estimates given by those emphasizing ongoing elite fragmentation and state fragility in the Sahel, and lower estimates by those focusing on recent consolidation and the short time window.",
