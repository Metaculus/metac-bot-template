Deaths linked to resistant infections increased from 2,041 in 2023 to 2,379 in 2024, a rise of 338. Of the resistant bloodstream infections over the past six years, 65% were caused by E. coli, a common source of urinary tract infections. The English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR) report highlights that antibiotic use in NHS primary care fell from 14.21 to 13.96 defined daily doses (DID) per 1,000 people between 2019 and 2024, but private dispensing in community pharmacies more than doubled, from 1.95 to 3.93 DID, leading to a 10.7% overall increase in primary care antibiotic use. In 2024, 22% of antibiotics were dispensed privately. Adults over 45 accounted for 90% of cases, with 46.2% of infections in those over 74. The most deprived communities faced a 47.2% higher rate of resistant bacteraemia than the least deprived, up from a 29% gap in 2019. UKHSA and government officials, including Health Minister Zubir Ahmed and Professor Susan Hopkins, emphasize that antibiotic resistance is a major health threat, urging responsible use, vaccination, and proper disposal of unused antibiotics. They stress the need for innovation, including new antibiotics, diagnostics, and treatments like bacteriophage therapy, while collaborating globally to track and respond to emerging threats. NHS antibiotic use overall was 2% lower than the 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, though prescribing remains above pre-pandemic levels in children and young people.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[Pharmabiz](https://pharmabiz.com/ArticleDetails.aspx?aid=182426&sid=2)\n\n**Public Health Reports 80% Drop in Dengue Cases and Highlights Antimicrobial Resistance as Major Threat**\nThe Dominican Republic's Ministry of Public Health reported an 80% reduction in dengue cases and zero deaths from the disease during 2025, according to the Epidemiological Bulletin for week 44. A total of 258 dengue cases were confirmed in 2025, compared to 1,291 cases in 2024. The report also highlights a decline in maternal and infant mortality: 4 maternal deaths were reported in week 44 (144 cumulative, a 6% decrease from 2024), and 33 infant deaths (1,542 cumulative, a 20% decrease from the same period in 2024). Malaria cases totaled 810 (4 new cases in week 44), with an incidence rate of 8.91 per 100,000 and zero lethality. No cases of leptospirosis were reported this week, with 115 confirmed cases this year. Cholera remains at zero cases, indicating effective preventive and response measures. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continues to circulate, primarily affecting children, though signs of slowing transmission are evident. The bulletin\u2019s central focus is antimicrobial resistance (AMR), described as a major global public health threat. The Ministry explains that AMR arises when microorganisms develop mechanisms to evade antimicrobial drugs, leading to untreatable infections. This compromises the effectiveness of essential medicines, including antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics, and threatens medical procedures. The Ministry attributes AMR to excessive and inappropriate antimicrobial use, poor sanitation, and inadequate infection control. It emphasizes the need for strengthened surveillance, regulation of over-the-counter drug sales, and public awareness campaigns. In the Dominican Republic, the Ministry is implementing its National 'One Health' Strategy in coordination with the Ministries of Agriculture and Environment, including enhanced detection, resistance control, and public and professional education. The Ministry also operates an integrated response network for AMR detection and a public communication campaign targeting the general population, healthcare providers, and agricultural workers.

Deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections increased from 2,041 in 2023 to 2,379 in 2024, an increase of 338 deaths. Bloodstream infections (bacteraemia) caused by antibiotic resistance rose by 9.3%, from 18,740 cases in 2023 to 20,484 in 2024. The English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR) report indicates that 65% of antibiotic-resistant bloodstream infections over the past six years were caused by E. coli. Adults over 45 account for 90% of cases, with 46.2% occurring in those over 74. A widening socioeconomic gap is evident: people in the most deprived areas had a 47.2% higher rate of resistant bacteraemia than those in the least deprived areas\u2014up from a 29% difference in 2019. Antibiotic prescribing in primary care (79.6%) and dentistry remains below 2019 levels, and overall NHS antibiotic use in 2024 was 2% lower than the 2019 baseline.

The number of cases of bacteraemia caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria also increased by 9.3%, from 18,740 to 20,484. The UKHSA attributes part of the rise to the Pharmacy First scheme, a government policy under Rishi Sunak that allows patients to obtain antibiotics without a GP consultation, leading to a 22% share of antibiotics being dispensed through the private sector in 2024. While the scheme aims to reduce GP workload, concerns are growing that it may contribute to inappropriate antibiotic use and accelerate antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a major global health threat predicted to cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The report emphasizes that the rise in AMR-related deaths is worsening and calls for urgent, intensified policy action to address the growing public health crisis. The UKHSA stresses that the increase in antibiotic supply through Pharmacy First should be monitored carefully in light of broader shifts in patient care access.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 11:06 AM\nSource:[The News International](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1357651-deaths-from-superbug-infections-increase-17-in-england-in-2024-report-says)\n\n**Antibiotic resistant infection deaths increasing in England, despite lower NHS antibiotic use**\nAntibiotic-resistant infections in England are increasing, with nearly 400 new cases reported weekly in 2024, according to a report by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

The WHO's 'End TB Strategy,' launched in 2014 and 2015, set goals for 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2035 to significantly reduce TB incidence, deaths, and patient costs. In 2024, an estimated 10.7 million people worldwide were infected with TB\u20145.8 million men, 3.7 million women, and 1.2 million children. In 2023, TB caused 1.25 million deaths, including 161,000 among people living with HIV. Although TB deaths declined by 3% and incidence by 2% compared to 2023, gains remain fragile. The WHO\u2019s Teresa Kassaye stated that for the first time since the pandemic disrupted health services, TB cases and deaths have declined. However, she warned that reduced international aid funding in low- and middle-income countries could reverse hard-won progress. Global funding for TB prevention, diagnosis, and treatment reached only $5.9 billion in 2024, far below the estimated $22 billion needed annually through 2027. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a major public health crisis, with only two out of every five MDR-TB patients receiving treatment in 2023. TB is a curable and preventable disease caused by bacteria primarily affecting the lungs and transmitted through airborne droplets when infected individuals cough, sneeze, or spit. The disease persists globally across all age groups and remains the world\u2019s deadliest infectious disease, having briefly surpassed COVID-19 as the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent before being overtaken again.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 12:53 AM\nSource:[alarab.co.uk](https://www.alarab.co.uk/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%82%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9)\n\n**Antibiotic-resistant infections are on the rise, UKSHA warns**\nThe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported a significant rise in antibiotic-resistant infections in 2024, with an average of nearly 400 new cases per week. Deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections increased from 2,041 in 2023 to 2,379 in 2024, an increase of 338 deaths. Bloodstream infections (bacteraemia) caused by antibiotic resistance rose by 9.3%, from 18,740 cases in 2023 to 20,484 in 2024. The English Surveillance Programme for Antimicrobial Utilisation and Resistance (ESPAUR) report indicates that 65% of antibiotic-resistant bloodstream infections over the past six years were caused by E. coli. Adults over 45 account for 90% of cases, with 46.2% occurring in those over 74. A widening socioeconomic gap is evident: people in the most deprived areas had a 47.2% higher rate of resistant bacteraemia than those in the least deprived areas\u2014up from a 29% difference in 2019. Antibiotic prescribing in primary care (79.6%) and dentistry remains below 2019 levels, and overall NHS antibiotic use in 2024 was 2% lower than the 2019 baseline. However, prescribing in children and young people remains above pre-pandemic levels. Private pharmacy dispensing more than doubled from 1.95 to 3.93 Defined Daily Doses (DID) per 1,000 people, contributing to a 10.7% overall increase in primary care antibiotic use between 2019 and 2024. Professor Susan Hopkins of UKHSA emphasized the need for responsible antibiotic use, new treatments, and infection prevention. Health Minister Zubir Ahmed reiterated that collective action\u2014responsible antibiotic use, vaccinations, and following clinical advice\u2014is essential to preserve antibiotics for future generations.\nOriginal language: en-GB\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[Innovation News Network](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/antibiotic-resistant-infections-are-on-the-rise-uksha-warns/63730/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=antibiotic-resistant-infections-are-on-the-rise-uksha-warns)\n\n**Antibiotic-Resistant Bacterial Infections to Rise in Europe Amid Aging Population, Study Warns**\nA study published in PLOS Medicine on November 13, 2025, projects a significant rise in bacterial infections resistant to antibiotics across Europe in the coming decades, primarily driven by population aging. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine analyzed over 12 million routine blood tests from 29 European countries between 2010 and 2019 to assess bacterial susceptibility. Using demographic projections, they developed models predicting the evolution of resistant infections through 2050. Results indicate rising rates of bloodstream infections, with the most pronounced increases among men and individuals over 74 years old, while trends may stabilize or decline in younger age groups. The authors stress that models ignoring age and sex could substantially underestimate future antimicrobial resistance burdens. Even under optimistic scenarios with strong public health interventions, only two-thirds of studied bacterial-antibiotic combinations are projected to achieve a 10% reduction in resistant infections by 2030\u2014a target set by the United Nations. The burden will not be uniform, varying by country, age group, and sex, with the highest increases expected in those over 65.

The research, led by Gwenan Knight of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, highlights that infection rates will increase most sharply among individuals over 74 years old and in men, with the steepest rises observed in six of eight bacterial-antibiotic combinations studied. The study emphasizes that age and sex are rarely considered in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) projections, yet they significantly influence who is most at risk. Even with strong public health interventions, achieving a 10% reduction in resistant infections by 2030\u2014aligned with UN targets\u2014would be feasible for only about two-thirds of the bacterial-antibiotic combinations analyzed. The authors stress that integrating demographic trends with infection data is crucial for designing targeted interventions to reduce mortality and morbidity.

The number of cases of bacteraemia caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria also increased by 9.3%, from 18,740 to 20,484. The UKHSA attributes part of the rise to the Pharmacy First scheme, a government policy under Rishi Sunak that allows patients to obtain antibiotics without a GP consultation, leading to a 22% share of antibiotics being dispensed through the private sector in 2024. While the scheme aims to reduce GP workload, concerns are growing that it may contribute to inappropriate antibiotic use and accelerate antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a major global health threat predicted to cause up to 10 million deaths annually by 2050. The report emphasizes that the rise in AMR-related deaths is worsening and calls for urgent, intensified policy action to address the growing public health crisis. The UKHSA stresses that the increase in antibiotic supply through Pharmacy First should be monitored carefully in light of broader shifts in patient care access.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 11:06 AM\nSource:[The News International](https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1357651-deaths-from-superbug-infections-increase-17-in-england-in-2024-report-says)\n\n**Antibiotic resistant infection deaths increasing in England, despite lower NHS antibiotic use**\nAntibiotic-resistant infections in England are increasing, with nearly 400 new cases reported weekly in 2024, according to a report by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

The report, based on data from over 100 countries submitted to the Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS), presents, for the first time, prevalence estimates for resistance to 22 antibiotics used to treat urinary, gastrointestinal, bloodstream, and gonorrhea infections. It covers eight common bacterial pathogens: Acinetobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella spp. non-typhoidal, Shigella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resistance is highest in the South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, where one in three reported infections is resistant, and in Africa, where one in five is resistant. The WHO warns that resistance is growing faster than medical advances, posing a global health threat. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, emphasized the need for responsible antibiotic use, access to quality diagnostics and vaccines, and investment in new-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular testing. Gram-negative bacteria, particularly E. coli and K. pneumoniae, are highlighted as the greatest threat, especially in low-resource settings.

According to a new WHO report, 1 in 6 infections globally in 2023 were resistant to common antibiotics, including those used for urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and E. coli. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) causes over 1 million deaths annually and contributes to nearly 5 million additional deaths. Dr. Yvan Hutin, WHO\u2019s Director of the Department of Antimicrobial Resistance, stated that 'antibiotic resistance is widespread and threatening the future of modern medicine,' noting that limited access to quality healthcare increases the risk of drug-resistant infections. The issue is most severe in Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, where 1 in 3 infections are resistant\u2014roughly double the global average and more than three times higher than in Europe or the Western Pacific. Resistance is also higher in low- and middle-income countries due to weaker health systems. The report highlights rising resistance in gram-negative bacteria like E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which are difficult to treat due to their protective outer layer. In parts of Africa, cephalosporin resistance exceeds 70%, often eliminating first-line treatment options. Without intervention, AMR could reduce global economic output by $1.7 trillion by 2050 and lead to 39 million deaths over the next 25 years, according to a Lancet study. However, there is progress: since WHO launched its AMR surveillance system in 2015, nearly 140 countries have joined, with 100 contributing data to the latest report\u2014a fourfold increase from previous years.

Yvan Hutin, head of the WHO\u2019s antimicrobial resistance (AMR) department, described the findings as 'deeply concerning,' emphasizing that the growing resistance threatens lives due to a lack of effective treatment options. The report analyzed data from over 23 million infections across 104 countries, revealing that resistance to 22 monitored antibiotics increased by over 40% between 2018 and 2023, with an annual average rise of 5% to 15%. Key pathogens like E. coli and K. pneumoniae show high resistance rates\u2014over 40% of E. coli and 55% of K. pneumoniae infections are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, a first-line treatment. Resistance to second-line antibiotics is also rising, contributing to projected deaths increasing by 70% by 2050. The highest resistance rates were observed in Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean, where one in three infections were resistant, compared to one in five in Africa. Silvia Bertagnolio, WHO\u2019s AMR surveillance unit head, noted that weaker health systems and limited diagnostic and treatment capacity contribute to higher resistance. Additionally, 48% of countries still report no data on AMR, leaving global monitoring incomplete. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that progress is being made 'blindly' in many regions. The UN health agency previously cautioned that insufficient new diagnostics and treatments are in development, creating a 'serious future threat' as rising antibiotic use, resistance, and lack of new therapies form a 'very dangerous combination,' according to Hutin.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[CNEWS](https://www.cnews.fr/sante/2025-10-13/resistance-aux-antibiotiques-les-deces-pourraient-bondir-de-70-dici-2050-alerte)\n\n**WHO Warns of Global Rise in Antibiotic Resistance**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global warning on October 13, 2025, about the widespread and escalating resistance to antibiotics.

Data from the WHO\u2019s Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) across over 100 countries indicate that resistance to essential antibiotics is a growing threat to global health. The new global report provides, for the first time, estimates of resistance to 22 antibiotics used to treat urinary, gastrointestinal, bloodstream, and gonorrhea infections. Eight common bacteria are involved, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which are increasingly resistant to third-generation cephalosporins\u2014used as first-line treatments\u2014with resistance rates exceeding 40% and 55%, respectively, and over 70% in Africa. These bacteria can cause sepsis, organ failure, and death. Resistance to carbapenems, once rare, is also rising. The consequences include reliance on expensive, less accessible, and often unavailable last-resort antibiotics in low-income countries. WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized that antimicrobial resistance is outpacing medical progress and threatens global health. He urged responsible antibiotic use, access to quality diagnostics and vaccines, and investment in new antibiotics and rapid molecular tests. The WHO also called on countries to strengthen laboratory systems to generate reliable surveillance data, as many nations currently lack the capacity to monitor resistance effectively.

    "summary": "All experts forecast a very low probability that annual US deaths from antibiotic-resistant infections will double to at least 70,000 (from the most recent CDC estimate of ~37,000) by December 31, 2025. Their reasoning is rooted in base rates\u2014over the past decade, deaths have risen only gradually (from 23,000 to 37,000), with no precedent for such a sudden surge. No major US outbreak, abrupt reporting change, or policy shift is evident or expected before the end of 2025. While global, UK, and European data show significant percentage increases in AMR-related deaths and WHO warns of worsening trends, these numbers do not translate to the rapid US doubling required.
