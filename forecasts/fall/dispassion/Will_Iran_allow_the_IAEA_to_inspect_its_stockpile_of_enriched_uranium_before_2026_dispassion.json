The repeated pattern in 2025 of Iran agreeing to, then voiding, inspection deals in response to hostile actions or sanctions, fits the RSCT prediction of a security dilemma spiral.

The constructivist analysis underestimates how regime security and political cost calculations (often highlighted by realism and regime-type theories) override even identity-based incentives in a short time window. Furthermore, the technical excuse of uranium being 'under rubble' allows Iran to maintain NPT rhetorical compliance without substantive transparency, making a symbolic gesture less likely to materialize as a formal, announced agreement.

The forecast rightly recognizes that transparency is viewed as a liability in Tehran\u2019s current threat environment, and that any agreement would require either a dramatic shift in threat perception or a compelling incentive, neither of which is visible. By situating Iran\u2019s behavior within the classic security dilemma spiral, the forecaster gives due weight to entrenched mistrust and the feedback loop of mutual suspicion, which is often overlooked by more institutionally or normatively oriented analyses.

The Realist forecaster also properly notes that only overwhelming pressure or existential threat would prompt a tactical reversal, which aligns with the observed pattern in high-stakes nuclear negotiations. Furthermore, the forecast\u2019s recognition of the short time frame and entrenched status quo reflects a disciplined weighting of inertia and path dependence, both crucial in diplomatic forecasting.

Additionally, the RSCT account could give more weight to the possibility that Iran, facing the risk of a new round of strikes or a dramatic diplomatic move by a major power, might make a tactical and symbolic inspection concession. While the base rate remains low and the forecasted probability is reasonable, the analysis would be strengthened by a clearer integration of global power dynamics alongside regional ones, as these may be decisive in the narrow window before 2026."

While Track Two efforts do, in rare cases, produce late-stage deals, the Iranian state\u2019s current narrative\u2014rooted in resistance, victimhood, and distrust after perceived Western betrayal\u2014means that any such deal must overcome more than just practical or diplomatic hurdles; it must reconcile with dominant narratives that frame inspections as capitulation and humiliation. The forecast underplays how these constructed meanings can harden positions and raise the political cost of compromise, even for face-saving gestures.

The forecast is particularly strong in distinguishing between the existence of diplomatic incentives (which are necessary but not sufficient) and the lack of observable momentum toward an actual agreement. The low probability assigned is therefore justified by the historical record\u2014wherein states rarely restore intrusive access in the wake of military attacks and sanctions without significant, protracted negotiation. This approach also avoids wishful thinking about 'symbolic' or partial deals, recognizing that even minimal inspection agreements require political groundwork that is currently absent.

Their assessment that technical obstacles provide plausible deniability for delay is consistent with how states under acute threat use ambiguity to maintain leverage and avoid escalation. Moreover, the recognition that only a dramatic shift\u2014such as a credible threat of force or a backchannel breakthrough\u2014would alter the current trajectory aligns with both negotiation theory and empirical base rates in nuclear crises.

The domestic political context is highly charged, with hardline actors dominating and recent parliamentary actions reinforcing defiance as a matter of both national pride and regime survival. Moreover, the technical excuse that uranium is 'under rubble' allows Iran to publicly maintain its NPT posture without conceding substantive transparency or inspection. While a last-minute, symbolic deal cannot be completely excluded, the magnitude of regime security concerns and the lack of visible diplomatic momentum make a probability in the 10-15% range far more consistent with historical precedent and the current signals.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi confirmed that movement near uranium enrichment sites was observed in October 2024, but emphasized this does not indicate active enrichment. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei stated that Grossi is 'fully aware' of the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program and should refrain from 'unfounded opinions.' Iranian officials previously accused the IAEA of justifying Israel\u2019s attacks, which began the day after the IAEA Board of Governors declared Iran in violation of its non-proliferation obligations. Grossi told FT that while the IAEA seeks to understand Iran\u2019s 'difficult' circumstances, Iran must still comply with its safeguards obligations. He warned that if Iran is treated as exempt due to war, the IAEA would lose all visual access to materials. Grossi also highlighted the unresolved fate of 408 kilograms of uranium enriched nearly to weapons-grade levels. The FT notes experts fear Israel may launch further attacks if concerns over high-enriched uranium stocks are not addressed and if no progress is made on a nuclear deal between Washington and Tehran.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 05:31 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418 Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/politics/68597023/)\n\n**Grossi Urges Iran to Avoid 'Confrontation' with the West Over Nuclear Program**\nRafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned Iran that its membership in the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is conditional upon fulfilling its commitments, urging improved cooperation with IAEA inspectors to avoid confrontation with the West. In an interview with the Financial Times, Grossi revealed that the IAEA conducted approximately 12 inspections since the outbreak of the Iran-Israel war in June 2024 but was denied access to key nuclear sites, including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan\u2014sites previously targeted in U.S. airstrikes. He emphasized that the attacks caused significant damage and that the fate of 408 kilograms of uranium enriched close to weapons-grade remains unclear, heightening the urgency for resumed inspections. Grossi stated, 'Iran cannot claim membership in the NPT while failing to meet its obligations,' and stressed that the IAEA seeks to manage its 'volatile' relationship with Tehran through understanding and restraint, but cannot accept war as a justification for evading responsibilities. In response, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Baghaei asserted that the IAEA 'understands the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program' and urged it to avoid 'statements not grounded in reality.' Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi claimed Iran\u2019s enriched uranium stockpile is 'buried under rubble' and reiterated Iran\u2019s refusal to negotiate with the U.S. on 'zero enrichment' or its missile program, though it remains open to fair nuclear talks based on 'mutual benefit.' Following the 12-day conflict, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA, prompting analysts and diplomats to warn that continued uncertainty over the enriched uranium could lead Israel to launch new strikes, especially amid stalled U.S.-Iran negotiations. Observers stress that resolving the crisis requires full access for international inspectors, clarification on the fate of the enriched uranium, and genuine political will to restart dialogue. China\u2019s Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a phone call with Araghchi, urged resumption of nuclear talks, commended Iran\u2019s reaffirmation of the peaceful nature of its program, and affirmed support for its right to peaceful nuclear energy, calling for all parties to maintain communication channels. This follows the UN\u2019s reinstatement of nuclear-related sanctions in September 2024 after the UK, France, and Germany activated the 'snapback mechanism' over alleged violations of the 2015 nuclear deal. The June 2024 attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities by the U.S. and Israel have severely strained relations between Tehran and the IAEA.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 04:39 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5205452)\n\n**Grossi Warns: Iran Still Holds All Enriched Uranium After Recent Nuclear Strikes**\nRafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned on Wednesday, November 5, 2025, that tensions between Iran and Western countries persist due to Iran's lack of cooperation in inspections of its nuclear facilities. According to Grossi, Iran has not allowed IAEA inspectors access to its most critical sites since the recent Israeli and American strikes. He stated that Iran still retains nearly its entire stockpile of enriched uranium, despite damage to nuclear facilities during the brief conflict with Israel in June 2025. The targeted facilities include Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Grossi emphasized that the fate of approximately 408 kilograms of uranium close to weapons-grade use remains unknown, heightening the urgency for resumed inspections. The IAEA has conducted around 12 inspection visits since the attacks but has been denied access to key sites. Grossi noted that relations with Tehran are managed through efforts to reach understanding, but require greater Iranian commitment to transparency. This information was reported by 'Al-Bawaba' news portal.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0627\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645](https://m.akhbarelyom.com/news/NewDetails/4719682/1/%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AD%D8%B0%D8%B1-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B8-%D8%A8%D9%83%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B1)\n\n**IAEA Urges Iran for Substantial Improvement in Cooperation with Inspectors**\nRafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), urged Iran to make a 'substantial improvement' in its cooperation with UN international inspectors, warning that escalating tensions with the West could have serious consequences. Despite nearly 12 inspections conducted by the IAEA in Iran since the conflict with Israel in June 2024, access has been denied to key nuclear sites including Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan\u2014locations previously targeted by U.S. strikes. Grossi emphasized that the fate of 408 kilograms of uranium enriched to levels near weapons-grade remains unclear, creating an 'increasing sense of urgency' to resume inspections, stating, 'We really need to restart inspection activities.' The IAEA relies on satellite imagery to monitor sites damaged by airstrikes. While Grossi stated that referring Iran to the UN Security Council is not currently necessary, he stressed that cooperation must improve significantly. Iran suspended its cooperation with the IAEA following the war and has faced strong criticism from Iranian officials toward both the agency and Grossi. In response, European powers invoked the 'snapback mechanism' at the UN, demanding the reimposition of international sanctions due to Iran\u2019s lack of cooperation. The European countries called for Iran to resume talks with the U.S., fully cooperate with the IAEA, and clarify the status of its high-enriched uranium stockpile. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ismail Baghaei, criticized the 'contradictory statements' from IAEA officials, saying they would not serve cooperation. Iran asserts its right to uranium enrichment under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and claims it will not abandon enrichment but is open to discussing potential restrictions. The IAEA previously reported unverified movements at inaccessible nuclear sites and emphasized the need to confirm that enriched uranium has not been diverted for military use. Grossi told the Financial Times that 'the damage was severe, but our available assessment indicates that most, if not all, of the uranium enriched to 60 percent\u2014along with material enriched to 20%, 5%, and 2%\u2014remains present,' adding, 'The material is still there, and although we do not attribute any final purpose to it, the mere availability of highly enriched uranium, approaching weapons-grade, is a source of concern.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 02:04 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://m2.youm7.com/story/2025/11/5/%D9%88%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%86/7185700)\n\n**IAEA urges Iran to step up cooperation**\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief, Rafael Grossi, urged Iran to 'seriously improve' its cooperation with UN nuclear inspectors to prevent escalating tensions with the West, according to a November 5, 2025 report by The Express Tribune citing the Financial Times.

Following a 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2024, which included US airstrikes on Iran\u2019s Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan nuclear sites, Iran has limited engagement with the IAEA. Iranian officials claim the damaged facilities can no longer be monitored under previous inspection frameworks and argue that IAEA reports contributed to the conflict. Although a new cooperation framework was signed in Cairo shortly after the war, Iran withdrew in September 2024 after France, Germany, and the UK activated the sanctions snapback mechanism. Since the war, the IAEA has conducted around a dozen inspections, but access to sensitive nuclear sites remains blocked\u2014only the Bushehr nuclear power plant has been visited, where inspectors observed a routine fuel replacement. Iran has not formally withdrawn from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), but Grossi warned that the status of 408kg of uranium enriched close to weapons-grade levels remains unclear. He stated, 'We should have already resumed the inspection work,' and cautioned that failing to meet NPT obligations cannot be justified by wartime circumstances. Grossi emphasized that even without a declared purpose, highly enriched uranium at 60%, 20%, 5%, and 2% levels poses a serious proliferation risk. He noted that current assessments indicate most or all of this material remains on site, but stressed that cooperation must improve significantly to avoid further diplomatic fallout. While referral to the UN Security Council is currently unnecessary, Grossi warned that continued non-compliance could lead to such action. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei responded on November 4, 2025, stating that 'contradictory remarks' by IAEA officials hinder constructive engagement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/iaea-chief-urges-iran-to-restore-nuclear-transparency-409853/)\n\n**Grossi Warns: Iran Still Holds All Enriched Uranium After Recent Nuclear Strikes**\nRafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned on Wednesday, November 5, 2025, that tensions between Iran and Western countries persist due to Iran's lack of cooperation in inspections of its nuclear facilities.

He emphasized that most of the material is located underground and that Iran has no intention of retrieving it until 'necessary conditions' are met. Araghchi acknowledged uncertainty about how much of the 400 kg survived the attacks, noting that the damage to the facilities, including buildings, equipment, and machinery, was 'significant.' However, he asserted that Iran's uranium enrichment technology remains intact and that 'our will has not disappeared, even after this.' The U.S. joined Israel in the conflict after Israel launched a large-scale attack on Iran on June 13, 2025, targeting nuclear and military sites. The U.S. conducted strikes on facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran took effect on June 24, 2025. While Israel aimed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon\u2014denied by Tehran\u2014the U.S. intelligence found no evidence of such a program. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed the Iranian nuclear program was 'completely destroyed.' However, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed it cannot track the 400 kg of enriched uranium and its director, Rafael Grossi, stated in late June 2025 that Iran could resume enrichment within months. In response to U.S. calls for renewed negotiations, Araghchi said Iran might consider a 'reasonable, balanced, and fair' proposal but reiterated that it would not abandon uranium enrichment.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:20 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/glava-mid-irana-obogasennyj-uran-nahoditsa-pod-ruinami-adernyh-obektov/a-74597484)\n\n**U.N. Watchdog Agency Detects Nuclear Activity in Iran**\nRafael Grossi, Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reported on October 31, 2025, that suspicious activity has been detected at Iran's bombed-out nuclear sites\u2014Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan\u2014following U.S. and Israeli airstrikes in June 2025, which destroyed the facilities after the IAEA censured Iran for violating nuclear non-proliferation obligations. Although there is no evidence that Iran has resumed uranium enrichment, the IAEA believes the 'majority' of Iran's stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium (enriched to 60%) remains intact and likely buried in the ruins of the destroyed sites. Grossi emphasized that the agency is currently inspecting in Iran but not at all required sites, with ongoing discussions to resume access to Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. He noted that while industrial activity is observed at the sites, it does not indicate enrichment work. Grossi stressed the importance of verifying the location and status of the enriched uranium to prevent diversion. He warned that if Iran could resume enrichment from 60% to weapons-grade, it could produce up to ten nuclear warheads. Additionally, European intelligence reports indicate Iran imported 2,000 tons of sodium perchlorate from China\u2014a key component for solid-fuel ballistic missiles\u2014though U.N. sanctions do not explicitly prohibit such imports. Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program, noted that this quantity could fuel around 500 missiles, suggesting Iran is replenishing depleted stockpiles after prior production levels of about 200 missiles per month.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 11:44 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/10/31/u-n-nuclear-watchdog-detects-nuclear-activity-in-iran/)\n\n**IAEA: Iran Has Not Resumed Enrichment, But Activity Detected Near Uranium Stockpile**\nAccording to Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has not resumed uranium enrichment since the outbreak of the war with Israel in June 2024. However, IAEA inspectors have observed activity near facilities storing Iran's 60% enriched uranium stockpile. Grossi previously stated on October 18, 2024, that most of Iran's 60% enriched uranium remained in nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Fordo, and Natanz. These sites were targeted in Israel's 'Rising Lion' operation, which triggered the brief conflict, followed by U.S. strikes using bunker-busting bombs. Grossi confirmed that the facilities were severely damaged but the uranium stock itself was largely unaffected. A leaked IAEA report from September 2024 indicated Iran possessed 440 kilograms of enriched uranium by June 2024; Grossi now estimates this stock at approximately 400 kilograms. Access to the uranium will depend on Iran's willingness to cooperate. Grossi questioned whether the IAEA would be allowed to access the material, whether Iran would retain it, reduce enrichment levels again, or transfer it abroad, emphasizing that dialogue could prevent another round of airstrikes. Iran severed ties with the IAEA after the Israeli and U.S. strikes, then restored relations under a new framework allowing IAEA inspectors to enter nuclear sites only with approval from Iranian security agencies. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced this month that the agreement is no longer valid due to the activation of the European Union's 'trigger mechanism'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 07:35 PM\nSource:[Albawaba](https://www.albawabhnews.com/5285607)\n\n**UN Nuclear Chief Says Iran Isn't Actively Enriching Uranium but Movement Detected Near Stockpile**\nRafael Mariano Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stated during an interview at UN headquarters on October 29, 2025, that Iran is not currently actively enriching uranium, though recent satellite imagery has detected movement around storage sites holding previously enriched uranium. Grossi emphasized that uranium enriched to 60%\u2014which could enable Iran to produce up to 10 nuclear bombs if weaponized\u2014remains in Iran, and the IAEA needs physical access to verify its status and prevent diversion. Despite a recent agreement signed in Cairo to resume cooperation, including inspections, implementation has not yet occurred. The agreement followed Iran\u2019s suspension of cooperation after the June 2025 12-day war with Israel, during which the US conducted strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, including the Fordo facility. Preliminary US intelligence indicated the strikes only delayed Iran\u2019s program by a few months, as the underground infrastructure at Fordo remained intact. The IAEA board had previously censured Iran for noncooperation\u2014the first such action in 20 years\u2014prompting Iran to accuse the agency of aiding Israel and the US, leading to threats against Grossi, who now receives protection from Austria\u2019s Cobra unit. Grossi confirmed that inspectors are currently inside Iran and he maintains 'constant contact' with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, though he stressed that cooperation is not at the required level and that the situation is neither fully denied nor fully compliant. Additionally, UN sanctions have been reimposed under the 'snapback' mechanism due to Iran\u2019s noncompliance, further straining relations. Grossi confirmed there is no active enrichment operation at the Isfahan site as of October 29, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:10 PM\nSource:[Asharq Al-Awsat English](https://english.aawsat.com/node/5202964)\n\n**U.N. atomic watchdog chief said Iran's enriched uranium still under rubble from air attacks**\nAccording to Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), most of Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium\u2014approximately 400 kilograms enriched to 60% (just below weapons-grade)\u2014remains buried under rubble at nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo following Israeli and U.S. airstrikes during a 12-day conflict in June 2025. Grossi stated that while the damage was severe, Iran's technical capabilities, including its centrifuges, remain intact and can be rebuilt. The IAEA confirmed no evidence that Iran intends to build a nuclear bomb, but acknowledged Iran possesses enough enriched uranium for at least 10 nuclear bombs. Satellite imagery from late September and early October indicates recent activity at two of the three tunnel entrances at the Isfahan complex, suggesting preparations for controlled access and enhanced protection against future strikes, according to the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS). ISIS also noted that the U.S. and Israel have not publicly detailed the extent of damage at Isfahan, unlike the Fordo site. The think tank speculated that advanced Joint Multiple Effects Warhead System warheads may have been used on Tomahawk missiles, enhancing bunker-busting capability. Andrea Stricker of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies said Iran would risk military retaliation if it attempted to recover the buried uranium. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Iran will not return to nuclear negotiations with the U.S. under the Trump administration, citing 'excessive demands' and Washington's 'overreach' as reasons for the collapse of prior talks. Iran claims its restrictions on IAEA inspections are due to security concerns, which Grossi acknowledged. Grossi praised Iran's decision not to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty or become a pariah state like North Korea, but warned that failure of diplomacy could lead to renewed military action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 23, 2025 04:06 PM\nSource:[Washington Times](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/oct/23/un-atomic-watchdog-chief-said-irans-enriched-uranium-still-rubble-air/)\n\n**U.N. Nuclear Watchdog Estimates Most of Iran's Uranium Is Intact**\nRafael Grossi, Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), stated on October 21, 2025, that the IAEA believes 'the majority' of Iran's stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium\u2014approximately 400 kilograms enriched to 60% purity\u2014survived U.S. and Israeli airstrikes in June 2025 targeting Iran\u2019s primary nuclear facilities at Isfahan, Fordow, and Natanz. Iranian officials, including Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, confirmed that most of the enriched uranium remains buried in the rubble of these sites. The IAEA has requested access to the uranium but has received limited cooperation from Iran. Satellite imagery analyzed by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) indicates Iran is beginning to excavate tunnels at the Isfahan complex, though the activity appears focused on securing access and reinforcing entrances rather than immediately recovering uranium. FDD non-proliferation expert Andrea Striker noted that while Iran\u2019s ability to enrich the 60% uranium to weapons-grade levels has been disrupted, any recovery effort would risk further military action by the U.S. and Israel. On October 21, 2025, Ali Larijani, Secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, announced Iran had canceled its inspection agreement with the IAEA, ending all cooperation with the agency. Larijani cited the European signatories (France, Germany, and the UK) invoking the 'snapback' mechanism in August 2025\u2014triggered by Iran\u2019s alleged JCPOA violations\u2014as justification, calling the move a 'wrongdoing' and claiming Iran had met all obligations for the past 10 years. The U.N. Security Council imposed snapback sanctions in September 2025, a move endorsed by the U.S. but opposed by China and Russia, which continue to engage with Iran despite the sanctions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 07:51 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2025/10/21/u-n-nuclear-watchdog-estimates-most-of-irans-uranium-is-intact-but-blocked-from-verifying/)\n\n**IAEA chief Rafael Grossi: Iranian enriched uranium stockpile in bombed sites unharmed by US-Israeli airstrikes**\nIAEA Director Rafael Grossi stated in an interview with the Swiss daily Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung that Iran's stockpile of highly enriched uranium, estimated at approximately 400kg prior to the June 2024 airstrikes, remained largely intact despite Israeli and U.S. military strikes on key nuclear facilities in Isfahan, Fordo, Natanz, Arak, Tehran, Karaj, and the SPND headquarters. Grossi confirmed that the majority of the uranium is still located in these facilities, which were heavily damaged but partially underground, making access dependent on Iran's full cooperation\u2014only likely if Iran perceives a national interest. The strikes, conducted by the Israeli Defense Forces using F-15, F-16, and F-35 aircraft, along with drones and precision-guided missiles, and later joined by the U.S. Air Force deploying GBU-57 bunker buster bombs and Tomahawk cruise missiles, caused extensive destruction to smaller sites but failed to significantly damage the deeper, fortified storage areas. Iran's uranium enrichment level has reached 60.8%, nearing the 90% threshold needed for weapons-grade material. Grossi emphasized that concerns over Iran's nuclear ambitions remain unaddressed, especially after the 2015 nuclear deal's termination, the reimposition of international sanctions, and Iran's subsequent freedom to pursue weapons-grade enrichment. He expressed encouragement over U.S. President Donald Trump's recent remarks in the Knesset advocating for diplomacy, stating that while past military actions cannot be undone, renewed dialogue could prevent further conflict. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbass Araghchi confirmed that much of the stockpile remains undamaged beneath rubble, though the IAEA has lost pre-strike knowledge of its condition. The Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran (AEOI) is currently assessing recovery methods, focusing on safety, container volatility, and technological feasibility. The IAEA has not yet regained access to the sites.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 01:13 PM\nSource:[http://www.uniindia.com/fadnavis-orders-probe-into-mumbai-pub-fire/states/news/1090400.html](http://uniindia.com/~/iaea-chief-rafael-grossi-iranian-enriched-uranium-stockpile-in-bombed-sites-unharmed-by-us-israeli-airstrikes/World/news/3616902.html)\n\n**UN nuclear watchdog believes most of Iran's enriched uranium unharmed by war with Israel**\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), led by Director Rafael Grossi, stated that most of Iran's enriched uranium\u2014estimated at approximately 400 kilograms of 60% enriched uranium\u2014remained intact following the 12-day conflict with Israel in June 2025. This assessment is based on a confidential IAEA report showing that Iran possessed 440.9 kilograms (972 pounds) of 60% enriched uranium as of June 13, 2025. Grossi confirmed that the uranium is still located in Iran\u2019s damaged nuclear facilities, including Isfahan, Natanz, and Fordo, which were heavily struck by both Israel and the United States during the conflict. Despite the extensive damage, the IAEA has not been granted access to these sites due to Iran\u2019s suspension of cooperation, which followed the agency\u2019s failure to condemn the Israeli strikes. Iran now requires approval from its security body before allowing inspections, under a new cooperation framework. Grossi emphasized that Iran remains a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and has not withdrawn from negotiations, urging a return to diplomatic talks to prevent further military escalation. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, confirmed that enriched material remains 'under the rubble' of the attacked sites. While Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, it has enriched uranium to levels with no peaceful use, obstructed inspections, and expanded its ballistic missile program, with evidence suggesting it had advanced toward weaponization prior to the June 13 attack.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 03:15 AM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/un-nuclear-watchdog-believes-most-of-irans-enriched-uranium-unharmed-by-war-with-israel/)\n\n**Tehran Approves Resumption of Cooperation with IAEA**\nTehran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) announced that its nuclear committee approved earlier signed agreements to resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Resuming inspections could help Iran avoid new economic sanctions imposed by Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, China and Russia. In 2015 the three European states and the US, China and Russia signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. In 2018 the Trump administration unilaterally withdrew and imposed sanctions. Since then Tehran has gradually abandoned its obligations and resumed uranium enrichment, reportedly exceeding the JCPOA limit fourfold, a claim Iran denies. Cooperation with the IAEA was suspended after a 12\u2011day war in June\u202f2025 when Israel and the US struck Iranian nuclear sites in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan. IAEA inspectors were expelled on 2\u202fJuly by President Masoud Peshgheian. In June\u202f2025 Israel launched a massive attack on Iran, supported by the US, targeting mainly nuclear and military sites; Iran responded with missile and drone strikes. Rafael Grossi has repeatedly urged Tehran to allow inspections of the three damaged sites to assess damage and enriched uranium stockpiles, but the Iranian government has repeatedly refused.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 14, 2025 12:06 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/iran-odobril-soglasenie-o-vozobnovlenii-sotrudnicestva-s-magate/a-73989436)\n\n**Iran says enriched nuclear material 'under rubble' of facilities hit during Israel war | News**\nIran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas\u202fAraghchi said that enriched nuclear material remains \"under the rubble\" of facilities damaged in the 12\u2011day war with Israel. He stated, \"All of our material is\u2026 under the rubble of the bombed facilities,\" and that the Atomic Energy Organization is assessing the stockpile.

He explained that the Iranian Atomic Energy Organization is assessing the extent of damage and the possibility of accessing the material, in preparation for a report to the Supreme National Security Council. This comes amid growing concern in Western countries and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) about the fate of Iran\u2019s enriched uranium after three nuclear sites were targeted in June. Tehran had suspended cooperation with the IAEA after the war but signed a new agreement on Tuesday with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi to resume cooperation. Iracagi said the agreement gives the IAEA the right to inspect 'provided it obtains approval from the Supreme National Security Council', noting that inspectors currently cannot access some of the facilities that were bombed, while the agreement excludes facilities that have not been touched, such as the Bushehr nuclear plant. Grossi announced that the new cooperation framework covers 'all nuclear facilities and infrastructure in Iran', stressing that resuming inspections is essential for the stability of Iran\u2019s nuclear file.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 01:07 AM\nSource:[Albawaba](https://www.albawabhnews.com/5261350)\n\n**Iran enters new nuclear pact with UN for site inspection 3 months after Israel-US strike**\nOn September 11 2025, Iranian and United Nations negotiators announced an agreement to resume IAEA inspections of Iranian nuclear sites, following a Cairo meeting between IAEA head Rafael Grossi and Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi. Grossi said the sides had agreed 'on practical modalities to resume inspection activities in Iran', marking a key step toward restoring oversight after Tehran halted cooperation three months earlier during the 12\u2011day war with Israel and subsequent US\u2011backed Israeli strikes on sites such as Natanz. The deal, brokered with Egyptian mediation, outlines procedures for inspection and notification and addresses facilities struck in June. Iran had halted inspections after the attacks, which involved heavy bunker\u2011busting bombs, and had amassed more than 880 pounds of highly enriched uranium, enough to produce multiple weapons if further processed. Western diplomats say the agreement may help avert a new sanctions crisis, as Britain, France and Germany had threatened to activate the 2015 nuclear accord's 'snapback' mechanism. Iranian officials, including spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei, view the pact as necessary amid the 'new situation' created by the attacks, but warned it could be voided if facilities were attacked again or if UN Security Council resolutions were reinstated. The IAEA remains concerned about Iran's growing stockpile, and the agreement provides a fragile pathway back to limited transparency, though experts note it may not resolve deeper disputes over enrichment limits or the legacy of the 2015 accord.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 11, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/world/iran-nuclear-weapons-iran-israel-war-iaea-abbas-araghchi-13932576.html)\n\n**Iran Increased Near-Weapons-Grade Uranium Stockpile Ahead Of Israel Strike, Says IAEA**\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) released a confidential report indicating that Iran had increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons\u2011grade levels just before Israel\u2019s airstrike campaign on June\u202f13,\u202f2025. The report, circulated among IAEA member states and obtained by the Associated Press, covers Iran\u2019s nuclear activities between May\u202f17 and June\u202f12,\u202f2025. It states that as of June\u202f13, Iran possessed 440.9\u202fkilograms (972\u202fpounds) of uranium enriched up to 60\u202f% purity, an increase of 32.3\u202fkilograms (71.2\u202fpounds) since the previous report in May. The IAEA emphasised that this data is 'based on the information provided by Iran, agency verification activities between the above provided dates, and estimates based on the past operation of the relevant facilities.' Enrichment to 60\u202f% brings Iran alarmingly close to weapons\u2011grade uranium, which requires 90\u202f% purity; experts note that approximately 42\u202fkilograms of 60\u202f% enriched uranium, if further enriched, could be enough to produce one atomic bomb. The report also notes that no agreement has been reached with Iran to resume inspections at nuclear sites damaged during Israeli and U.S. airstrikes in June, leaving the extent of the damage uncertain. Israel has justified its targeted strikes on Iranian military and nuclear facilities by arguing it cannot allow Tehran to develop nuclear weapons. Israeli officials have expressed growing alarm over Iran\u2019s nuclear progress, while Iran insists its program is entirely peaceful and for civilian purposes. On June\u202f22, the U.S. joined the offensive, deploying bunker\u2011buster bombs against suspected Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran\u2019s newly elected president, Masoud\u202fPezeshkian, signed a law on July\u202f2, passed by the Iranian Parliament, suspending all cooperation with the IAEA. Since then, the only site the IAEA has accessed is the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, where inspectors observed a fuel replacement procedure on August\u202f27 and 28. The IAEA expressed alarm in its report, stating inspectors have not been able to verify Iran\u2019s near bomb\u2011grade uranium stockpile for over two and a half months, calling it 'a matter of serious concern.' Iran remains legally obligated to cooperate with the IAEA under the Treaty on the Non\u2011Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 03, 2025 08:38 PM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/world/iran-increased-near-weapons-grade-uranium-stockpile-ahead-of-israel-strike-says-iaea-ws-l-9547861.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts agree that, as of early November 2025, Iran is not allowing IAEA inspectors access to its stockpile of enriched uranium at the Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan sites, and has recently moved further from cooperation following military strikes and the snapback of UN sanctions. Across diverse perspectives\u2014nuclear policy, diplomacy, international relations theory, security studies, and Middle East regional analysis\u2014the consensus is that the base rate for rapid restoration of IAEA inspections after major crisis is very low. Experts highlight that the short time window (less than two months), Iran\u2019s domestic hardline politics, the technical obstacles at the bombed sites, and the regime\u2019s need to maintain deterrence and resist perceived humiliation all strongly decrease the probability of a sudden reversal. While the risk of renewed Israeli or US military action, ongoing diplomatic pressure (especially from China and Russia), and the IAEA\u2019s willingness to accept symbolic or partial access could, in theory, prompt a last-minute face-saving agreement, most forecasters see these factors as insufficient to overcome entrenched resistance in the absence of significant new incentives or crises. Across all fields, the most common forecast is a low but non-zero chance\u2014typically between 8% and 15%\u2014that Iran will announce an inspection agreement before January 1, 2026, with only one (Constructivist) outlier slightly higher at 25%. The overwhelming expert judgment is that the status quo (continued denial of IAEA access before 2026) will hold unless there is an unexpected and dramatic diplomatic, military, or economic development.",
