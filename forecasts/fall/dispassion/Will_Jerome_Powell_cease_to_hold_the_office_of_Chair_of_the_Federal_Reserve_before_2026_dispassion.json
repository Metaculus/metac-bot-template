            "response": "The Institutionalism forecast rightly emphasizes the strength of formal rules and historical precedent, but it could give greater weight to how economic and political cycles interact to create windows of heightened risk. Political Business Cycle Theory suggests that during periods of major electoral or executive transition\u2014especially under a leader with demonstrated willingness to test institutional boundaries\u2014the probability of deviation from precedent, while still low, rises nontrivially. The Trump administration's rapid succession planning, ongoing legal battles over agency independence, and repeated public pressure on Powell are all signals that the political business cycle is amplifying institutional stress. While the probability of early departure remains low, a 7% estimate may still understate the tail risk posed by this specific confluence of political incentives and institutional challenge. A slightly higher estimate (e.g., 8\u201312%) would better reflect the current period's unusual volatility without overstating the threat."

The defense of a 6-10% range as a reasonable middle ground is reinforced, and the consensus is that the status quo is extremely likely to persist.

While the consensus remains that the probability is very low, there is a reasonable case for acknowledging slightly greater uncertainty than my initial estimate.

However, no new concrete evidence or scenario emerged that would materially raise the odds above 'very low.' The strongest argument for a modest upward revision is the acknowledgment that this is a period of slightly elevated institutional stress and legal volatility, which could marginally increase tail risk.

Yardeni praised Powell for navigating a series of 'unprecedented challenges,' including the pandemic, inflation shock, and political pressure to cut interest rates, calling his performance 'very good' given the circumstances. However, Yardeni warned that a Trump-aligned successor could pursue a more dovish monetary policy, potentially facing opposition from other Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. He cautioned that if the new chair were overruled in a vote, the resulting internal division would be unprecedented and could severely damage the Fed's credibility. Yardeni also warned that if a Trump-leaning chair cuts rates without supporting economic data, 'bond vigilantes'\u2014a term for investors who react aggressively to perceived fiscal irresponsibility\u2014could push bond yields higher, as they did in late 2023. He noted that the Fed is currently operating 'in the fog' during the ongoing government shutdown, relying on private-sector data to guide decisions. Yardeni interpreted Powell's latest comments as suggesting a possible pause in rate cuts at the December meeting.

According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the candidate pool has been reduced to five individuals: current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Bessent stated he has conducted interviews and expects to present a 'strong list' to Trump after Thanksgiving. President Donald Trump confirmed he expects to name a successor by the end of the year. Powell\u2019s current term ends in May 2024, and he may either step down entirely or remain as Chair until 2028. Trump currently has three appointed members on the seven-member Board of Governors: Waller, Bowman, and Stephen Moore, whose term ends in January. Moore is expected to be confirmed as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. If Powell departs, Trump would appoint four new members. Trump has so far failed to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Five regional Fed presidents join the Board in voting on the Federal Open Market Committee. Financial expert Mohamed Saeed noted to 'Economy Sky News Arabia' that the selection will have significant implications for U.S. fiscal policy, inflation risks, and the future of public debt.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 12:50 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0629](http://akhbarak.net/news/details/48089811/23/%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%82-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%B9)\n\n**The Race to Succeed Jerome Powell: A Political and Economic Battle for the Fed's Future**\nThe United States is approaching a critical moment in its monetary policy as Jerome Powell's term as Chair of the Federal Reserve ends in May 2026. With the presidential administration under Donald Trump already advancing the selection process for his successor, the race has transformed from a technical appointment into a high-stakes political and economic battle. The list of candidates has been narrowed to five by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman (current Federal Reserve Governors), Kevin Hassett (White House Economic Council Director), Kevin Warsh (former Fed Governor), and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Trump has indicated he expects to name a successor by year-end, despite Bessent stating he is not pursuing the role himself. The appointment process is significant because of concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve, especially given Trump\u2019s past criticisms of Powell and his push for faster interest rate cuts. Experts, including financial analyst Mohamed Saeed and global markets head Joe Yarq, warn that political interference could undermine market credibility, increase inflation risks, and trigger financial instability. However, with inflation near the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the new chair may face a more stable environment. Trump has also reportedly considered Bessent for the role, though Bessent has downplayed the possibility. The outcome will shape the balance between monetary independence and political influence in the U.S. economy.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1830242-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%94%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%9F)\n\n**Fed Chair Shortlist Finalized: Five Candidates in Race, Trump Pushes for New Nominee**\nOn October 28, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was 'ineffective' and announced that a new chair would be appointed when Powell's term ends in May 2026. Trump previously called for Powell's resignation and demanded a 300-basis-point rate cut, though the Fed is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its October 29 meeting\u2014marking the second consecutive rate reduction. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the shortlist for the Fed chair has been narrowed to five candidates: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both current Federal Reserve Board members; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director; and Rick Rieder, a BlackRock executive. Bessent plans to conduct interviews and submit a 'high-quality candidate list' to Trump by late November. Trump indicated he expects to finalize the nominee before the end of 2025. Analysts note that Trump\u2019s urgency may stem from the fact that although Powell\u2019s chairmanship ends in May 2026, he could remain on the Fed Board until January 2028, limiting Trump\u2019s ability to appoint a new board member in the interim.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 12:33 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20251029/48945461.html)\n\n**5 Finalists Named for New Fed Chair; Trump to Decide by End of 2025**\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the list of five candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026.

Bessent, who leads the search, previously criticized the Fed\u2019s policies from the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis through the pandemic era. Trump also reiterated his criticism of Powell, calling him 'not smart at all' and claiming he should have lowered interest rates earlier.

Bessent, leading the search, plans to conduct second-round interviews in the coming weeks and provide President Donald Trump with a 'good state' of candidates, likely after Thanksgiving, with Trump expected to make a final selection by the end of 2025. Bessent has criticized the Federal Reserve for continuing unconventional policies, including Treasury bond purchases to lower long-term interest rates, and called for an 'honest, independent, and nonpartisan review' of the institution. His remarks come amid Trump\u2019s frequent criticism of Powell, whom he accused of slow rate cuts, stating, 'He should have been much lower, much sooner.' Trump also attempted to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to create a vacancy. The Fed is expected to cut its key rate again on Wednesday, marking the second cut of the year. Powell\u2019s chair term ends in May 2026, but he may remain on the board until January 2028, which could delay Trump\u2019s nomination process.

Bessent stated that a second round of interviews will be conducted next month, and the final candidate list will be submitted to President Trump shortly after Thanksgiving (November 27, 2025). President Trump confirmed that the new Fed chair will be announced before the end of 2025. Both Waller and Bowman were originally appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term.

President Trump stated he expects to announce the final appointment before the end of 2025. The first round of interviews has been completed, with a second round scheduled after the Thanksgiving holiday, after which a final recommendation will be submitted to Trump. Bessent clarified he is not among the candidates.

Miran, whose term ends in January 2026, is not expected to be reappointed and currently serves as Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, advocating for more aggressive monetary easing.

Despite previous attempts to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, Trump has not succeeded.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the second round of screening is underway and expressed hope to present a strong shortlist to the president shortly after Thanksgiving (November 27, 2024). The White House previously revealed 11 candidates in August, with Kevin Hassett, Chair of the National Economic Council (NEC), Christopher Waller, a Federal Reserve Board member, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed board member, emerging as the most prominent contenders. Trump has consistently criticized Powell throughout 2024, calling him a 'stubborn fool,' 'dummy,' and 'disaster' on social media, accusing him of being overly cautious in lowering interest rates. This sustained pressure is widely interpreted as part of a strategic effort to diminish Powell\u2019s influence and install a more compliant Fed leadership. Trump has already advanced his 'pro-Trump' faction by appointing Stephen Meyer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), to replace Democratic appointee Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August. Current Fed board members Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both appointed during Trump\u2019s first term, have publicly supported rate cuts in alignment with Trump\u2019s stance since July. Additionally, Trump notified Lisa Cook, another Fed board member, of her dismissal in late August; although a lawsuit is ongoing and she remains in office, the possibility of her removal by the U.S. Supreme Court would further strengthen the pro-Trump majority on the board.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 08:10 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uad6d\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/A2025102715450005876)\n\n**UPDATE 1-Bessent says he plans to present Fed chief candidates to Trump in December | Law-Order**\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on October 15, 2025, at a CNBC event during the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington that he plans to present three to four candidates to President Donald Trump for the next Federal Reserve chair position after the Thanksgiving holiday in late November. Bessent narrowed the list from 11 to five finalists to succeed Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. The selection process, which may extend into 2026 due to the need for Senate confirmation, is closely watched globally as it could allow Trump to influence the Fed\u2019s independence. Bessent noted the process would likely resume after Trump\u2019s Asia trip, with candidate interviews expected in December. When asked about Trump\u2019s demand for lower interest rates, Bessent stated that 'one of the criteria is to have an open mind.' Trump has previously criticized Powell and attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook over unproven allegations, a case now before the Supreme Court. Among the five finalists are two current Fed board members appointed by Trump: Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller. The other three are National Economic Council Chair Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock\u2019s Rick Rieder. Choosing a non-board member would require a vacant seat, with Miran\u2019s seat expiring in January 2026.

However, legally, Trump cannot fire Powell, as Fed governors are only removable 'for cause,' as determined by law. Powell's term as chairman is set to end in May 2026.

Trump has been dissatisfied with Powell's decision not to lower interest rates and has been urging him to resign for months. Trump mentioned that the 2.5 billion dollar renovation of the Federal Reserve building in Washington could be a reason for Powell's removal. When asked if Powell could be replaced due to the renovation costs exceeding budget, Trump replied, 'I think so.' Trump cannot fire Powell due to disagreements over monetary policy, as he appointed Powell as Chairman during his first term and reappointed him during President Biden's term.

Powell's term as a Fed governor does not end until January 2028, leaving it possible for him to remain at the central bank. Bessent also mentioned that 'there's a formal process that's already starting' to identify the next Fed chair, with 'a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve.' When asked if President Donald Trump has asked him to serve as Fed chair, Bessent replied, 'I am part of the decision-making process.' Trump has made clear that he wants Powell's successor to be someone who favours lowering interest rates. Bessent noted that Trump has said 'numerous times he is not going to fire Jay Powell.' Potential contenders to succeed Powell as chair include former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, Trump's current National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, and Bessent himself. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 11:55 PM\nSource:[The Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/bessent-suggests-powell-should-leave-federal-reserve-board-may)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all experts, there is strong consensus that Jerome Powell will remain Chair of the Federal Reserve through at least January 1, 2026, with probabilities of an early departure ranging from 2% to 10%. Experts with specializations in US public administration, central banking, political science, economics, and American governance all point to substantial legal, institutional, and historical barriers to removal or resignation before Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026. The main factors decreasing the likelihood of Powell leaving early are the strict legal requirement for removal ('for cause'), robust institutional norms protecting central bank independence, and a historical base rate showing that Fed Chairs almost never leave mid-term absent health issues or scandal. While several experts acknowledge that President Trump and his administration are actively preparing for Powell\u2019s succession and have made public criticisms, all reporting and public statements\u2014including from Trump\u2014indicate no intent to attempt removal before the scheduled term end. The possibility of a 'Yes' outcome rests on highly improbable scenarios such as a sudden health crisis, unforeseen personal scandal, or a successful and unprecedented legal challenge enabling early removal. Overall, the group\u2019s analysis concludes that, barring an extraordinary black swan event, Powell will not cease to be Chair before January 1, 2026, and the probability of such an event is minimal.",
