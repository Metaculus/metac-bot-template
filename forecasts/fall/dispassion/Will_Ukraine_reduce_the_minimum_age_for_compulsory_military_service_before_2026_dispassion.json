The draft aims to provide a 12-month deferment from military conscription for certain categories of citizens, specifically military conscripts and reservists aged 18 to 25 who served a one-year contract during the state of war and were subsequently discharged. Under the proposed law, these individuals may only be conscripted during mobilization with their explicit consent during the 12-month deferment period. The need for this legal amendment arises from a gap in current legislation: after completing their one-year contract, these young citizens lose their deferment rights until they reach 25, leaving them vulnerable to immediate mobilization upon re-registration. The law seeks to resolve this legal contradiction and allow former contract soldiers time to reintegrate. The Verkhovna Rada also passed draft Law No. 12094 to improve mobile connectivity and ensure fast, stable internet nationwide. Additionally, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed laws extending the state of war and general mobilization for 90 days, effective until at least February 3, 2026. An update to the 'Rezerv+' app now allows single parents raising a child to obtain an online deferment if the other parent has died or lost parental rights.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/country/society/rada-pidtrimala-zakonoprojekt-shchodo-novoji-vidstrochki-shcho-vidomo-1086662.html)\n\n**Zelenskyy Signs Law on Temporary Reserve for OPK Workers Facing Conscription Issues**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed a law enabling the temporary reserve status of employees from the Military-Industrial Complex (OPK) who face issues with military conscription. According to Ukrinform, citing the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) website, the law applies to personnel from defense industry companies deemed critical, even if they are not registered, have outdated personal data, or hold incorrectly issued documents. These employees may be temporarily exempted from mobilization for up to 45 days per year to resolve their conscription paperwork. This exemption is limited to once annually. If the employee fails to rectify their military service documents during this period, the employer has the right to terminate their employment.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[Ukrainian National News Agency - German](https://www.ukrinform.de/rubric-society/4054484-selenskyj-unterzeichnet-gesetz-uber-vorlaufige-reservierung-von-opkmitarbeitern.html)\n\n**Zelensky Approves New Rules for Conscription of Defense Industry Workers: Can Violators of Military Registration Be Recruited?**\nPresident Vladimir Zelensky signed Law No. 4630-IX, which allows the conscription (bronirovaniye) of employees at defense and critical infrastructure enterprises even if they have violations in military registration. The law expands employers' ability to conscript workers during wartime, permitting conscription regardless of whether employees have no military ID, incomplete personal data, are wanted by authorities, or have improperly issued military documents. The conscription period is up to 45 calendar days from the date of the employment contract and can occur no more than once per year. The law does not exempt employees from responsibility for registration violations; employers may terminate employees who fail to correct these issues within the set timeframe. Additionally, the law introduces a probationary period of up to 45 days for new employees in the defense-industrial complex. The measure aims to stabilize defense production and maintain workforce continuity amid ongoing war. The law applies to all military-duty personnel working in critical institutions, regardless of prior conscription status. This policy reflects the state's focus on preserving human capital in defense and strategically vital sectors. The law was previously approved by Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada, as reported by Dialog.UA, a key source for Ukrainian news and civic information.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433.UA](https://www.dialog.ua/ukraine/323324_1762168254)\n\n**Zelenskyy Signs Law on Temporary Reservation of Military-Conscription Workers in Defense and Critical Enterprises**\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Law No. 4630-IX on November 3, 2025, which establishes temporary reservation (bronirovanie) for military conscripts on defense and critical infrastructure enterprises during a state of war. The law, introduced through draft bill No. 13335 submitted on May 30, was adopted in principle by the Verkhovna Rada on September 3 and passed in full on October 9. It was returned to the parliament with the president's signature on October 31. The law mandates that individuals working in the defense-industrial complex (OPK) or critical infrastructure are reserved for a period of 45 days from the signing of their employment contracts. This reservation applies only once per year and does not exempt individuals from military accountability. The law specifies a maximum probationary period of 45 days, during which employers may terminate employees who fail to resolve military registration issues in time.

The Verkhovna Rada passed draft law \u211613574, granting a 12-month deferment from mobilization to military personnel aged 18\u201325 who served under a one-year contract during martial law, aiming to protect youth and prevent immediate re-mobilization. The law, if adopted, will amend Article 23 of the Law on Mobilization Preparation and Mobilization, with implementation expected after official publication. The process now requires applicants to submit documents via Centralized National Application Points (\u0426\u041d\u0410\u041f\u044b), not directly to Territorial Centers of Conscription and Social Support (\u0422\u0426\u041a). Documents are scanned and sent electronically to \u0422\u0426\u041a and the Service of Decision-Making (\u0421\u041f), with decisions communicated through the 'Reserv+' app. Deferments are automatically renewed for those with valid data in the registry and the 'Reserv+' app, provided the original deferment was granted before November 5, 2025. However, according to lawyer Darya Tarasenko, the Ministry of Defense\u2019s interpretation\u2014requiring confirmed data in the registry\u2014contradicts the government\u2019s official decree, which states that most deferments (except for reserved and officials) are automatically renewed based on previously submitted documents. If data are outdated or missing, individuals must reapply via \u0426\u041d\u0410\u041f. The list of 10 online deferment types available in 'Reserv+' remains unchanged, including disability, fatherhood of a child with a disability, large family status, and student/graduate status. Paper certificates have been abolished, with the electronic military record in 'Reserv+' serving as the sole proof. The Ministry of Defense advises that if automatic renewal fails, it indicates outdated or missing data, requiring updates or reapplication. Experts emphasize that 'automatic renewal' applies only to existing deferments, not new applications, and recommend checking deferment status on November 5 to avoid issues.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 04:19 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/ukrayina/otsrochka-ot-mobilizatsii-v-noyabre-novye-pravila-avtomaticheskoe-prodlenie-i-klyuchevye-izmeneniya-2949701.html)\n\n**Zelensky's Military Contract Initiative: New Incentives for Armed Forces \u2013 What\u2019s Real and What\u2019s Missing?**\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky and Minister of Defense Denys Shmyhal announced on October 3, 2024, a new initiative to introduce military contracts ranging from one to five years, aimed at improving retention and motivation among Ukrainian servicemen.

Soldiers signing contracts for two to five years will receive a one-year deferment from mobilization after their service ends. The initiative is open not only to new recruits but also to those already serving under mobilization, who may also qualify for a one-time allowance. According to Ivan Kru\u043b\u044cko, First Deputy Head of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Budget, the draft law has not yet been submitted to parliament, and no specific amounts have been confirmed. While social media circulated figures suggesting one-time payments of 530,000 UAH for a one-year contract up to 3.65 million UAH for a five-year contract, Kru\u043b\u044cko described these as 'general ideas' subject to change. He emphasized that no funds for this initiative are currently allocated in the next year\u2019s state budget and stressed the need to secure financial resources, including from frozen Russian assets, through European partners. Kru\u043b\u044cko argued that financial incentives are more effective than forced conscription and are essential to strengthen support for military personnel.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/ukraine/politics/viplati-viyskovim-i-novi-kontrakti-deputat-nazvav-sumi-shcho-zminyat-i-na-yakiy-stadiji-iniciativa-50558004.html)\n\n**Verkhovna Rada Supports Draft Law on New Deferment: What Is Known**\nThe Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine supported draft Law No. 13574 'On amending Article 23 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Mobilization Preparation and Mobilization' in its first reading. The draft aims to provide a 12-month deferment from military conscription for certain categories of citizens, specifically military conscripts and reservists aged 18 to 25 who served a one-year contract during the state of war and were subsequently discharged. Under the proposed law, these individuals may only be conscripted during mobilization with their explicit consent during the 12-month deferment period. The need for this legal amendment arises from a gap in current legislation: after completing their one-year contract, these young citizens lose their deferment rights until they reach 25, leaving them vulnerable to immediate mobilization upon re-registration. The law seeks to resolve this legal contradiction and allow former contract soldiers time to reintegrate. The Verkhovna Rada also passed draft Law No. 12094 to improve mobile connectivity and ensure fast, stable internet nationwide. Additionally, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed laws extending the state of war and general mobilization for 90 days, effective until at least February 3, 2026.

The state of war has been in effect since February 24, 2022, and the universal mobilization was introduced shortly after. The extension was confirmed by Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada via its Telegram channel and supported by Deputy Yaroslav Zheleznyak. The mobilization law has been tightened since last May, with exemptions removed and the conscription age range expanded to include men from 25 to 60 years old. Due to ongoing personnel shortages in the Armed Forces, discussions are intensifying about potentially conscripting women, particularly those with medical and pharmaceutical training, who could serve in non-combat roles to free up men for frontline combat. As of October 1, 2024, Ukrainian women with medical and pharmaceutical education are required to register for military service. Some lawmakers have proposed extending conscription to all women regardless of profession.

The legislation, passed by the State Duma in its final reading, will allow conscription offices to summon draftees for medical exams and administrative procedures at any time of year. Once signed by President Vladimir Putin and approved by the upper house, the law will not change the timing of actual military service, which will remain limited to a few spring and summer months. Currently, Russian men aged 18\u201330 are required to serve one year of military service, though many avoid it through deferments for students, health conditions, or other reasons. The military has called up between 130,000 and 160,000 draftees per conscription cycle. Authorities claim draftees are not deployed to Ukraine, relying instead on volunteers and mobilized reservists, though human rights groups and media reports suggest draftees are often pressured or coerced into signing volunteer contracts. Russia\u2019s military strength has grown from 1 million in 2022 to 1.5 million active troops, with over 700,000 reportedly fighting in Ukraine. To combat draft evasion, authorities launched an electronic conscription register and imposed penalties such as bank transaction bans, driver\u2019s license suspensions, and travel restrictions. After the unpopular partial mobilization of 300,000 reservists in 2022, which triggered mass emigration, the Kremlin shifted focus to attracting volunteers\u2014440,000 joined in 2024 and 336,000 signed contracts in 2025. A separate bill passed Tuesday mandates that only voluntary active reservists can be assigned to protect 'critically important facilities' from Ukrainian drones that have penetrated over 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) into Russian territory. The Kremlin continues to reject U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s call for a ceasefire and maintains its maximalist demands, including Ukraine\u2019s withdrawal from four annexed regions, which Kyiv and its Western allies have rejected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 06:23 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/russia-military-conscription-draft-ukraine-war-9849511e45f7b7db596103fd71e69bae)\n\n**Ukraine Considers Lowering Mobilization Age to 23 Amid Infantry Shortage**\nUkraine continues to operate under a state of war and general mobilization, with conscription currently applying to men aged 25 to 60 who are medically fit and without deferments or exemptions. However, officials and military leaders indicate that the mobilization age may be reduced to 23 in 2026 due to a critical shortage of infantry on the front lines. Captain 'Kham' of the 29th Separate Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade stated that reducing the mobilization age to 23 is 'almost inevitable' due to insufficient personnel, emphasizing that 'without infantry, it's impossible to hold the front line.' Legal expert Marina Bekalo confirmed that lowering the mobilization age to 23 is legally feasible by amending Article 37 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Military Duty and Military Service' to include men at age 23 in the conscription register. The process would require a bill to pass through all stages in the Verkhovna Rada, presidential signature, and official publication. As of October 15, 2025, no such bill has been registered. The Office of the President, represented by Deputy Head Pavel Palisa, stated that reducing the mobilization age is not under consideration before September 2025, citing concerns over public reaction and the need to prevent families from sending minors abroad to avoid conscription. Former Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba believes any reduction would likely be gradual\u2014by 1\u20132 years\u2014rather than immediate to 18, and warned that such a move would be deeply unpopular across Ukrainian society. International partners, including the U.S., have urged Ukraine to expand mobilization to men aged 18\u201325, referencing the Vietnam War, and have offered full equipment support if such a move is made. However, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy rejected the idea of lowering the age to 18, stressing that untrained or poorly equipped young soldiers are not a solution; instead, he emphasized the need to properly equip existing units. Despite ongoing discussions and international pressure, no legislative proposals to reduce the mobilization age have been formally introduced as of October 15, 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 03:43 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/exclusive/mobilizatsiya-po-novomu-v-ukraine-hotyat-snizit-prizyvnoy-vozrast-do-23-let-vse-chto-izvestno-2934575.html)\n\n**Ukraine Considers Lowering Mobilization Age to 23 Amid Infantry Shortage**\nUkraine is currently under a state of war and general mobilization, with military conscription applying to men aged 25 to 60 who are fit for service and without deferments.

According to '\u0425\u0410\u041c', a commander of the 29th separate anti-aircraft missile brigade, lowering the mobilization age to 23 is nearly inevitable due to the lack of personnel and the need to maintain the front line. Legal changes to implement this would require amending Article 37 of the Law of Ukraine 'On Military Duty and Military Service' to include 23-year-old men in the conscription register. This process would involve drafting a bill, passing it through all stages in the Verkhovna Rada, presidential approval, and official publication. As of October 15, 2025, no such bills have been registered. Legal expert Marina Bekalo notes that while reducing the mobilization age to 23 is realistic, further reduction to 18 is theoretically possible but unlikely to be widely accepted by Ukrainian society. Senior officials, including Deputy Head of the Office of the President Pavlo Palisa, state that as of September 2025, the issue is not under active consideration. Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy has reiterated that Ukraine will not reduce the mobilization age to 18, emphasizing the need to first ensure proper equipment for existing units. International partners, particularly the U.S., have urged Ukraine to expand mobilization to include men aged 18\u201325, citing historical examples like the Vietnam War. The U.S. has offered full equipment support if such a move is made, but Zelenskyy argues that the priority should be equipping existing units rather than relying on younger recruits.

Since February 24, 2022, Ukraine has been under martial law, and on the next day, Vladimir Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. In the spring of 2024, Zelensky signed a law reducing the mobilization age in Ukraine from 27 to 25 years. Later, former US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan stated that the authorities in Kiev would have to make a decision to lower the mobilization age to 18 years. The law on the strengthening of mobilization, which came into force in Ukraine on May 18, 2024, requires all conscripts to update their data in the military commissariat. This can be done by visiting the military commissariat in person or registering in the 'electronic cabinet of the conscript.' The summons will be considered delivered, even if the conscript did not see it personally: the date of 'delivery' of the summons will be considered the date when the stamp about the impossibility of personal delivery was made in the document. The law states that conscripts must constantly carry a military ID and present it upon request to military commissariat staff, police. The demobilization terms are not specified in the document.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 19, 2025 11:21 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250719/rada-2030144779.html)\n\n**Ukraine Launches Automated System for Military Service Registration**\nUkrainian lawyer Yuri Tanasychuk announced that Kiev has launched an automated system to register young people aged 17-25 for military service in Ukraine. The system, called 'Opiryeg', is synchronized with state records and automatically records data of those called for military service without their presence. Tanasychuk said, 'This concerns the category of people eligible for military service - young people aged 17-25. The 'Opiryeg' system uses data from records, especially from the State Migration Service, to register eligible individuals automatically.' If it is determined that a person is not fit for military service due to health reasons or other reasons, they must personally visit the military registration and enlistment office to correct the data and explain their reasons. The martial law was imposed in Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and the next day, Volodymyr Zelensky signed a decree on general mobilization. In the spring of 2024, Zelensky signed a law reducing the conscription age in Ukraine from 27 to 25 years. Later, former US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan stated that the authorities in Kiev will have to make a decision to lower the conscription age to 18 years.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 13, 2025 06:08 PM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1692239-%D8%A5%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B3%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%84-%D8%A2%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all experts, there is a strong consensus that the probability of Ukraine reducing the minimum age for compulsory military service below 25 before 2026 is very low. Experts from fields including military policy, Ukrainian law, political science, international relations, and East European studies all highlight several converging factors: \n\n1. Legislative Inertia and Timeline: No bill to lower the age is currently registered or in process, and the Ukrainian legislative process typically takes weeks to months, making rapid passage highly implausible with less than two months before the deadline.\n\n2. Political and Social Resistance: Both public opinion and elite signals\u2014including repeated statements from President Zelensky\u2014indicate strong opposition to lowering the age below 25, citing risks of public backlash, draft evasion, and societal unrest.\n\n3. Recent Policy Focus: Legislative and executive actions since the last reduction (from 27 to 25, enacted in April 2024) have centered on streamlining deferments, improving contract incentives, and administrative/registration reforms, not on further reducing the age threshold.\n\n4. International Pressure: While the US and Western partners have called for lowering the age (sometimes to 18), and have offered material support, Ukrainian leaders have emphasized their sovereign decision-making and have not yielded to this pressure to date.\n\n5. War Situation: Severe manpower shortages at the front are widely acknowledged and might, in theory, prompt emergency action. However, all experts note that only a catastrophic and sudden collapse on the battlefield could override domestic and institutional opposition\u2014no such crisis is currently evident in open sources.\n\n6. Base Rates/Precedent: Historical experience in Ukraine and comparable countries shows that major, rapid policy changes to conscription age are rare, even under existential threat.\n\nThe only scenarios envisioned in which the minimum age is lowered before 2026 require a dramatic and unforeseen military emergency resulting in a government decision to pass emergency legislation in a matter of weeks\u2014an outcome considered highly improbable by all experts. Final probabilities provided by experts mostly range between 5% and 12%, with the modal estimate at 7-8%. In conclusion, based on all expert perspectives, the outlook is overwhelmingly against a formal reduction of Ukraine's minimum conscription age before January 1, 2026.",
