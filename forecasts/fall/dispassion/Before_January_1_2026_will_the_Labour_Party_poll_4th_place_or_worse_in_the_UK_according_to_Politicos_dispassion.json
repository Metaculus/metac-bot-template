The risk of further bad news for Labour before year-end is high, and the polling averages of the four main parties (Reform, Labour, Conservatives, Greens) are now close enough that even modest shifts could drop Labour to 4th in the Politico average. On the other hand, averages are sticky and tend to smooth out brief outlier results; if Labour rebounds even slightly or if the Greens/Conservatives plateau, Labour could avoid 4th in the average.

Additionally, with all four major parties now close in the polls, minor fluctuations, sampling error, or a single poll with less dramatic results could prevent Labour from dipping to fourth in the average, even if only briefly. Moreover, there's a non-trivial chance of a temporary rebound or campaign event (e.g., leadership challenge, messaging shift) moving Labour up a point or two in the short run.

While you correctly note the smoothing and lag in averages, the convergence of polling firms and the sharpness of the decline mean that the average is very likely to register this unprecedented event, even if briefly. In the context of the Westminster model, once a party's collapse reaches this breadth and depth\u2014and with no general election to force strategic voter realignment for years\u2014there is little to cushion against further drops. Your scenario where Labour avoids fourth place in the average would require either a rapid, coordinated positive polling swing or abrupt stasis among rivals, neither of which is supported by current dynamics.

The few relatively lower forecasts (e.g., 65%, 75%) were consistently critiqued for underweighting the evidence: multiple reputable polls now show Labour at or near fourth, with a persistent, deep, and broad-based collapse in support. The mechanics of the Politico average, while smoothing volatility, are likely to reflect the current trend, especially if further negative shocks (Budget, leadership crisis) occur. The inertia of the Westminster system and historical base rate are important, but the unprecedented nature, multi-poll corroboration, and lack of imminent positive reversal mean the outcome is highly probable. The only plausible 'No' scenario would require an immediate, significant Labour polling recovery or a sudden drop for rivals, neither of which is indicated. Therefore, in light of the overwhelming evidence and group consensus, I am revising upward to align with the top of the expert range.",

But he is not surprised: Thanks to Britain\u2019s electoral system, Labour won about two-thirds of seats with just one-third of the votes cast. Accounting for low turnout, Curtice said just one in five Britons voted for Starmer\u2019s Labour Party.

The potential challenge could be triggered two weeks after Rachel Reeves, the UK's Chancellor of the Exchequer, delivers her budget statement to the House of Commons on November 26, 2025. Reeves is expected to announce unpopular tax increases to address the budget deficit, which could fuel internal dissent. Potential challengers include Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care Wes Streeting. However, Starmer is reportedly determined to resist such efforts, with one unnamed minister stating that it would be 'madness' to challenge him just 17 months after he led Labour to a general election victory. Critics claim Starmer's office has entered 'a defensive mode' and that internal challenges will not help the government overcome its current political difficulties. A November 2025 Ipsos poll cited by The Daily Telegraph found that only 20% of respondents approve of Starmer\u2019s performance, while 60% view it negatively. Reeves herself acknowledged on November 4 that Labour may break its pre-election promise not to raise income, VAT, and social security taxes due to significant external economic pressures, including US tariffs and the war in Ukraine. A YouGov poll released in November 2025 showed Reform UK leading with 27% support, followed by Labour at 19%, and Conservative and Green parties each at 16%.

Allies say he is aware of the growing threat to his position and is actively strengthening support among MPs. Starmer has warned ministers that a leadership challenge would destabilize the economy, unsettle bond markets, and harm international relations with allies such as the US and the EU. The Prime Minister faces mounting criticism from Labour MPs over his handling of the Lord Mandelson and Angela Rayner scandals, as well as his loyalty to Chancellor Rachel Reeves amid questions about her authority ahead of the Budget. Cabinet ministers are reportedly preparing to push Starmer out, with supporters of Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Health Secretary Wes Streeting said to be 'on manoeuvres' in anticipation of a leadership contest. One ally stated Starmer views any challenge as 'fantasy politics' and believes that leadership candidates would immediately attack Trump, demand the abandonment of fiscal rules, or call for rejoining the EU\u2014actions that could trigger negative market reactions.

A uniform national swing calculation suggests that if a general election were held today, Reform UK would have a one-in-five chance of securing a parliamentary majority. If Reform UK allied with the Conservatives, their combined chances of achieving a majority would rise to four-in-five. In contrast, the combined centre-left parties have only a one-in-30 chance of winning. The decline is most pronounced among younger voters: Labour's support among those under 35 has dropped from nearly half in the 2024 election to around one-quarter today, as young voters are splitting rightward toward Reform UK and leftward toward the Greens. Reform UK is now the most popular party among those aged 45 to 64 and has also gained dominance among the Conservative Party\u2019s most reliable base: pensioners.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[Donald J.

Despite Labour's 2024 election promise of economic growth that would allow investment in infrastructure, housing, healthcare, and wages without raising taxes, the government has failed to deliver on this pledge. Sixteen months after taking power, economic indicators show no significant improvement: public debt has reached \u20ac3 trillion (100% of GDP), with \u20ac11 billion in monthly interest payments. The government admits the economy has not responded as expected, forcing a tax hike to avoid bankruptcy. Starmer previously vowed not to raise taxes, especially on income, social security, and VAT, and even pledged to protect fiscal reserves. However, he broke this promise by increasing employer social security contributions, which reduced employment. The government now blames the UK\u2019s financial crisis on Brexit, claiming it cost 4% of GDP and \u20ac80 billion annually, though it avoids calling Brexit a mistake. It also attributes economic strain to Trump\u2019s tariffs, Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the pandemic, and the 2008 financial crisis. Despite these external factors, public trust has eroded: Labour\u2019s support has dropped to 15%, tied with the Conservatives, behind Reform UK, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens.

Farage criticized both the European Union and UK governments for imposing excessive regulation, stating that '50 years of endless red tape' from Brussels and the expansion of regulatory power under Tony Blair have made life 'a misery' for small businesses. He emphasized that small businesses\u2014comprising 99% of UK firms and half the economy\u2014have been neglected, with regulators seen as adversarial rather than supportive. Farage highlighted that big businesses dominate political discourse, while small entrepreneurs lack a voice. He pledged to abolish IR35 rules, raise the VAT threshold, and create a policy board to shape Reform\u2019s small business agenda ahead of the next election. Kevin Byrne, founder of Checkatrade, joined Reform UK, citing 'desperation and disappointment' with successive governments, and declared that 'when Britain's small businesses thrive, Britain will thrive.' Labour responded by calling Reform\u2019s policies a 'disaster' for small businesses, accusing Farage of undermining trade deals and clean energy jobs. Polling data showed Farage is more trusted on the economy than Keir Starmer or Rachel Reeves, with a net trust score of -19, compared to Starmer\u2019s -41 and Reeves\u2019s -48. The event was supported by a \u00a3200,000 donation from Lord Bamford, a Conservative ally, who said both Reform and the Conservatives recognize small businesses as the 'backbone of our economy.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News UK](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/eu-makes-life-misery-businesses-124549399.html)\n\n**More than half of voters want Starmer and Reeves to resign - London Business News | Londonlovesbusiness.com**\nA November 2025 Opinium poll reveals that a majority of UK voters\u201456%\u2014believe Prime Minister Keir Starmer should resign, compared to 26% who want him to stay, with 19% undecided.

This rise follows a sharp increase in membership, surpassing that of both Labour and the Conservatives, and a jump from 6.4% support at the last general election to the late teens in current polls. The party now has four MPs and around 800 councillors, and could win up to 42 seats in the Commons if a general election were held today. Factors behind the surge include Labour's unpopularity under Keir Starmer, the Liberal Democrats' positioning as a centre-left alternative, and the lack of a fully established left-wing challenger like the 'Your Party' grouping. Polanski, known for his media presence, charisma, and social media savvy, has shifted the party's focus from traditional environmental issues to broader social justice and inequality, resonating with disillusioned Labour voters. He has also avoided entanglement in the Corbyn-Sultana political drama. While the Greens are seen as offering 'strong meat' to disaffected voters\u2014similar to Reform Party\u2019s appeal\u2014critics note a lack of detailed policy backing for their radical proposals. Under the current multi-party system, the first-past-the-post voting structure may still force Green voters to choose Labour, but Polanski, though not yet an MP (he serves on the London Assembly), could emerge as a major political figure in the coming years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 10:48 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/politics-explained/zack-polanski-green-party-opinion-poll-votes-b2854041.html)\n\n**From Electoral Triumph to Historic Unpopularity: Keir Starmer's Rapid Decline in British Politics**\nKeir Starmer has set a British record for the fastest decline in public approval among newly elected prime ministers. After leading the Labour Party to a decisive victory in the 2024 general election\u2014ending 14 years of Conservative rule with a 19.9 percentage point swing\u2014the government has seen a dramatic drop in popularity. A recent Ipsos survey shows only 22% of Britons would vote for Labour if an election were held today, and 80% are dissatisfied with Starmer\u2019s leadership. This rapid decline is unprecedented in modern British political history. While Labour\u2019s own voters increasingly believe the government is making poor decisions, the party has not regained support from former Conservative voters. Instead, voters have shifted toward Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform UK, which has surged in popularity, particularly on immigration policy. Farage, a key figure in Brexit, is now projected to become prime minister in a hypothetical election, marking the first time in over a century that a non-Labour or non-Conservative leader would hold the office. Starmer has criticized Farage\u2019s populism, calling it a 'battle for the soul of the nation,' but public concern remains low. Internal dissent also exists within Labour, as Manchester\u2019s mayor Andy Burnham has launched an alternative political platform advocating for tax reform, more public housing, and electoral system changes. A YouGov poll indicates that Labour voters prefer Burnham over Starmer. Despite criticism from the left for being too cautious on redistribution, Starmer has maintained the Conservative-era income tax levels and implemented austerity measures on social programs due to economic constraints. Meanwhile, defence spending is expected to rise significantly. Starmer previously stated it would take a decade to rebuild the country, and he has until at least 2029 for the next general election.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 04:21 PM\nSource:[Aftenposten Interaktiv](https://www.aftenposten.no/verden/i/4Bya5e/fra-valgskred-til-historisk-upopulaer-paa-15-maaneder-britene-har-vendt-seg-mot-sin-leder-paa-rekordtid)\n\n**How did Keir Starmer go from a landslide win to Britain's most unpopular PM in a year?**\nKeir Starmer, who led the Labour Party to a historic landslide victory in July 2024 with 411 seats and a 174-seat majority, has become the most unpopular British prime minister in modern polling history within just 15 months. Polls show only 13% of voters are satisfied with his leadership, with 79% dissatisfied\u2014surpassing even Liz Truss\u2019s record-low approval during her 44-day tenure. Despite Labour\u2019s electoral dominance, the victory was built on only about one-third of the national vote and low voter turnout, resulting in a 'loveless' landslide, according to polling expert John Curtice. Starmer\u2019s government faces a fragile economic backdrop: high inflation, stagnant wages, and a fiscal gap left by prior Conservative tax cuts. With a pledge not to raise taxes on 'working people,' Labour resorted to unpopular revenue measures, undermining public confidence. Starmer\u2019s lack of ideological identity\u2014described as pragmatic and rule-bound, with no favorite novel or political hero\u2014has left voters unclear on what he stands for, fueling political mystery and weakening party cohesion. The rise of Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has surged to 30\u201335% support, overtaking Labour\u2019s 20\u201323%, while a left-wing breakaway, 'Your Party,' led by Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, could attract up to one in five 2024 Labour voters. Internal turmoil includes the resignation of deputy leader Angela Rayner over tax underpayment, a cabinet reshuffle, and speculation around potential challengers like Manchester mayor Andy Burnham. Labour\u2019s support has dropped from 37.5% in July 2024 to 23.3% by June 2025\u2014a decline of over 14 points, the steepest in recent history. Despite policy moves such as suspending family reunion for asylum seekers and announcing Palestinian statehood recognition, Labour\u2019s approval remains low, with net favourability at -47%, worse than most international peers except French President Emmanuel Macron (-55%). The next general election is scheduled for 2029, but Starmer\u2019s ability to lead Labour to victory is now in serious doubt.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 10:23 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/keir-starmer-uk-most-unpopular-prime-minister-record-13938452.html)\n\n**Keir Starmer is polling as the UK&#x2019;s most unpopular prime minister on record. Where did it all go wrong?**\nKeir Starmer, the UK's Prime Minister since July 2024, has become the most unpopular prime minister in British history, according to Ipsos polling data. Just 13% of voters express satisfaction with Starmer, while 79% are dissatisfied. This marks the worst-ever decline in support for a newly elected government, as noted by political analyst John Curtice. Despite Labour's landslide victory in the 2024 general election\u2014winning a parliamentary majority with only about one-third of the national vote\u2014low voter turnout meant that only about one in five Britons actually voted for Starmer. Since taking office, Labour's support has plummeted to around 20% in recent polls, while Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has surged to approximately 35%, matching Labour\u2019s 2024 share. This shift has sparked fears within Labour that Reform UK could secure a majority in the next election, due in 2029. These concerns were palpable at Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool, where party members and MPs grappled with declining public patience and waning confidence in Starmer\u2019s leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 07:15 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

Where did it all go wrong?**\nKeir Starmer, the UK's Prime Minister since July 2024, has become the most unpopular prime minister in British history, according to Ipsos polling data, with only 13% of voters satisfied and 79% dissatisfied. This marks the worst-ever decline in support for a newly elected government in the UK. Despite Labour's landslide victory in the 2024 general election\u2014winning two-thirds of parliamentary seats with just one-third of the vote\u2014support has plummeted to around 20% in recent polls, while Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has surged to 35%, matching Labour\u2019s previous share. Analysts like John Curtice attribute the collapse to Labour\u2019s lack of a clear ideological identity, dubbed 'Starmerism,' leaving voters uncertain about his vision. Labour\u2019s economic strategy has been hampered by its pre-election pledge to avoid income tax increases, forcing reliance on unpopular revenue measures. Policies such as ending universal winter fuel subsidies and cutting benefits for disabled people\u2014later reversed after backlash\u2014damaged credibility and raised borrowing costs. The immigration debate has intensified, with violent protests and a London anti-immigration march attended by Elon Musk, who urged resistance. Starmer has adopted a tough stance on illegal immigration, warning of Britain becoming 'an island of strangers,' but critics accuse him of mimicking Farage\u2019s rhetoric. In response, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned Reform UK\u2019s push to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR) as 'racist,' though Labour\u2019s own plan to extend ILR eligibility from five to ten years has drawn criticism. Labour\u2019s long-term agenda\u2014building 1.5 million homes, reforming taxation, and rebuilding public services\u2014faces skepticism, especially as voters increasingly favor immediate change over gradual renewal. Despite international progress, including restored EU relations and a 'one-in-one-out' migrant return deal, domestic frustration persists. Starmer\u2019s conference speech framed the nation\u2019s future as a choice between 'decency' and 'division,' but many question whether the public will endure a decade of austerity for a 'fairer country.' As Hermer, the attorney general, stated, 'the British public will be able to smell a fraud'\u2014a warning that Labour\u2019s long-term renewal strategy may not be enough to counter the appeal of Reform UK\u2019s more immediate, combative politics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 05:21 PM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https://kesq.com/news/national-world/cnn-world/2025/09/30/keir-starmer-is-polling-as-the-uks-most-unpopular-prime-minister-on-record-where-did-it-all-go-wrong/)\n\n**Starmer hits record low in UK opinion poll  --  RT World News**\nAn Ipsos poll of 1,157 British adults released Sunday found that only 13% of Britons are satisfied with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, while 79% are dissatisfied \u2013 a record low for any UK prime minister polled by Ipsos since 1977.

To form a majority government, a party must win at least 326 seats. The election concluded with the Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, projected to secure a decisive victory, potentially ending 14 years of Conservative rule under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. According to pre-election polling, Labour was leading with strong support, while the Conservatives faced historic low approval ratings and a fragmented voter base, particularly in key constituencies. The Liberal Democrats, Greens, Reform UK, SNP, Plaid Cymru, and DUP also contested the election. The House of Lords, an appointed upper chamber, does not play a role in the electoral process. The UK operates as a constitutional monarchy, with King Charles III serving as the ceremonial head of state; real political power rests with Parliament. The prime minister, who leads the executive branch and appoints the Cabinet, serves a five-year term. Key issues in the election included the economy (52% of voters), healthcare (50%), immigration and asylum (40%), housing (24%), and the environment (20%), according to a YouGov survey conducted on June 24, 2024. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland hold partial legislative authority. The current parliamentary breakdown prior to the election was: Conservatives \u2013 344 seats (52.9%), Labour \u2013 205 seats (31.5%), SNP \u2013 43 seats (6.6%), Liberal Democrats \u2013 15 seats (2.3%), and 43 seats held by nine other parties and independents.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 04, 2024 09:44 AM\nSource:[india.com](https://www.india.com/news/world/uk-general-elections-2024-heres-how-president-is-elected-election-process-parties-and-key-contenders-7059030/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters broadly agree that the likelihood of Labour polling fourth place or worse in the UK on Politico's average before January 1, 2026, is very high\u2014an outcome virtually unprecedented in modern British political history. All experts highlight Labour's historic polling collapse, with multiple reputable polls (YouGov, Opinium, Ipsos, Find Out Now) recently showing Labour at 15\u201320%, often in fourth place behind Reform UK, the Conservatives, and the Greens. They attribute this to a convergence of negative factors: Starmer\u2019s record-low approval, widespread public disillusionment, broken fiscal promises (notably over tax policy), a looming leadership crisis with active speculation about Starmer's possible ouster, and voter realignment both left (Greens) and right (Reform UK). Several experts note that this collapse is reinforced by negative media narratives and the anticipated fallout from the late November budget.\n\nWhile all recognize the UK\u2019s two-party system and the historical 'stickiness' of major party support, most forecasters judge that these base rates are being overwhelmed by the current multi-poll, multi-party momentum, and by the volatility of public opinion in the absence of an imminent general election (dampening tactical voting and party loyalty effects). The main caveat against an extreme probability is the smoothing inherent in Politico\u2019s polling average, which could lag brief polling dips or be blunted by a sudden minor Labour rebound or by rivals stalling. Nevertheless, the resolution criteria require only a single occurrence of Labour falling to fourth in the average during a short (7-week) window.\n\nProbability estimates range from 65% (tempered by polling average inertia and base rates) to as high as 95% (pointing to the depth, breadth, and consistency of Labour\u2019s polling woes and the near certainty of Politico\u2019s average registering this historic nadir at least once). The bulk of forecasts fall in the 75\u201390% range. In sum, the expert consensus is that, barring an abrupt and unlikely polling reversal, Labour will almost certainly be recorded in fourth place or lower on Politico before January 1, 2026, due to an extraordinary, multifactorial political crisis and realignment in UK politics.",
