The resolution criteria require a clear, top-level White House commitment with specific branding and at least $2B in federal funds for AGI acceleration. With less than two months before resolution, the probability of such a formal, branded announcement materializing is low, especially given the typical federal process and the tendency for large, new initiatives to be announced early in a presidential term or in response to a crisis. The base rate for new 'moonshot' initiatives of this type within a short window is low, and current signals indicate continued incrementalism or public-private partnership framing.

From the perspective of OSTP and White House procedures, even if the streams are aligned, the absence of preparatory signals, bureaucratic groundwork, and interagency coordination makes it extremely difficult to launch a formal, branded White House AGI moonshot with a $2B+ explicit federal commitment in such a short window. The base rate for sudden, high-velocity federal science initiatives of this scale is extremely low. While the administration is rhetorically bold, it has consistently favored leveraging private capital over direct federal outlays for AGI, and the resolution criteria demand a specific kind of announcement that has not yet materialized. Thus, while the political window is open, procedural barriers are decisive, and the probability should remain much closer to the single digits."

This perspective mirrors the budget and appropriations reality, where true moonshot initiatives require clear, direct federal funding commitments and a formalized, public process\u2014both of which are absent in the current landscape.

The lack of preparatory signals, leaks, or signs of a large bureaucratic mobilization further argues against a sudden, major punctuation. True punctuations at this scale\u2014especially those requiring interagency coordination, explicit federal funding, and formal White House branding\u2014almost always leave clearer traces ahead of their announcement.

Kingdon's Multiple Streams framework explicitly allows for policy windows to be exploited by powerful actors, and the Trump administration has demonstrated the capacity to surprise with major announcements that bypass some ordinary procedures. While bureaucratic inertia is real, the alignment of political, problem, and policy streams, plus the administration's demonstrated willingness to announce major public-private ventures, means the probability should not be pushed to the extreme low single digits.

The forecaster is correct to note that, despite record-breaking investment numbers and aggressive administration rhetoric, nearly all major initiatives so far have been structured as public-private partnerships or focused on enabling infrastructure, not direct, top-level government AGI acceleration.

Their argument that the most likely scenario is continued leveraging of private capital, public-private partnerships, and regulatory facilitation, rather than a sudden, explicit federal $2B+ moonshot, is solid. They also correctly note that the historical base rate for such government-led AGI initiatives is extremely low, especially with less than two months left and no policy leaks or signals. Their moderately low probability reflects a realistic appraisal of the innovation system's structure, which is dominated by private actors and market mechanisms, with government playing an enabling rather than a direct funding role.

Their prediction appropriately balances the exceptional pace and geopolitical urgency with the inertia of established policy routines. By assigning a probability that is notable yet restrained, they avoid both the base rate fallacy and unwarranted optimism. Their scenario analysis and attention to the public-private dynamic reflect a realistic understanding of how public goods like AGI tend to be coordinated in the US\u2014through catalysis and infrastructure, not direct government R&D moonshots.

They appropriately highlight that the bulk of current U.S. AI activity, despite its magnitude, is structured around public-private partnership and infrastructure, not direct federal AGI acceleration. This careful attention to both the scale of investment and the formal structure and branding of federal initiatives is essential from a cost-benefit perspective: large, direct federal R&D investments are typically justified only when private incentives are insufficient and the externalities are massive and clear\u2014which, in the case of AGI, are still debated and politicized.

The Kingdon model's suggestion of a higher probability due to stream alignment is persuasive in recognizing political incentives, but as both my initial analysis and other forecasters note, the lack of preparatory groundwork and signals makes a sudden qualifying announcement highly improbable.

In research, AI advanced scientific innovation: a U.S. team developed CellTransformer, an AI model published in Nature Communications on October 7, enabling the most detailed mapping of the mouse brain to date. AI now participates in research from hypothesis generation to paper writing, though most journals still prohibit AI from being listed as an author. To test AI-generated research rigor, Stanford University hosted the first fully AI-written and AI-reviewed academic conference, the 'Artificial Intelligence Science Agent Open Conference,' on October 22, operating with minimal human oversight. In industry, competition intensified: OpenAI launched ChatGPT Atlas, a browser centered on ChatGPT, on October 21, positioning it as a direct challenge to Google Chrome. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called it a 'once-in-a-decade' opportunity to reshape web browsing. On October 28, Microsoft and OpenAI announced a new final agreement to solidify their partnership, with Microsoft supporting OpenAI\u2019s board in forming a public benefit corporation (PBC) and completing capital restructuring. AI applications expanded into critical infrastructure: Italy\u2019s Ministry of Culture announced a project to develop an AI-powered security system to detect abnormal behavior near valuable artifacts, following a museum heist at the Louvre the previous day. Strategic and ecosystem development accelerated globally: the 45th Gulf Information Technology Exhibition in the Middle East showcased AI, IoT, and big data advancements, while Japan\u2019s 2025 High-Tech Expo projected AI integration into daily life. Infrastructure investment surged\u2014Morgan Stanley estimated U.S. tech giants (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft) spent up to $400 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025. Major deals included: OpenAI and Broadcom\u2019s joint development of a 10-gigawatt AI accelerator on October 13; a $40 billion consortium led by BlackRock acquiring Airend Data Centers from Macquarie on October 15; Meta\u2019s plan to build a 1-gigawatt AI data center in Texas by 2028; and Google\u2019s plan to restart a nuclear power plant in Iowa to power its AI infrastructure on October 27. Policy-wise, the European Commission released two AI strategies\u2014'Applying AI' and 'AI in Science'\u2014in early October to accelerate AI adoption in European industry and science. China issued the 'Guidance on Deployment of Large AI Models in Government Affairs' to provide direction for AI model implementation in public administration. Despite rapid adoption, risks emerged: China\u2019s China Internet Network Information Center reported 515 million users of generative AI by June 2025, indicating deep integration into daily life. However, the European Broadcasting Union found on October 22 that about half of AI assistants\u2019 responses to news queries were inaccurate. On October 24, a study on arXiv tested 11 large language models and found AI exhibited 'flattery' 50% more than humans, potentially compromising accuracy. In response, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law on October 13 requiring AI chatbot operators to implement 'critical' safeguards, such as preventing interactions on suicide or self-harm with minors or vulnerable groups. On October 16, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned that while AI boosts productivity, it could also widen inequality within and between nations, urging stronger policy responses.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1893892941_70e2834d02001v0gm.html?from=society)\n\n**AI Weekly Roundup**\nThe AI economy reached a new milestone in November 2025, marked by Nvidia becoming the world's first company to achieve a $5 trillion market capitalization, reflecting strong investor confidence in its central role in AI infrastructure.

The timeline includes: September 2026 for an 'intern-level AI research assistant' capable of helping build the next AI, and March 2028 for a 'legitimate AI researcher'\u2014an AI capable of conducting independent, high-level research. This milestone signifies the potential start of recursive self-improvement, triggering an 'intelligence explosion' where AI accelerates its own development. The announcement, backed by OpenAI\u2019s $1.4 trillion infrastructure plans, is presented not as a prediction but as a target. The article notes that missing this date carries significant strategic risk, with even major investors like Mark Zuckerberg reportedly willing to misallocate hundreds of billions to avoid falling behind.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 05:23 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/write-your-world/sam-altman-just-dropped-an-exact-date-for-agi-2619490b435c)\n\n**\"Manhattan II\"  --  Former CIA Officer Buck Sexton Exposes the Hidden Race With China**\nFormer CIA officer Buck Sexton warns of a critical global race for Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), which he labels 'Manhattan II,' in a press release published on October 31, 2025. According to Sexton, the United States is now engaged in a high-stakes technological arms race with China, comparable in scale to the original Manhattan Project. He asserts that whoever achieves ASI first will gain permanent global dominance in military, economic, and geopolitical power. Sexton criticizes former President Biden for issuing Executive Order 14110, which he claims stifled AI innovation by imposing excessive regulations on top scientists. In contrast, he praises President Trump for immediately repealing the order on his first day back in office and launching a new, aggressive initiative. The 'Manhattan II' project is estimated to involve $2.2 trillion in funding, distributed as follows: $500 billion for AI infrastructure and data networks, $280 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, $175 billion for an AI-powered defense shield, and $1.4 trillion for advanced energy systems. Sexton claims China is already operating at wartime production speed, capable of manufacturing 500,000 AI-powered drones per month, with over a million already deployed. He warns that China is leveraging American technology to threaten U.S. national security. Sexton frames the race as America\u2019s 'last chance' to reclaim global leadership and secure its future. He positions 'Manhattan II' as a pivotal moment for America\u2019s economic and military revival through innovation. Buck Sexton, a former CIA counter-terrorism officer who debriefed President George W. Bush during the Iraq War and was hand-picked to co-host a top-rated radio program with over 15 million followers, uses his national security background to advocate for urgent action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 02:02 PM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/10/31/3178399/0/en/Manhattan-II-Former-CIA-Officer-Buck-Sexton-Exposes-the-Hidden-Race-With-China.html)\n\n**U.S. Developments: Trump\u2019s Refugee Plan Sparks Debate, OpenAI Launches Aardvark, China Agrees to Major U.S. Agricultural Purchases**\nOn Thursday, October 31, 2025, the United States witnessed a wave of political, economic, and technological developments. The Trump administration announced a controversial refugee policy limiting admissions to 7,500 for the 2026 fiscal year\u2014the lowest in modern history\u2014prioritizing white South Africans under Executive Order 14204, citing humanitarian and national interests and targeting individuals 'exposed to unlawful or unjust discrimination' in their home countries. The move has drawn scrutiny for explicitly favoring a demographic group not previously prioritized in refugee policies, reflecting broader efforts to tighten immigration control under a 'merit-based humanitarian' framework. In technology, OpenAI launched Aardvark, an autonomous AI-powered cybersecurity researcher driven by GPT-5, designed to detect and patch software vulnerabilities. Described as a 'breakthrough in AI and security research,' Aardvark is currently in private beta to refine its real-world capabilities before wider rollout. Industry experts view it as a pivotal step in integrating AI and cybersecurity, a trend central to corporate tech strategy. In trade, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins confirmed that China will purchase 12 million tons of U.S. soybeans in 2025 following a meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping, with additional commitments to buy 25 million tons annually from 2026 to 2028, plus sorghum and hardwood. Rollins hailed the deal as 'HUGE,' stating it would channel funds 'directly to American farms, American workers, and American families,' aiding recovery after years of trade volatility. In financial markets, Meta Platforms Inc. shares dropped over 11%, reaching their lowest level in four months, after reporting a sharp 83% year-over-year decline in earnings per share to $1.05\u2014well below analyst expectations\u2014sparking investor concern over rising AI-related costs. The broader markets followed, with the S&P 500 falling nearly 1%, the Nasdaq Composite dropping 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declining 0.2%. While Alphabet shares rose 3% on strong results, declines in Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia triggered a broad rotation out of tech stocks. Conversely, bank and healthcare stocks\u2014including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Eli Lilly\u2014rose on strong earnings and favorable outlooks.\nOriginal language: da-DK\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[Invezz - Danish](https://invezz.com/da/nyheder/2025/10/30/amerikansk-sammenfatning-trumps-flygtningeloft-udloser-debat-openai-afslorer-aardvark-kina-handelsaftale/)\n\n**Global AI Landscape in October 2025: Breakthroughs, Strategic Expansion, and Emerging Risks**\nIn October 2025, global artificial intelligence (AI) development continued to show multi-point breakthroughs and cross-disciplinary integration, driving paradigm shifts across multiple fields while raising growing concerns about challenges and risks.

Following a May 2024 visit by U.S. President Donald Trump, the U.A.E. announced plans for a $500 billion Stargate AI complex and promised $1.4 trillion in U.S. investments. The U.S. Commerce Department recently approved the export of 500,000 advanced Nvidia microchips to the U.A.E., lifting prior national security restrictions. OpenAI praised the region's 'democratic values, open markets, and trusted partnerships,' while Blackstone signed a $3 billion deal with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Humain to build data centers. The U.A.E. has demonstrated AI capability with the release of K2 Think, a budget-friendly alternative to ChatGPT, and has led the region in AI governance since appointing the world\u2019s first AI minister in 2017. Geopolitical conditions favor cooperation: the Trump administration\u2019s push to dominate the 'AI stack' reduces fears of chip leakage to China, and regional instability\u2014such as Iran\u2019s diminished capacity after Israeli-U.S. strikes\u2014creates a favorable backdrop. The Gulf\u2019s central location, within a 2,000-mile radius of half the world\u2019s population, makes it strategically positioned to serve energy-constrained markets like India. However, progress has lagged: the approved Nvidia chips will only be used by U.S. firms like Oracle operating in the U.A.E., not directly sold to Emirati or Saudi entities. Analysts warn of a significant profit gap, as standalone data centers may not generate sufficient returns without control over upstream software and services, which remain likely to be dominated by Silicon Valley. Security risks persist, with concerns over the vulnerability of high-value infrastructure to conflict or attack, a risk unfamiliar to major tech investors. According to Robert Mogielnicki of the Arab Gulf States Institute, the ambitious bilateral deals have not advanced as quickly as expected. Simon Henderson of the Washington Institute calls the chip approval a 'test case' for future cooperation. Matt Gertken of BCA Research predicts that while the region has strong comparative advantages, the economic viability of these projects remains uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 01:41 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/global/what-oil-monarchies-can-bring-to-the-ai-table-11761874109207.html)\n\n**AI Giants Turn Eyes to South Korea Amid Global Tech Race and Strategic Investments**\nMajor AI companies, including OpenAI, Amazon, and NVIDIA, are intensifying their focus on South Korea amid significant technological and investment developments. On October 1, OpenAI announced a partnership with Samsung and SK Hynix to support the $500 billion 'Stargate' initiative\u2014co-led by OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle\u2014aimed at expanding AI infrastructure globally, with a 'Korean version' of the project. SK Hynix reported record quarterly profits, with operating income up 119% year-on-year and exceeding 10 trillion KRW for the first time, driven by strong demand for AI-grade memory chips, and confirmed its 2026 chip capacity is fully booked. The collaboration includes telecom infrastructure, data center expansion, and floating data centers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, praising Korea as having 'all the conditions to become a global AI leader' and noting it has the highest number of ChatGPT paid subscribers outside the U.S. On October 29, the South Korean presidential office revealed Amazon plans to invest at least $5 billion in South Korea by 2031 to build AI data centers. President Lee reiterated Korea\u2019s goal to become one of the world\u2019s top three AI leaders and to position Seoul as Asia\u2019s AI hub. The 2025 APEC summit in Korea drew global attention: U.S. President Trump and President Lee reached a preliminary trade deal, with tariffs reduced to 15% and Korea committing to invest at least $35 billion in the U.S. The 'Technology Prosperity Agreement' includes joint AI policy frameworks, AI export coordination, secure pharmaceutical and biotech supply chains, and space exploration cooperation. On October 30, U.S. and Chinese leaders met in Busan, focusing on export controls for critical technologies like rare earths and semiconductors. NVIDIA, impacted by U.S. export restrictions, has seen its Chinese market share drop to zero since Q2 2025, despite previously holding 95% of China\u2019s AI chip market. CEO Jensen Huang emphasized at the GTC Washington event on October 28 that the U.S. must lead the AI race to ensure innovation and governance remain rooted in American technology and values, calling AI the 'Apollo moment' of this generation. He also urged the U.S. to allow AI chip exports to China to retain developer engagement, warning that bans risk losing markets and self-harm. According to Bloomberg, Huang plans to announce new partnerships with Samsung, SK Hynix, and Hyundai during the APEC CEO Summit on October 31, including supplying GPUs for South Korea\u2019s planned AI data centers. South Korea aims to spend $3 billion by 2030 to purchase approximately 200,000 high-performance GPUs. As a result, Korea has become the central focus of global AI investment and technological competition in late October 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 04:50 AM\nSource:[tmtpost.com](https://www.tmtpost.com/7743467.html)\n\n**Altman unveils trillion-dollar AI vision as OpenAI eyes massive expansion**\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled a trillion-dollar vision for AI infrastructure, outlining plans to develop 30 gigawatts of computing capacity at a projected cost of $1.4 trillion. This marks a pivotal shift from OpenAI\u2019s origins as a research-focused nonprofit to a corporate entity structured for massive public capital raising, potentially culminating in an initial public offering (IPO). Altman emphasized the need for OpenAI to scale rapidly, aiming to add 1 gigawatt of compute capacity per week\u2014equivalent to over $40 billion in capital costs per gigawatt. He also announced the expansion of the Stargate project, initially a $500 billion initiative with Oracle, SoftBank, Nvidia, and CoreWeave, now tripled to 30 GW of data center capacity. To support this, Altman stated OpenAI must eventually generate hundreds of billions in annual revenue, requiring growth at 10 times its current pace. The newly formed OpenAI Foundation will oversee mission-driven efforts, including AI for disease cures and 'AI resilience,' though funding sources remain unclear. Despite criticism over circular deals with public companies like Nvidia and concerns about an AI bubble, Altman remains focused on scaling. He earns only $76,000 annually from OpenAI, with wealth derived from tech investments. Former employees have backed Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit accusing Altman of abandoning OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit mission. Altman was briefly ousted in 2023 but reinstated days later; his tumultuous leadership is set to be dramatized in the upcoming film 'Artificial,' starring Andrew Garfield as Altman.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:56 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/altman-unveils-trillion-dollar-ai-vision-as-openai-eyes-massive-expansion-125102901701_1.html)\n\n**Trillion-dollar vision for AI age**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has unveiled an ambitious vision to build 30 gigawatts of computing infrastructure worth $1.4 trillion, aiming to scale OpenAI to a trillion-dollar enterprise. This plan, enabled by a new financial agreement with Microsoft, includes the goal of adding one gigawatt of computing power weekly. The initiative is part of the Stargate project \u2014 a $500 billion venture involving Oracle, Nvidia, SoftBank, and CoreWeave \u2014 announced at the White House in January and described by Altman as a job creator that would 'rebuild America's digital backbone.' Despite industry optimism, the plan raises concerns about financing, control, and global power imbalances. OpenAI\u2019s revenue is projected to reach $20 billion by 2025, but Altman\u2019s target requires a tenfold increase. The company\u2019s restructuring now allows freer fundraising, with an initial public offering deemed 'the most likely path.' Altman\u2019s rise mirrors Silicon Valley\u2019s top tech leaders, but his focus on AI infrastructure marks a shift from consumer products to foundational intelligence systems. Critics, including Elon Musk, accuse OpenAI of abandoning its original nonprofit mission for profit, citing governance issues and ethical risks. Altman\u2019s brief ousting in 2023 and subsequent reinstatement \u2014 now being dramatized in the film 'Artificial' starring Andrew Garfield \u2014 highlight the cultural weight of the AI era. The geopolitical stakes are high, as AI reshapes national security, finance, and democracy. Prediction markets integrated with AI, such as those on Trump Media\u2019s Truth Social, signal the fusion of AI, finance, and social media, raising ethical concerns over manipulation, data privacy, and behavioral commodification. The trillion-dollar vision is thus not just about innovation, but about control over the future of intelligence and global power structures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:32 PM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2574877/trillion-dollar-vision-for-ai-age)\n\n**Sam Altman touts trillion-dollar AI vision as OpenAI restructures to chase scale**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has unveiled an ambitious vision for the company to become a trillion-dollar AI infrastructure powerhouse, aiming to develop 30 gigawatts of computing resources at a projected cost of $1.4 trillion and add 1 gigawatt of compute capacity weekly\u2014equivalent to over $40 billion per gigawatt currently. This marks a pivotal shift from OpenAI\u2019s original nonprofit research lab model to a corporate entity structured for massive public capital raising, with an initial public offering (IPO) as the most likely path. Altman announced a restructured OpenAI Foundation to focus on AI-driven solutions for disease cures and 'AI resilience,' though funding remains unclear. The company\u2019s Stargate project, now expanded to 30 GW of data center capacity with partners including Oracle, SoftBank, Nvidia, and CoreWeave, was initially announced in January 2025 with President Donald Trump, who Altman had previously criticized. Despite lofty goals, critics question the feasibility of scaling to hundreds of billions in annual revenue\u2014requiring 10x growth from a projected $20 billion run rate\u2014due to lack of transparency in financing, controversial deals with public firms like Nvidia, and concerns over an AI bubble. Altman, who earns $76,000 annually and holds no equity in OpenAI, has faced internal strife, including being ousted by the board in 2023 before a swift reinstatement, and ongoing legal conflict with co-founder Elon Musk, who alleges OpenAI abandoned its nonprofit mission. Former employees have supported Musk\u2019s lawsuit, citing profit-driven risks. Altman\u2019s journey, including his early rise at Y Combinator and a future Hollywood film 'Artificial' starring Andrew Garfield as him, underscores his outsized influence in tech. The article was published on October 29, 2025, by the Economic Times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:02 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-touts-trillion-dollar-ai-vision-as-openai-restructures-to-chase-scale/articleshow/124910944.cms)\n\n**'Will Spend $1.4 Trillion': Sam Altman As OpenAI Restructures To Chase Scale**\nSam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has announced ambitious plans to scale the company's AI infrastructure, stating that OpenAI aims to invest $1.4 trillion to develop 30 gigawatts of computing resources. This follows a recent deal with Microsoft that lifts financial constraints on fundraising. Altman emphasized the need for OpenAI to add 1 gigawatt of compute capacity per week, a goal that would require massive capital investment\u2014currently exceeding $40 billion per gigawatt\u2014though he suggested costs could halve over time without detailing how. The initiative builds on Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure project launched in January 2025 with Oracle, SoftBank, Nvidia, and CoreWeave, which initially targeted 10 GW of data center capacity but has since tripled to 30 GW. Altman stated that OpenAI would need to generate hundreds of billions in annual revenue to sustain this scale, requiring growth 10 times faster than its current pace. OpenAI, now valued at $500 billion and transitioning from a nonprofit to a for-profit entity, is reportedly preparing for an initial public offering (IPO), according to Altman. Despite his vision, Altman faces criticism over opaque financing strategies, including circular deals with public companies like Nvidia, which some analysts warn could inflate growth expectations and fuel an AI bubble. Former employees have backed Elon Musk\u2019s lawsuit against OpenAI, accusing Altman of prioritizing profits over public safety. Musk, a co-founder who left in 2018, has criticized Stargate for lacking funding. Altman was briefly ousted from OpenAI in 2023 but was reinstated days later. His leadership and controversial trajectory will be dramatized in the upcoming Hollywood film 'Artificial,' starring Andrew Garfield as Altman, set for release in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:14 PM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/will-spend-1-4-trillion-sam-altman-as-openai-restructures-to-chase-scale-9538870)\n\n**U.S. Government Signs $80 Billion Nuclear Partnership Agreement to Support AI Development**\nThe U.S. government, under President Donald Trump, has signed an $80 billion strategic partnership to expand nuclear energy production to support the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI). The initiative, led by Brookfield Asset Management in collaboration with Westinghouse Electric Company and Cameco Corporation, aims to build 'new reactors costing at least $80 billion' across the United States to accelerate the integration of nuclear energy and AI. The project is tied to Trump\u2019s May executive order mandating the full design of 10 'new large reactors by 2030.' The federal government will fund the project, according to a Brookfield representative. This marks the largest U.S. investment in nuclear energy since Trump\u2019s return to the White House in January 2025. Tech giants like Google and Microsoft have also launched major nuclear initiatives to meet AI-driven energy demands. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated the initiative 'will help realize President Trump\u2019s grand vision of fully powering America with energy and winning the global AI race.' The project is expected to generate over 100,000 construction jobs nationwide, with each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 project supporting 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs across 43 states. The administration frames the effort as a national security priority and a catalyst for economic growth.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[NEWS.am](http://news.am/rus/news/912228.html)\n\n**Big tech firms accelerating multi-billion-dollar investments for AI partnerships**\nMajor technology firms including Nvidia, OpenAI, AMD, Oracle, Intel, CoreWeave, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Samsung, Google, and Microsoft are accelerating multi-billion-dollar investments in artificial intelligence (AI) partnerships. According to UBS, global AI spending is projected to reach $375 billion in 2025 and $500 billion by 2026. Nvidia has committed up to $100 billion in investment to OpenAI, with deployment of at least 10 gigawatts of systems starting in the second half of 2025, and will also invest $5 billion in Intel\u2019s common stock at $23.28 per share. AMD announced a partnership with OpenAI, providing custom chips for AI infrastructure, with OpenAI granted rights to purchase up to 160 million shares upon milestone achievement. CoreWeave secured contracts worth up to $22.4 billion with OpenAI and Meta, including a $6.3 billion agreement to provide Nvidia with unsold cloud capacity and a $14.2 billion commitment from Meta by 2031. Amazon has invested a total of $8 billion in Anthropic, including a $4 billion addition in November 2024. The US government acquired 433.3 million Intel shares in August 2024 at $20.47 each, gaining a 9.9% stake. SoftBank invested $2 billion in Intel in August 2024. Tesla and Samsung signed a $16.5 billion chip supply deal for the AI6 chip, to be produced at Samsung\u2019s Texas plant. Google acquired Windsurf\u2019s talent and technology in a $2.4 billion deal. Microsoft secured a $17.4 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Nebius Group, potentially rising to $19.4 billion with additional services, beginning in late 2025. President Donald Trump launched the Stargate initiative in January 2025, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, projected to invest up to $500 billion in US AI infrastructure. Meta also invested over $14 billion in Scale AI, with founder Alexandr Wang joining Meta to lead AI projects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/science-technology/big-tech-firms-accelerating-multi-billion-dollar-investments-for-ai-partnerships/3710562)\n\n**The Mega-Infrastructure Projects Fueling the AI Race**\nThe rapid development of artificial intelligence relies on massive, often invisible infrastructure. According to Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, between $3,000 and $4,000 billion will be invested in AI infrastructure by the end of the decade. Major tech companies are leading this race: Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019, eventually reaching nearly $14 billion, though OpenAI ended the exclusivity agreement in January, allowing it to diversify suppliers. Microsoft now focuses on its own models, asserting greater independence. Nvidia committed $100 billion to OpenAI in September, reinforcing its central role. Amazon invested $8 billion in Anthropic and customized hardware for AI, while Google Cloud secured partnerships with startups like Lovable and Windsurf. Oracle surprised the market in June 2025 with a $30 billion cloud services contract with OpenAI, followed by a $300 billion five-year agreement, propelling it to the forefront of AI infrastructure. Meta plans to spend $600 billion by 2028, including two major data centers: Hyperion in Louisiana (linked to a nuclear plant, $10 billion) and Prometheus in Ohio (gas-powered, scheduled for 2026). These projects raise environmental concerns, as seen with Elon Musk\u2019s xAI facility in Tennessee, which became a major local polluter. Stargate, a $500 billion project launched by Donald Trump post-election, involves SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI to build eight data centers in Texas by late 2026, despite internal tensions and questions about funding. These megaprojects reflect a broader trend: AI is not just a battle of algorithms but a war of infrastructure. Companies securing the largest computing capacities gain a lasting competitive edge. However, this race faces growing environmental, financial, and logistical constraints, signaling a future where innovation must be balanced with sustainability.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:05 PM\nSource:[fredzone.org](https://www.fredzone.org/les-megaprojets-dinfrastructure-qui-alimentent-la-course-a-lia/)\n\n**Billions Pumped into AI Infrastructure Race: Massive Deals Redefine Global Infrastructure Map**\nThe technology sector is experiencing an unprecedented surge in the race to build the infrastructure required for running large\u2011scale artificial\u2011intelligence (AI) models, with investments running into the hundreds of billions of dollars from major global firms.  According to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, AI infrastructure spending could exceed 4\u202ftrillion dollars by the end of the decade.  Key deals include Microsoft\u2019s initial $1\u202fbillion investment in OpenAI in 2019, which later grew to about $14\u202fbillion before the exclusive partnership ended this year, while Microsoft retained priority rights on certain projects.  Oracle announced a $30\u202fbillion cloud\u2011services deal with OpenAI in June, followed by a $300\u202fbillion, five\u2011year contract in September that temporarily pushed its founder Larry Ellison to the top of the list of richest men.  Meta plans to spend $600\u202fbillion on U.S. infrastructure by 2028, including a $10\u202fbillion Hypreion data\u2011center in Louisiana capable of delivering 5\u202fgigawatts of compute power and partially powered by a nuclear plant.  Former U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s StarGate project, a joint venture with SoftBank, Oracle, and OpenAI, is budgeted at $500\u202fbillion to build the world\u2019s largest AI data\u2011center network, with eight centers slated for completion in Texas by 2026.  Despite these massive investments, the race raises growing concerns about the enormous energy consumption and emissions associated with AI data centers, exemplified by criticism of Elon Musk\u2019s xAI project for environmental violations.

It notes that Washington is investing billions of dollars and burning massive energy reserves to develop AGI, citing the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric that AI will \u201ccompletely flip the global order\u201d and the U.S. congressional committee\u2019s proposal for a \u201cManhattan Project\u201d for AGI. In contrast, President Xi Jinping has directed Chinese tech firms such as DeepSeek to build tools that solve immediate problems\u2014helping farmers plant rice, improving weather forecasts, and enabling police to analyze case data. China\u2019s $8.4\u202fbillion AI fund, the nationwide \u201cAI+\u201d campaign, and the open\u2011source model strategy are highlighted as mechanisms that accelerate deployment of existing AI systems. The piece cites real\u2011world examples: DeepSeek\u2019s agricultural AI in Xiong\u2019an, the 12345 hotline that routes citizen calls, and AI\u2011assisted medical teams at Tsinghua University. It also mentions that U.S. firms like OpenAI, Meta, and Google continue to bet on AGI, with OpenAI\u2019s GPT\u20115 launch described as \u201cmessy\u201d after CEO Sam Altman\u2019s admission of a possible investment bubble. The article quotes Eric Schmidt and Selina Xu: 'In being solely fixated on this objective, our nation risks falling behind China, which is far less concerned with creating AI powerful enough to surpass humans and much more focused on using the technology we have now.' The narrative underscores that while China is not ignoring AGI, it is prioritizing immediate, exportable AI solutions, whereas the U.S. remains locked in an AGI race that may ultimately lag behind China\u2019s practical gains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 08:25 AM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chinas-ai-playbook-nothing-like-americas/)\n\n**Trump Announces $92 Billion in Investments to Boost Artificial Intelligence**\nUS President Donald Trump announced agreements worth $92 billion to develop infrastructure and energy production to meet the growing demand for artificial intelligence. Trump attended the Energy and Innovation Summit in Pennsylvania, where he emphasized the need to surpass China in the global AI race. 'Today's commitments ensure that the future will be created (...) right here in Pennsylvania and right here in Pittsburgh, and I have to say, right here in the United States,' Trump said at the event. The tech world has adopted AI generatively as a technological revolution, but concerns are growing that its enormous energy needs cannot be met by the current infrastructure, particularly in the US. AI requires high computing capacity, with Nvidia's image processors being a key factor. The company has become the world's most valuable company by market capitalization. Official estimates indicate that by 2028, technology companies will need up to 5 gigawatts of power to drive AI, enough to power approximately five million homes. Trump also launched the 'Stargate' project in January, aimed at investing up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the US, mainly in response to growing competition with China. The Japanese investment bank SoftBank, the creator of ChatGPT, OpenAI, and Oracle are investing $100 billion in the initial phase of this initiative.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 10:51 AM\nSource:[elcomercio.pe](https://elcomercio.pe/tecnologia/inteligencia-artificial/donald-trump-anuncia-megainversiones-para-impulsar-el-boom-de-la-inteligencia-artificial-china-estados-unidos-nvidia-noticia/)\n\n**Trump to Announce $70 Billion Investment in Artificial Intelligence and Energy in Pennsylvania**\nUS President Donald Trump is set to announce a $70 billion investment in artificial intelligence and energy in Pennsylvania, as part of the White House's efforts to accelerate the development of emerging technologies. The investment will come through a series of companies and will include the creation of new data centers, expansion of power generation capacity, and upgrading of the electrical grid, as well as the launch of specialized training and professional development programs in artificial intelligence. Trump will participate in the event alongside Senator David McCormick, who is hosting the inaugural edition of the Energy and Innovation Summit in Pennsylvania, at Carnegie Mellon University. The event is expected to attract leaders from the artificial intelligence and energy sectors, including up to 60 CEOs. Among the expected participants are Larry Fink from BlackRock, Alex Karp from Palantir Technologies, Dario Amodei from Anthropic, Darren Woods from Exxon Mobil, and Mike Wirth from Chevron. According to Jake Murphy, spokesperson for McCormick, John Gray, CEO of Blackstone, will announce a $25 billion project to develop energy infrastructure and data centers, and launch a joint project to increase power generation capacity, which is expected to create 6,000 jobs per year in the construction sector and 3,000 permanent jobs. Blackstone declined to comment, while Axios published details of the summit earlier. US commitment to AI superiority The announcements expected on Tuesday are the latest step taken by Trump to fulfill his pledge to ensure American leadership in artificial intelligence. Since the beginning of his second term, Trump has adopted a comprehensive strategy that includes attracting private investments, relaxing regulatory restrictions, and speeding up the issuance of necessary licenses for new projects. Earlier this year, Trump announced a $100 billion investment in artificial intelligence data centers by SoftBank Group, OpenAI, and Oracle. The Trump administration also lifted restrictions on AI chips imposed during the Biden era, as part of a broader plan to boost American innovation and facilitate access to advanced technology for US allies. These moves aim to keep the United States ahead of China in the AI race. Beijing has invested heavily in this emerging sector, and the Chinese startup DeepSeek has raised concerns among investors on Wall Street after unveiling its AI model 'R1', which showed the possibility of developing AI at very low costs. Data centers and increasing demand for electricity Trump and his administration have also emphasized the importance of meeting another priority for the technology sector: ensuring the United States has enough electricity to power AI-intensive data centers. According to their view, providing sufficient electricity is a matter of national security, essential to ensuring America's continued superiority over its global competitors in the AI race. By 2035, data centers are expected to account for 8.6% of the US electricity demand, more than double their current share of 3.5%, according to Bloomberg NEF data. In this context, the Trump administration has pointed out that expanding reliance on coal-fired power plants, as well as natural gas and nuclear power, is necessary to support this growing demand. It has also warned that failing to take these steps could lead to potential power outages in the future. The US Energy Department has used emergency powers to keep two power plants from being shut down, and hinted at the possibility of further federal intervention. The political significance of choosing Pennsylvania By hosting the event in Pennsylvania, Trump and McCormick highlight the political importance of accelerating the development of artificial intelligence. The key state is a 'battleground' in the electoral arena, where Biden won in 2020, and Trump regained in 2024. The event comes after the completion of a deal between Japanese steelmaker Nippon Steel and US Steel, headquartered in Pittsburgh, for $14.1 billion. The deal ended a contentious takeover dispute that had intersected with US politics for several months before ultimately receiving Trump's support. The deal is expected to boost local steel production and protect thousands of jobs. Both Trump and Biden had sought to win the support of labor unions, while the United Steelworkers union opposed the deal.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 08:08 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2025/07/15/article_2763956.html)\n\n**Trump to Announce $70 Billion in Investments in AI and Energy**\nUS President Donald Trump is expected to announce $70 billion in investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and energy in the state of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, July 15. This initiative is part of the White House plan to accelerate the development of technology in the country. The investments from various companies will include new data centers, expansion of energy generation, and improvements to network infrastructure, as well as AI training and internship programs. Trump will be accompanied by Republican Senator David McCormick at the first Energy and Innovation Summit in Pennsylvania at Carnegie Mellon University, where leaders in AI and energy, including 60 executives, will attend. Jon Gray, of Blackstone Inc., is expected to announce a $25 billion project for the development of data center and energy infrastructure. A joint venture will also be launched to increase energy generation, creating 6,000 construction jobs annually and 3,000 permanent jobs, according to Jake Murphy, McCormick's spokesperson. The announcements may represent a significant step by Trump in his promise to seek US leadership in AI. Since the beginning of his second term, the President has adopted a comprehensive approach that includes attracting private sector investments, relaxing regulations, and accelerating the licensing process for new projects. Trump has already announced a $100 billion investment in AI data centers from SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI Inc., and Oracle Corp. The government has also repealed restrictions on the use of AI chips, established by the Joe Biden administration, as part of a broader effort to drive innovation in the country and facilitate access to advanced technology for US allies. The measures aim to keep the US ahead of China in the AI race. Beijing has invested significantly in this emerging technology, and the Chinese startup DeepSeek shook investors on Wall Street in January with its innovative R1 model, suggesting that AI could be developed at a much lower cost. Trump and other government officials have also emphasized the importance of meeting another priority of the technology industry: ensuring that the US has enough energy to operate AI data centers, which consume a lot of energy. In their view, adequate electricity supply is linked to national security, essential for keeping the US ahead of global competitors in the race to dominate AI.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: July 14, 2025 03:19 PM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/mundo/trump-vai-anunciar-us-70-bilhoes-de-investimento-em-ia-e-energia-diz-agencia/)\n\n",

    "summary": "The forecasts converge around a low likelihood that the White House will launch a multi-billion dollar AGI 'moonshot' initiative and announce it via official press release committing at least $2 billion in direct government funds before January 1, 2026. All experts note that, despite massive public-private AI/tech infrastructure investments (e.g., Stargate, $80B nuclear), the majority of funding and announcements have thus far been private-led or joint ventures, rather than singular, White House-branded government initiatives specifically focused on AGI acceleration. Process experts stress that such 'moonshot' federal programs are rare, typically requiring months of preparation, and have not been observed so late in a political cycle. Several perspectives acknowledge that the Trump administration is rhetorically motivated by the AI race with China, and that political incentives for a dramatic gesture remain elevated. However, experts repeatedly highlight the strict resolution criteria\u2014the requirement for an official White House press release announcing a new, explicit, federally led AGI moonshot with $2B+ government funding\u2014and the lack of preparatory signals, leaks, or groundwork for such an initiative. Base rates from history and bureaucratic inertia further reduce the probability. Most assign probabilities between 7% and 32%, with a consensus in the 10%-25% range\u2014suggesting a nonzero but still unlikely chance, barring a major last-minute geopolitical or technological trigger. In summary: While the strategic climate and scale of private investment are unprecedented, it remains much more likely than not that no qualifying White House AGI moonshot announcement will occur before 2026.",
