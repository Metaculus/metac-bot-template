You highlight that, globally, less than 1,000 confirmed H5 human cases have occurred over decades, and US case counts remain in the dozens annually even amidst large outbreaks in birds and mammals. This is consistent with USDA APHIS surveillance findings: high animal infection rates do not equate to high human case numbers without a fundamental shift in transmission. Your emphasis on the lack of evidence for a mutation producing efficient human-to-human spread\u2014and the improbability of such a shift occurring and escaping detection\u2014is critical. Additionally, you are correct that CDC reporting disruptions affect data timeliness, not the absolute likelihood of a true explosion in human cases being documented. Only a low-probability, high-impact event (such as an unprecedented viral shift) could change this, and current genetic and epidemiological surveillance shows no such sign. Your probability and reasoning are robustly supported by both veterinary public health data and historical precedent."

Your argument that even a large surveillance artifact or backlog would not plausibly explain such an increase is well-founded.

This structural constraint\u2014combined with the base rate of observed zoonotic transmission and the absence of any signals of human-to-human spread\u2014makes your near-zero probability well justified.

You also correctly emphasize that the magnitude of increase required for a Yes outcome is not plausible within the time remaining and current surveillance/reporting infrastructure, especially under conditions of a government shutdown. By balancing the theoretical risk of mutation against real-world historical precedent and surveillance capacity, your probability estimate is both conservative and well anchored.

This means that even if a surveillance artifact or reporting backlog occurred, it is highly implausible for such an artifact to yield a surge from under 100 to over 10,000 confirmed/probable cases within the next two months. Your argument recognizes the structural integrity of current surveillance and reporting systems, even under federal shutdown, and is aligned with the reality that a major change in either viral biology or reporting standards would be needed to reach a Yes outcome\u2014neither of which is evident.

Your recognition that reporting structures, even with delays, are unlikely to suddenly add thousands of cases in a short period, aligns with what surveillance theory predicts for high-consequence pathogens under strict reporting regimes.

You correctly note that, even if a single-point mutation occurred, such a change would almost certainly manifest as unmistakable epidemiological signals\u2014such as media reports of severe clusters or unexplained hospital surges\u2014well before it could result in 10,000 confirmed/probable cases within the short time frame. Your assessment that the government shutdown and related reporting bottlenecks would further constrain, rather than inflate, reported case numbers is highly relevant.

In veterinary medicine, we often see large-scale animal outbreaks fail to translate to similar human numbers precisely because of host specificity and interspecies transmission barriers. You accurately highlight that, absent a radical increase in the effective reproduction number (Re) in humans, which would itself be highly visible through clinical clusters and hospitalizations, the system simply cannot produce the volume of cases required in the available time. That approach, rooted in mechanistic modeling, appropriately places the probability at or near zero, and is strongly supported by both historical base rates and current transmission dynamics."

You also correctly point out that, even under stress (such as during a government shutdown), the CDC\u2019s reporting and case confirmation processes are robust enough that an unnoticed, explosive outbreak resulting in >10,000 reported cases is virtually impossible.

The original question opened on 2024-12-13 17:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/30960). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of December 11, 2024, CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) 58 human cases in the US for 2024 year-to-date. The page presents exposure sources for the cases, attributing 35 to cattle, 21 to poultry, and two to unknown causes. CDC [describes](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/reported-human-infections.html) H5N1 infections in humans as follows:\n\n> HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 925 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997, including 20 cases and 7 deaths in Hong Kong during 1997-2003, and more than 900 cases reported in 24 countries since November 2003. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported. The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. [Total case counts](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html) reported since 1997 are available.\n\nThe spread of H5 avian influenza among birds and cattle and its spread to humans has [raised concerns](https://www.today.com/health/disease/bird-flu-pandemic-rcna183174) that it could turn into another pandemic. However, as of December 11, 2024, CDC's [summary of the current situation](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) states the following:\n\n> * Person-to-person spread: None\n> * Current public health risk: Low\n\nHistorically during outbreaks, CDC has used a case classification system to identify cases as confirmed, probable, or suspected. For example, see the [case classifications used for the mpox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html). Speaking generally, a confirmed case is one which is confirmed via laboratory testing, a probable case is one without reason to believe the symptoms may be caused by another disease coupled with some detected biological evidence, and a suspected case is one that exhibits comparable symptoms or has high clinical suspicion of being the disease in question.\n\nA genetic analysis of H5N1 published December 5, 2024 [found](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180) that a single mutation is all that is required for the virus to switch its [binding specificity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5605752/) from avian to human:\n\n> A single glutamine to leucine mutation at residue 226 of the virus hemagglutinin was sufficient to enact the change from avian to human specificity. In nature, the occurrence of this single mutation could be an indicator of human pandemic risk.\n\nSee also ScienceDaily: [Scientists identify mutation that could facilitate H5N1 'bird flu' virus infection and potential transmission in humans](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/12/241205142418.htm)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":30960,\"question_id\":30732}}`",

Since the beginning of September, 7 million farmed birds have been infected nationwide, including 1.3 million turkeys, raising concerns about potential shortages ahead of Thanksgiving. The virus has spread across 33 states, with Michigan reporting the highest number of wild bird detections (54 flocks), followed by Minnesota (19), Colorado (17), and Kansas (16). Outbreaks have also been identified in dairy cows in Idaho, Nebraska, and Texas. Human cases have totaled 70 since last year, with one death reported in January involving an older adult with underlying health conditions. Most cases involved direct exposure to infected birds or cattle, though a Missouri patient was infected without known exposure, highlighting uncertainty in transmission pathways. The CDC\u2019s data tracking is delayed due to the government shutdown, but essential staff remain on duty. The USDA is using emergency funds for surveillance. While the virus can be transmitted through undercooked poultry or unpasteurized dairy, proper cooking (to 165\u00b0F) and pasteurization typically kill it. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Symptoms in humans include conjunctivitis, fever, cough, and fatigue, with rare severe outcomes like pneumonia and brain inflammation. Experts, including Richard Webby of St Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, say H5N1 has settled into a seasonal pattern, suggesting it will remain a persistent public health concern. Additionally, Thanksgiving turkeys may carry bacteria like salmonella and E. coli, which are eliminated by thorough cooking. Wholesale turkey prices are already 40% higher than last year, according to Bernt Nelson of the American Farm Bureau Federation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:38 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15254121/highly-contagious-bird-flu-food-safety-thanksgiving.html)\n\n**Review: Human H5N1 avian flu cases can be asymptomatic, and the virus likely spreads among people**\nA scoping review by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), published in JAMA Network Open on October 29, 2025, reveals that asymptomatic human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) occur and that person-to-person transmission is likely in certain settings. The study analyzed data from 10 reports identifying 18 asymptomatic H5N1 cases, including 2 with molecular and serologic confirmation (MSC) and 16 with molecular confirmation alone (MC). Two MSC cases were identified in adults in Pakistan and Vietnam through household contact investigations; one had exposure to infected poultry, while the other likely contracted the virus through human-to-human transmission, with no poultry contact. Of the 16 MC cases, 11 were found through enhanced surveillance of poultry-exposed individuals (8 in Bangladesh, 2 in Spain, 1 in the UK), and 5 were identified via contact tracing (3 in Vietnam, 2 in Cambodia). The authors emphasize the need for robust data collection from asymptomatic individuals to inform public health responses. In a related commentary, Rick Bright and Nicole Lurie note that since March 2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has spread among dairy cattle, with over 800 infected herds in at least 16 US states. As of mid-2025, approximately 70 human cases have been reported, mostly mild, with at least one death. High viral loads have been detected in raw milk, and live virus has been found in mammary tissue and milking equipment. Spillover to other mammals\u2014including cats, dogs, mice, wild carnivores, marine mammals, and swine\u2014has been documented. The authors challenge the traditional view that H5N1 infections in humans are always severe and that human-to-human transmission does not occur, calling attention to a critical gap in surveillance systems that focus on symptomatic illness rather than infection detection, and stressing the importance of investigating clusters for potential limited transmission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:16 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/review-human-h5n1-avian-flu-cases-can-be-asymptomatic-and-virus-likely)\n\n**Video: Avian Influenza: Answers to the Most Important Questions About the New Disease**\nThe avian influenza (bird flu) has emerged as a new public health concern following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primarily affecting birds, the disease has now spread to other animals including cats and cows, and in rare cases, humans. The Robert Koch Institute confirms over 2,600 human cases worldwide since 2003, with the H5N1 variant causing particular concern; however, no human-to-human transmission has been documented. H5N1 cases are currently reported in Asia and the Americas, with outbreaks among dairy cows in the United States since March 2024. The virus has not yet been detected in Europe, but there is a potential risk of introduction via trade in cattle or beef products. Transmission occurs mainly through raw milk, not airborne routes. The risk to people working with animals is considered low to moderate. Symptoms include fever, cough, breathing difficulties, and in severe cases, pneumonia; gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting may also occur. Finland plans a vaccination campaign for high-risk groups, while Germany is not participating in the EU\u2019s vaccine procurement. Prevention includes consuming only pasteurized milk and thoroughly cooking meat. Treatment involves antiviral medications such as baloxavir, oseltamivir, or zanamivir, as antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections, according to the Science Media Center.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[RP Online](https://rp-online.de/leben/gesundheit/vogelgrippe-antworten-auf-die-wichtigsten-fragen-zur-neuen-krankheit_vid-117390457)\n\n**H9N2 Avian Influenza: Rising Human Infection Risk Sparks Pandemic Warning**\nThe H9N2 avian influenza virus, previously considered a mild 'common cold-level' infection, is now being warned as a potential pandemic threat due to increased human cell adaptability and infection capability. According to a study led by Professor Kelvin To from the University of Hong Kong and published in the international journal Nature on October 27, 2025, the H9N2 virus has undergone genetic changes that allow it to bind more effectively to human respiratory cells compared to the 1999 strain. While no human-to-human transmission cases have been reported, researchers believe the virus is in an early stage of adapting to humans. The study, published in 'Emerging Microbes & Infections' on October 16, 2025, and presented at the Pandemic Research Consortium International Symposium in Melbourne on October 27, highlights concerns that H9N2's low pathogenicity classification allows countries to not report cases internationally, increasing the risk of unnoticed spread. Additionally, Michelle Wille from the Doherty Institute in Melbourne warns that H9N2 infections may be underdiagnosed because they cause mild symptoms and are often overlooked in testing that focuses primarily on the more lethal H5N1 strain. The study cautions that co-infection in animals could lead to genetic recombination and the emergence of new, more dangerous variants.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:30 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/science-chosun/science/2025/10/29/RBHD6WCMWFFKNHAYFJ7LQFDFDA/)\n\n**H5N1 Avian Flu Ravages the U.S. as Federal Government Shutdown Undermines Public Health Response**\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread across the United States, affecting over 1,761 commercial and backyard poultry farms in nearly 50 states by early 2024, with a significant shift in 2024 when it began infecting dairy cattle across 18 states and 976 farms by July 2025. This marked the first widespread mammalian transmission, leading to 70 confirmed human cases by May 2025\u2014up from just one in 2022\u2014with 41 linked to contact with infected cows and 24 to poultry farms. Despite the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stating the public health risk remains 'low' and no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, global health experts are alarmed by viral adaptations observed in Kansas cattle and rising case numbers. The outbreak has triggered economic devastation: over 168 million poultry have been culled since December 2024, reducing egg supply by 7%\u201310% and driving the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs to $5.89 in February 2025\u2014peaking above $8\u2014up from $4.10 in late 2024. The USDA paid over $1.4 billion in compensation between January 2022 and November 2024. The crisis intensified in September 2025, with nearly 7 million farm birds dead, including 1.3 million turkeys, threatening Thanksgiving supplies. Wild bird infections surged, and outbreaks were confirmed in Idaho, Nebraska, and Texas. The pandemic coincided with a federal government shutdown due to partisan budget disputes, which severely disrupted the public health response. The CDC\u2019s official avian flu website displayed a notice stating it was 'under revision in accordance with a presidential executive order,' and the agency ceased publishing its vital biweekly H5N1 situation summaries starting January 17, 2025. Although emergency plans claimed essential services would continue, in practice, data collection, analysis, and oversight were halted. The CDC acknowledged delays in monitoring report analysis and inability to guide state and local health departments. Systemic damage included the dismissal of public health inspectors, freezing of NIH research funding reviews, and massive cuts to USAID personnel, leading to the abrupt termination of U.S. surveillance programs in 49 countries. The shutdown, a political choice rather than a natural disaster, turned the public health system into a casualty of partisan conflict, severely undermining the CDC\u2019s credibility as the nation\u2019s source of truth. This erosion of trust\u2014critical during any pandemic\u2014inflicted lasting damage on America\u2019s most vital intangible asset: public confidence in science and government.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:07 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://technews.tw/2025/10/28/with-h5n1-bird-flu-ravaging-the-u-s-the-federal-government-cuts-research-budgets-and-shuts-down/)\n\n**Germany Sacrifices Over 500,000 Birds to Contain Avian Influenza Outbreak**\nOver 500,000 birds have been slaughtered in Germany to contain the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to data released by the German national zoonosis research center, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), on October 27, 2025. Since early September, 31 outbreaks have been detected in poultry farms, leading to the culling of chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys. Additionally, 73 cases have been identified in wild birds since last month. In Neutrebbin near Berlin, a farm sacrificed 50,000 chickens, with the birds loaded into a truck using a backhoe. A FLI spokesperson noted that the numbers are snapshots of a rapidly evolving situation and reflect the scale of the epizootic rather than exact totals. The disease has spread more rapidly than usual, with unprecedented mortality among wild cranes in Brandenburg, where volunteers in protective gear collected hundreds of dead birds near Berlin. The Ministry of Agriculture, led by Minister Alois Raine, emphasized the need to prevent viral spread, protect animals, and safeguard agriculture and food industries. Wild birds migrating from southern regions are the primary carriers, with infection risk increasing significantly during autumn migration. The FLI warns that more cases are expected. Concerns are rising over potential price increases for chicken and eggs, prompting calls to confine free-range birds in enclosed facilities. The German Poultry Industry Association president, Hans-Peter Goldnick, supports nationwide confinement as the most effective measure. However, Robert Schmack, head of Bavaria\u2019s Poultry Union, warns of up to a 40% price surge for eggs and reduced supermarket variety. Goldnick disputes this, stating no short-term price spikes are expected, especially around Christmas, due to most geese being imported from Hungary and Poland. Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease caused by mutated influenza viruses, fatal to turkeys and chickens. Human infections are rare and typically occur only through contact with infected birds; the fatality rate is about 50%. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the past two decades, the virus has infected around 950 people, resulting in approximately 460 deaths. The FLI advises avoiding contact with dead birds and not using contaminated boots near vulnerable poultry.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 09:50 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/alemanha-sacrifica-500-mil-aves-para-conter-gripe-avi%C3%A1ria/a-74518245)\n\n**What is Avian Influenza?**\nThe avian influenza virus H5N1, which spreads annually with the migration of wild birds, has caused continuous and nearly global outbreaks in wild and domestic birds since autumn 2021. The virus has returned to Germany with significant force, resulting in over 30 outbreaks in poultry farms and the culling of approximately 400,000 birds. In the past weeks, dead wild birds have been found at more than 70 locations across nearly all regions of Germany. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut emphasizes that the current situation is a snapshot, and the virus is likely to spread rapidly as the peak of bird migration approaches. Experts predict that meat and egg prices may rise significantly during the pre-Christmas period. While the virus has not yet posed a danger to humans, it has infected numerous mammals, and at least 70 human cases have been reported in the United States, mostly with mild symptoms. Crucially, human-to-human transmission has not occurred. However, specialists remain alarmed, warning that mutations could potentially make H5N1 dangerous for humans in the future.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 01:39 PM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/meinung/vogelgrippe-h5n1-virus-lexikon-li.3330783)\n\n**Mexico reports new human case of H5 bird flu - BNO News**\nMexico has reported a new human case of H5 avian influenza in a 23-year-old woman in Mexico City, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The patient, who had no recent travel history, developed symptoms on September 14, beginning with respiratory issues such as a runny nose and cough, which progressed to fever, painful swallowing, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), and chest pain. She was hospitalized and tested positive for unsubtypeable influenza A on September 29; real-time RT-PCR confirmed the presence of influenza A(H5) the following day. She was treated with oseltamivir and discharged on October 11. Health authorities noted that a dog and several birds\u2014including a poultry bird and two pigeons\u2014lived at her residence, with bird droppings found in multiple areas, including a poorly sealed cistern supplying water to all apartments. Environmental samples are still being analyzed, but animal samples tested positive for influenza A(H5). All 41 identified contacts of the patient tested negative for the virus. The specific H5 subtype remains unknown. This marks Mexico\u2019s second human case of avian influenza in 2024, following a fatal H5N2 case in the State of Mexico. Earlier in the year, a 3-year-old girl in northern Mexico died from an H5N1 infection linked to Genotype D1.1, which has also caused severe illness in a teenager in Canada and an adult in Wyoming, and a fatal case in Louisiana\u2014the first confirmed H5N1 death in the U.S. The H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b and its genotypes have raised global health concerns due to their wide geographic spread and ability to infect birds and mammals. Since 2022, at least 92 human infections with this clade have been reported worldwide, mostly associated with contact with infected poultry or dairy cattle.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 09:18 PM\nSource:[BNO News](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2025/10/mexico-reports-new-human-case-of-h5-bird-flu/)\n\n**Mexico reports new human case of H5 bird flu**\nMexico has reported a new human case of H5 avian influenza in a 23-year-old woman in Mexico City, according to health officials.

Despite these developments, human cases remain limited, with only one case detected in May 2022 (Canada) and no confirmed human-to-human transmission. Three leading theories explain the low human mortality: (1) pre-existing immunity from prior exposure to seasonal or past influenza strains, particularly the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which may offer cross-protection; (2) viral adaptation and host specificity, as the virus remains primarily adapted to birds and has not yet evolved efficient human-to-human transmission; and (3) limited human exposure, with most cases linked to direct contact with infected poultry, especially among culling workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. CDC emphasize continued surveillance to detect any changes in the virus that could increase transmissibility or virulence. Recent findings confirm H5N1 was detected in raw cow\u2019s milk in the U.S., with high concentrations reported, and studies show that past H1N1 immunity may shield against severe H5N1 illness. The risk to the general public remains low, but vigilance is essential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:03 PM\nSource:[world-today-news.com](https://www.world-today-news.com/h5n1-flu-why-north-america-isnt-more-deadly/)\n\n**California Child Infected With H5N1 Bird Flu, Source Unknown**\nA San\u202fFrancisco child infected with H5N1 bird flu in December\u202f2024 was identified through enhanced surveillance, but no clear source of exposure was found. The case, reported by the San\u202fFrancisco Department of Public Health and the CDC in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on September\u202f4\u202f2025, involved a school\u2011aged child who exhibited typical flu\u2011like symptoms\u2014fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and conjunctivitis\u2014for about a week before testing positive for H5N1. Authorities traced 67 close contacts\u2014including household members, classmates, and health\u2011care providers\u2014but all tested samples were negative, leaving no evidence of onward transmission. The child had not traveled, visited farms, or been near poultry or wild birds; the family had purchased poultry from a live\u2011bird market, but it was cooked and eaten well before the illness began. Genetic sequencing identified the virus as clade\u202f2.3.4.4b, genotype\u202fB3.13, the same lineage driving the California dairy outbreak and found in cats and wild birds, yet it lacked mutations associated with efficient human\u2011to\u2011human transmission. This case is one of 70 confirmed U.S. H5N1 infections since 2023, with only three\u2014this one included\u2014having no identifiable source. American cases have largely been mild, with one death reported, contrasting with the higher fatality rates seen globally. The incident underscores gaps in understanding environmental reservoirs and transmission pathways of H5N1 in urban settings and highlights the need for rapid diagnostic capacity and robust surveillance. The CDC currently rates the risk to the public as 'low', but the unknowns remain significant.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndrake/2025/09/05/california-child-infected-with-h5n1-bird-flu-source-unknown/)\n\n**Seventy U.S. Bird Flu Cases Underscore How Much We Still Don't Know**\nBetween March\u202f2024 and May\u202f2025, 70 human H5N1 infections were confirmed in the United States, with 4 requiring hospitalization and 1 fatality \u2013 a mortality rate far lower than the roughly 50\u202f% global rate for H5N1.  The CDC study led by Melissa\u202fRolfes found that 59\u202f% of cases were linked to dairy cows, about a third to commercial poultry, and two to backyard poultry; all cases involved direct animal contact, and three had no clear source but genetic sequencing tied them to cattle\u2011associated viruses.  Rolfes notes that the virus has not spread efficiently between people, as none of 180 household contacts tested positive for H5 antibodies.  The study attributes the milder U.S. cases to factors such as younger, healthier workers, rapid monitoring and treatment, and limited exposure dose.  Ninety\u2011one percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino, reflecting the agricultural workforce.  No new U.S. cases have been reported since February\u202f2025, but surveillance continues.  \"The 70 human cases of A(H5N1) in the U.S. continue to be linked to exposure to infected or dead animals, mostly dairy cows and commercial poultry,\" Rolfes said, adding, \"There have been 2 cases associated with exposure to infected poultry kept in backyards; both cases were hospitalized and 1 of these patients unfortunately died.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 27, 2025 11:40 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndrake/2025/08/27/bird-flu-in-the-us-seventy-human-cases-mostly-mild-but-with-warning-signs/)\n\n**Human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in the United States from March 2024 to May 2025 - Nature Medicine**\nBetween March 2024 and October 2024, 46 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) were detected in the United States. An additional 24 cases were reported between November 2024 and May 2025, bringing the total to 70 human cases. Most cases (89%) reported eye redness, 46% fever, and 41% respiratory symptoms. Four patients were hospitalized, with three having pneumonia and one death. No human-to-human transmission was detected. Occupational exposure to infected animals was a risk factor for HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection, and ongoing vigilance is warranted, particularly for cases exposed to backyard poultry or with unidentified sources of exposure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03905-2)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts overwhelmingly agree that it is extremely unlikely the CDC will report 10,000 or more H5 avian influenza cases in the United States before January 1, 2026. As of late 2025, the CDC has reported approximately 70 human cases, nearly all linked to direct animal exposure and not to sustained human-to-human transmission. Historic and international base rates for reported human H5 infections are likewise very low: globally, fewer than 1,000 cases have been documented over decades. Experts note that official CDC case counts (which for this question must be confirmed or probable) would require a massive, unprecedented, and immediate shift to efficient human-to-human transmission to generate thousands of cases within the few remaining weeks. While recent scientific findings acknowledge the theoretical possibility of a single mutation enabling human-adapted transmission, no evidence of such a mutation or widespread human transmission currently exists in the U.S. or globally. Surveillance or reporting disruptions due to the government shutdown are not seen as plausible mechanisms for inflating the official reported count to this threshold. Even allowing for some uncertainty due to unforeseen genetic shifts, all experts assign vanishingly low probabilities (generally 0\u20131%) to a Yes resolution, with every expert stressing that only a catastrophic, historically unique event (a sudden, severe pandemic beginning very soon) could change this outlook. The consensus is clear: the status quo is highly robust against a rapid, massive increase in reported human H5 cases within the short time frame provided, barring an immediately observable and globally detected pandemic event.",
