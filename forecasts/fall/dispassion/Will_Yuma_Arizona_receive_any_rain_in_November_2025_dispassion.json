I also note that the absence of any forecasted synoptic system for mid-November justifies a more status-quo-anchored probability. While I still see some justification for a marginally elevated probability due to improved antecedent moisture and rare tail risk, the consensus points to a more cautious adjustment. Therefore, I am revising my probability downward to 33% to better reflect the climatological base rate and the current meteorological setup.",

There is broad agreement that there are no current synoptic signals or forecasts indicating rain, so tail risk from cut-off lows or unexpected systems is the only real source of uncertainty above the base rate. My initial probability (33%) is near the high end of the consensus, but still within range. However, the additional critiques suggest that a more precise calibration would be to align with the lower end of the justified range, given that antecedent wetness is not a strong driver and the status quo is historically dry.

Critiques of higher probabilities (like mine at 37% and others at 38%) center on the lack of a predictive link between recent wetness and November rain, and the absence of any forthcoming synoptic triggers in short- or medium-range forecasts. Defenses of probabilities in the low 30s emphasize status quo bias, the strong tendency for dry Novembers, and the weak predictive power of antecedent moisture. Given this, I recognize that my initial upward adjustment above the base rate was somewhat over-weighted on improved regional moisture and rare late-season events.

Intense rainfall is anticipated, with a projected 1150 mm of precipitation\u2014about 85% of the historical average\u2014spread over five days, including episodes of short-duration heavy rain that could cause localized flooding. The rainy season may start as late as the second half of December. Temperatures are expected to be slightly above average, with highs reaching up to 36\u202f\u00b0C, particularly on the west coast, accompanied by high humidity and light winds, creating uncomfortable conditions. Cyclone activity is also forecasted, with over ten moderate tropical storms expected, forming primarily east of Diego Garcia.

The October 2025 weather, marked by heat, storms, and near-freezing temperatures (2\u20136\u202f\u00b0C, with a low of 2.5\u202f\u00b0C in Chacabuco), did not harm the wheat, which was in the advanced pasty stage\u2014reducing frost risk. Rainfall averaged 105\u202fmm across 36 GEA stations, the fourth consecutive month above normal, with Pergamino recording 160\u202fmm, crucial for grain filling. Wheat yields are projected to exceed 40 quintals per hectare in most areas, with some zones like Corral de Bustos seeing yields of 40\u201370\u202fqq/ha, and Marcos Ju\u00e1rez anticipating 45\u201350\u202fqq/ha. The key determinant of success will be fertilization: well-nourished crops are expected to break records, while under-fertilized ones will be limited. Maize, though affected by cold, remains resilient due to prior good leaf development and moisture, with recovery expected as temperatures rise. However, soya planting remains behind schedule, with only 10% of 3.2 million hectares sown, due to saturated soils and persistent rain in Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. In Ca\u00f1ada de G\u00f3mez, some fields show damping off and planchado due to excess moisture.

The region has transitioned from extreme drought in 2023 to abundant water and exceptional yield potential in 2025. Agronomists across the region, including in Aldao, Pergamino, and Carlos Pellegrini, echo the sentiment: 'Zafamos'\u2014'We got through it'\u2014now less as relief and more as celebration.

However, soya planting remains behind schedule, with only 10% of 3.2 million hectares sown, due to saturated soils and persistent rain in Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. In Ca\u00f1ada de G\u00f3mez, some fields show damping off and planchado due to excess moisture. The forecast for early November includes intermittent rains and temperature swings (up to 32\u202f\u00b0C, then a cold front), but the overall climate pattern\u2014moderate temperatures, adequate moisture, and no severe frost\u2014has made October a pivotal month. The region has transitioned from extreme drought in 2023 to abundant water and exceptional yield potential in 2025. Agronomists across the region, including in Aldao, Pergamino, and Carlos Pellegrini, echo the sentiment: 'Zafamos'\u2014'We got through it'\u2014now less as relief and more as celebration. The wheat has not only survived frost but emerged as the central figure of a campaign poised to enter history.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 02:25 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/campo/2025/11/02/el-trigo-esquivo-el-frio-y-consolida-una-campana-historica-en-la-region-nucleo/)\n\n**November Begins with Below-Average Autumn Sunshine and High Rainfall Risk, Typhoon Season May Persist**\nAccording to the latest one-month forecast, November 2025 is expected to see rainfall levels near or above average nationwide, particularly in western and northern Pacific-side regions of Japan. The forecast indicates a high likelihood of heavy rains continuing into November, with numerical weather models suggesting an increased chance of low-pressure systems forming over the South China Sea, implying the typhoon season may not have ended. On November 1 (Saturday), a rapidly developing low-pressure system and frontal zone caused record-breaking rainfall across northern Japan. In Futaba District, Fukushima Prefecture, a peak rainfall of 86.5 mm per hour was recorded, setting a new historical record since 1976. In Hiraizumi District, Iwate Prefecture, 146.0 mm of rain fell in six hours, the highest November rainfall on record. Over 100 locations recorded their highest November 6-hour rainfall totals. The forecast for November 1\u201330 indicates above-average rainfall nationwide, with fewer sunny autumn days than usual. The increased rainfall is attributed to a higher likelihood of influence from low-pressure systems and fronts. Numerical models predict lower sea-level pressure over the South China Sea, indicating a higher chance of low-pressure development. As of noon on November 1, a tropical depression was active near the Caroline Islands, expected to strengthen into Typhoon 25 within 24 hours. Currently, it is projected to move westward with low risk of approaching Japan, but sea surface temperatures remain above average, raising concerns that the typhoon season may continue into November. Meteorologist Yu Suzuki warns continued vigilance is necessary.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 06:56 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/0ea9b5d48fc4d6431938c2ae52fc48c9bf9e2199)\n\n**Yuma locals prepare for upcoming rain**\nResidents of Yuma, Arizona, are preparing for incoming rainfall expected this week, triggered by the remnants of Tropical Storm Priscilla.

    "summary": "Across all eight experts, there is a strong consensus that the probability of Yuma, Arizona receiving measurable rain (as defined by the official National Weather Service station) in November 2025 is below 50%, though not negligible. Forecasters converged on probabilities ranging from 28% to 38%, with most clustering around the base rate of ~30-40% for measurable November precipitation in Yuma.\n\nKey commonalities emerged in their reasoning:\n- Climatology is paramount: All described Yuma as one of the driest US cities, with November rain historically infrequent. Historical base rates put the chance of November rain between roughly 25% and 40%.\n- The 2025 late monsoon and early fall were wetter than average, and drought status improved, which slightly elevates\u2014but does not fundamentally change\u2014the probability for November rain. \n- Most experts noted that recent October 2025 rain was due to tropical remnants (e.g., Priscilla), and while such patterns can occasionally persist, tropical moisture advection rarely extends into November at significant levels.\n- There are no news articles or forecast indications of imminent rain systems targeting Yuma in early or mid-November 2025. Numerical weather models as of early November show no incoming disturbances; the status quo is dry.\n- The potential for a surprise event (cutoff low, unusual Pacific trough, or stray tropical system) was recognized but considered low likelihood, typical of the region's stochastic rainfall pattern in late fall. \n- ENSO and large-scale climate drivers (El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a) are neutral to slightly suppressive for precipitation; no strong signal exists to force higher-than-base-rate odds.\n\nTypical 'no' scenarios involve persistent dominance of high pressure, a lack of significant Pacific or subtropical disturbances, and every day of November recording 0.00\" precipitation. 'Yes' scenarios revolve around a rogue cutoff low or rare late-season tropical moisture event yielding a single measurable rain day.\n\nFinal probabilities cluster just above the historical base rate, generally 28% to 38%, reflecting both the deeply ingrained aridity and a modest nod to the region\u2019s anomalous recent rainfall history. No expert sees either outcome as overwhelmingly likely, but the overall view is that a dry November remains the default expectation for Yuma in 2025.",
