Given 17 days remain and Congressional leaders are under strong external pressure, the probability is lower than 'routine' shutdowns, but not minimal.

The Trump administration\u2019s open appetite for inflicting bureaucratic pain, engineering mass layoffs, and denying the guarantees of back pay means your \u2018cost\u2019 variables are endogenous to the White House\u2019s own goals\u2014NOT exogenous shocks that force retreat. The system\u2019s usual incentive-alignment is broken: gridlock and chaos ARE, for some, the point. The Senate, meanwhile, has sustained maximal public and constituent agony through prolonged deadlock without even signaling movement. Thus, your presumption that rising costs automatically tip the actors\u2019 hands is naive to this moment\u2019s strategic innovation: true believers, not minimaxers, are setting the pace\u2014and the base rates for \u2018brink deals\u2019 simply don\u2019t apply.

Yes, the House is out, but reconvening takes hours, not weeks, when a deal materializes (it\u2019s happened before). And don\u2019t pretend Senate proceduralism is an iron wall: as with all shutdowns, enough moderate cross-pressure (think airline CEOs, furious governors, key donor blocs) can force holdouts to blink or leadership to tweak side deals for a temporary truce. You treat institutional barriers as static and ignore how brinkmanship games turn brittle when payoff differentials spike. If you think party discipline or executive will guarantees endless gridlock\u2014ignoring mounting negative payoffs and the historical collapse of similar impasses at pain thresholds\u2014you overrate inertia and underrate the system\u2019s capacity for abrupt reversal when forced. In sum: yes, Newtonian mechanics don\u2019t work here, but this is not an unconstrained deadlock. When the public cost is unambiguously catastrophic, even the most dug-in actors find a rational face-saving way out. Dismiss game theory at your peril."

Sure, it's tempting to imagine the looming symbolism of Thanksgiving and the long tradition of American aversion to ruinous gridlock will, like magic, 'snap' Congress and the administration into action. But what you're really describing is a folk ritual of American politics, not the hard calculus of institutional incentives. You admit the holiday has symbolic power\u2014but symbolism has so far failed to move even a single vote toward cloture, and has not dragged the House back into session. The administration is deliberately wielding the shutdown as a tool of lasting administrative demolition; elite and popular pressure have not registered. To lean on 'cultural tendency' as a rescue plan is to confuse past luck for present logic. Historical narratives do not break filibusters or prompt cross-party deals in rooms where incentives have changed. Until you focus on the actual mechanisms, you risk being blindsided by an extraordinary and protracted standoff that cares nothing for turkey dinners or shared national myths."

You're ignoring the redefinition of pain as political capital by the executive; prolonged agony is being spun (and believed) as strength and reform by enough actors to embolden the existing deadlock. The expectation that moderates will defect as suffering mounts is classic civics textbook thinking, but the present party structures crush dissent, punish compromise, and reward loyalty to the maximalist line. There are no bipartisan statesmen waiting in the wings\u2014the last 35 days prove it. The pressure you're hoping for has been absorbed, redirected, or dismissed as partisan noise. Predicting a deal because 'that's how it's always been' is cultural nostalgia, not analysis.

Unlike past shutdowns, there is no evidence that traditional levers (public pressure, airline chaos, hunger risks) are compelling either side to moderate. The filibuster remains intact, House is inactive, and the legislative/executive postures are maximalist and inflexible.

The lack of movement in Senate crossovers, a House absent from Washington, the removal of back pay guarantees, and open executive willingness to use the shutdown for permanent restructuring all indicate a higher probability of an historic, even longer shutdown than previously thought. While I continue to believe that mounting pain and deadline proximity make some form of off-ramp likelier as we approach November 21, the probabilities of a continued shutdown past this point are materially higher than I initially allowed. Therefore, I am revising my probability down to 62%, a more moderate position that still reflects above-even odds for resolution, but better accounts for the unprecedented political and institutional context.",

However, multiple compelling counter-arguments from Public Choice and Appropriations experts stress the inevitability of mounting political pain forcing a concession or at least a narrow CR, particularly as critical holiday deadlines approach. While I remain cautious given this administration's higher demonstrated tolerance for pain and unorthodox strategy, I now believe the probability of an eleventh-hour resolution is somewhat higher\u2014given the risks to both parties if travel chaos and social welfare pain hit at Thanksgiving.

The most optimistic forecasters (62%, 80%) rely heavily on historical base rates or the political class\u2019s aversion to public suffering, but as I and several others (notably LegislativeAffairsCongressionalProcedure, PublicAdministrationIntergovernmentalRelations, AmericanStudiesFederalGovernmentSystem) argued, this shutdown\u2019s context is novel in both intent and procedure. There is marginal case to nudge the probability downward given the full absence of forward movement after maximal pain (flight chaos, SNAP/WIC cutoffs, missed pay), especially since all established 'pain thresholds' have failed to trigger congressional brakes thus far and Thanksgiving itself may not be sufficient. However, the possibility of a last-moment CR or surprise bipartisan movement remains very real if constituent and business pressure suddenly reaches a critical mass.

The one forecast above 70% (AppropriationsProcess) was rightly criticized for underweighting unique context; more pessimistic outlooks were criticized for assuming politics is static and actors are truly inured to electoral/constituent risk.

My own view, rooted in Public Choice, was already cautious and balanced: recognizing the increasing probability of an eleventh-hour deal as pain and visibility intensify, but also the radical, hardline stance distinguishing this episode. On balance, given that the consensus among the sharpest panelists is more cautious than my initial read and that there is increased plausibility of a lasting impasse, I am revising downward to better weight the unprecedented nature of the deadlock\u2014but not radically, as the incentives for a late save remain.

Reading the group discussion, particularly critiques from LegislativeAffairsCongressionalProcedure and PublicAdministrationFederalBudgetProcess, underscores that this shutdown is not just an unusually severe standoff, but one where historical precedent is less reliable because a single actor\u2014namely the executive\u2014is leveraging the crisis for deep structural/ideological change and even appears to value conflict and dysfunction for their own sake, severely weakening the usual pressure-release mechanisms. The unusually inflexible Senate and absentee House further raise the bar for a face-saving off-ramp. Even though there is still mounting pressure on the system (as many pointed out), the legislative path for resolution is more fraught and vulnerable to collapse than I credited, and the probability of 'black-swan' style record duration is higher than my initial model allowed for. Thus, in light of group consensus trending notably lower (with most clustering in the 35\u201365% range, and only one outlier higher), and after accounting for the real risk that the traditional pressure points do not break the current deadlock, I am reducing my estimate to better reflect the increased tail risk\u2014but I still retain a modestly positive expectation of a deal before Thanksgiving, due to mounting costs and historical resolution patterns.",

The House has not been in session since September 19, and the shutdown began on October 1. Senate Majority Leader John Thune expressed cautious optimism about reaching a deal this week, citing weekend discussions, but emphasized that progress must be evident by midweek to meet the goal of sending a bill back to the House before the Senate recesses for Veterans Day. Thune opposes invoking the 'nuclear option' to eliminate the filibuster, stating there is insufficient support among Republicans for such a move, despite pressure from former President Donald Trump.

The shutdown began on October 1 after the Senate failed to advance a House-passed resolution to fund the government through November 21, despite 13 failed votes. Of the 100 Senate members, 52 Republicans supported the resolution, while 43 Democrats and independents opposed it, including one Republican, Senator Rand Paul, who opposes the bill due to concerns over national debt. Only three Democrats/independents\u2014Sens. John Fetterman, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Angus King\u2014voted in favor. Senate Majority Leader John Thune stated that five Democratic senators would need to switch their votes to advance the bill. The shutdown has resulted in 670,000 federal workers being furloughed and 730,000 essential workers continuing to work without pay. Over 4,000 federal employees were targeted for layoffs, though a court has blocked those actions. Approximately 42 million Americans will lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits on November 1, with a $9.2 billion cost to fund benefits for November, though the Agriculture Department\u2019s $5 billion contingency fund cannot be legally accessed.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown has caused at least $7 billion in sustained economic losses, with GDP dropping 1 percentage point after four weeks and 2 points after eight weeks. The shutdown\u2019s economic impact is partially reversible, but long-term damage persists.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 02:29 PM\nSource:[Aol](https://www.aol.com/articles/2025-u-government-shutdown-numbers-192107375.html)\n\n**As they miss paychecks, furloughed federal workers are taking out bank loans to help pay the bills**\nAs the U.S. government shutdown entered its 30th day on November 1, 2025, furloughed federal workers are increasingly turning to zero-interest loans to cover essential expenses. A San Antonio woman, whose husband works for the Department of Defense, shared with CBS News that her family took a $3,200 no-interest loan from USAA to avoid financial hardship, stating they 'would have been in trouble' without it. USAA has issued over $365 million in such loans to more than 119,000 federal employees since the shutdown began on October 1, 2025. The loans, available up to $6,000 and repayable within 90 days, are designed to replace one net paycheck and carry no fees or interest. USAA, serving 14 million military, veteran, and family members, offers these loans as part of its crisis response. Navy Federal Credit Union is also providing a 'Paycheck Assistance Program' with similar no-interest loans up to $6,000, repaid automatically once employees receive back pay. Federal workers who miss paychecks are entitled to back pay once agencies reopen. The financial strain is compounded by delayed insurance claims and mounting bills, according to the woman, who emphasized that 'Insurance took some time to process it all, and things are starting to come in at a really bad time.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 01:08 PM\nSource:[news9.com](https://www.news9.com/story/69064c761328bc922242a4df/as-they-miss-paychecks-furloughed-federal-workers-are-taking-out-bank-loans-to-help-pay-the-bills)\n\n**This government shutdown is not like the others: Furloughed federal workers explain**\nA federal government shutdown that began on October 1, 2025, has now lasted nearly three weeks, affecting at least 700,000 federal employees who have been furloughed and nearly as many who are working without pay. The shutdown, unlike previous ones, is being used by President Trump and his administration to pursue aggressive restructuring of the federal bureaucracy, including mass firings, the elimination of programs, and the use of unorthodox budgetary maneuvers\u2014some of which have been blocked by a federal judge but may still proceed. Federal workers across agencies report a toxic work environment marked by fear, instability, and systemic breakdowns. Adam, a recreation specialist with the US Forest Service in Idaho, describes a decline in staffing due to the deferred resignation program and a loss of morale, with trail maintenance now halted. Ellen, an employee at the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, highlights the disruption to SNAP and other nutrition programs, with states left without federal guidance on compliance and funding, and notes that her coworkers are volunteering at food banks to help fill the gap. April, from the Administration for Children and Families, emphasizes the interconnectedness of federal programs, particularly Head Start, SNAP, and refugee resettlement, and shares that the shutdown has disproportionately impacted Black federal workers and communities of color, many of whom have already left the workforce in record numbers. All three workers describe a coordinated effort by the administration to make federal work unbearable, including the use of AI to generate wrongful RIF (reduction-in-force) notices, system failures, and the erosion of union power. Despite this, solidarity among federal workers has grown, with increased organizing through groups like the Federal Unionists Network. The shutdown is not seen as a temporary disruption but as part of a broader strategy to dismantle public services and replace them with privatized or underfunded alternatives, according to the workers. The article underscores that the impact extends far beyond federal employees, affecting millions of Americans who rely on federal programs for food, housing, healthcare, and recreation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 04:59 PM\nSource:[therealnews.com](https://therealnews.com/this-government-shutdown-is-not-like-the-others-furloughed-federal-workers-explain)\n\n**U.S. Senate convenes on 34th day of shutdown with no vote taken**\nThe U.S. Senate reconvened on November 3, 2025, for the 34th day of a federal government shutdown, with no vote taken on a funding bill despite 13 failed procedural votes on a House-passed continuing resolution (CR) that would fund the government through November 21.

Since October 1, 2025, numerous federal agencies and offices have been closed or operating at reduced capacity, resulting in missed deadlines across critical sectors. Key missed deadlines include: the failure of the U.S. Senate to pass a temporary funding bill before federal funds were exhausted; the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics missing its October 3 deadline for the monthly employment report; the closure of the National Archives, museums, and cultural institutions on October 12, disrupting tourism in Washington, D.C.; the U.S. Department of Labor postponing the release of the September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on October 15; the U.S. federal court system exhausting its funds by October 20, leading to the unpaid furlough of 33,000 employees\u2014the first such event in nearly 30 years; the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration, under the Department of Energy, placing most staff on mandatory leave for the first time in its history; the October 28 payroll deadline for approximately 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, causing widespread flight delays and cancellations; the U.S. Department of Agriculture halting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on November 1, affecting 42 million low-income individuals and people with disabilities; and the postponement of the release of the third-quarter GDP data on October 30, forcing policymakers and businesses to operate without essential economic data. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, federal contractors lost an estimated $12 billion in the first four weeks of the shutdown, with small businesses losing $30 billion weekly. The Congressional Budget Office warned of potential losses between $7 billion and $14 billion if the shutdown continued. The shutdown could extend beyond 35 days, surpassing the 2018\u20132019 shutdown, if no temporary funding bill is passed by November 5. Analysts note that both parties are using the shutdown to advance political agendas, with Democrats demanding negotiations on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies and Republicans insisting on a vote on the funding bill first. Harvard scholar Linda Bilmes stated the shutdown severely undermines public confidence in government functionality.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 11:20 PM\nSource:[news.cri.cn](https://news.cri.cn/20251101/227028d6-d8d6-20eb-efef-2f8b5c3b6533.html)\n\n**Employees are receiving renewed furlough notices as shutdown enters second month, this time without back pay guarantees**\nThe U.S. government shutdown entered its second month on November 1, 2025, prompting federal agencies to issue renewed furlough notices to approximately 650,000 employees. These updated notices, required every 30 days, no longer include language guaranteeing back pay upon the shutdown's conclusion\u2014marking a significant departure from initial communications. Previously, notices from agencies like the General Services Administration and the Interior Department explicitly stated that employees would be paid retroactively under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. That language has since been removed, aligning with the Trump administration\u2019s recent legal argument that Congress must pass new legislation to authorize back pay, despite the 2019 law\u2019s clear intent to ensure retroactive compensation in all future shutdowns. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) deleted references to the law from its guidance, and the IRS initially promised back pay before retracting that statement and deleting the original email. Legal experts and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress have rejected the administration\u2019s stance, emphasizing that the law\u2019s plain text and legislative history support guaranteed back pay. In federal court, a Justice Department attorney affirmed that furloughed workers are entitled to back pay, noting they incur future obligations for the federal taxpayer. The financial implications could be substantial, with no scheduled vote to reopen government in the near term. The shutdown has already led to the loss of SNAP benefits for millions on November 1, widespread air traffic delays due to unpaid controllers, and missed paychecks for hundreds of thousands of 'excepted' workers. Senate Democrats insist on addressing ACA premium hikes and preventing unilateral spending clawbacks, while Republicans refuse to negotiate until the shutdown ends. Although some bipartisan talks on full-year appropriations are underway, no clear resolution has emerged. President Trump has called for eliminating the 60-vote filibuster to end the shutdown, but most Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune, oppose the move.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 06:38 PM\nSource:[Government Executive](https://www.govexec.com/pay-benefits/2025/10/employees-are-receiving-renewed-furlough-notices-shutdown-enters-second-month-time-without-back-pay-guarantees/409227/)\n\n**U.S. Government Shutdown Enters Month Two: Why Bipartisan Gridlock Persists**\nThe U.S. federal government has been partially shut down for a full month, with Congress failing to pass a temporary funding bill by the October 1 deadline, leading to a formal government 'shutdown' under U.S. law. Over 140,000 federal civilian employees are affected, with approximately half placed on unpaid furlough and the other half, deemed essential, continuing work without pay. The White House has directed agencies to prepare permanent layoff lists, with over 4,000 employees already receiving termination notices. The shutdown has disrupted critical services: the Bureau of Labor Statistics halted economic data releases, the CDC and FDA slowed operations, and federal civil case hearings were delayed. Aviation was severely impacted\u2014TSA staffing shortages at major airports, including JFK and LAX, led to flight delays and cancellations, with over 8,600 flights delayed on October 26 alone. The Congressional Budget Office warned that a prolonged shutdown could cost the U.S. economy between $7 billion and $14 billion. The crisis has become a political tool: President Trump's administration has redirected funds\u2014such as shifting defense research money to pay military salaries and reallocating $1 billion from border security to Coast Guard pay\u2014while avoiding public disclosure of funding sources. Critics, including legal scholars and Democratic lawmakers, argue this signals an expansion of executive power. Democrats, facing pressure after previous concessions, have adopted a united and hardline stance, with Senator Chris Murphy stating, 'We should stand firm, not yield.' Key political triggers are looming: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will exhaust funds on November 1, affecting 42 million people; the WIC program faces a $300 million funding gap; and Head Start programs will lose support, impacting over 800,000 children. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s open enrollment begins November 1, but subsidy expiration may force insurers to raise premiums by 2\u20133 times, risking enrollment collapse. Upcoming gubernatorial elections in New Jersey and Virginia may influence the outcome. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) urged Congress to pass a clean temporary funding bill immediately, stating, 'It\u2019s time to end this shutdown\u2014no half-measures, no political games.' With Thanksgiving approaching and federal workers still unpaid, public and political pressure is mounting.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 09:13 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5044281310_12ca99fde02002fwm8.html)\n\n**Bipartisan talks 'tick up' as Trump returns. Shutdown Day 30 live updates**\nAfter 30 days of a government shutdown, bipartisan conversations on Capitol Hill have seen a 'significant uptick,' according to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, as mounting disruptions intensify. Critical funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), used by over 40 million Americans, is set to expire on November 1, 2025, for the first time in history, with Democrats' efforts to protect it blocked in the Senate. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) also faces imminent funding exhaustion despite a recent emergency infusion. Sen. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n urged the Senate to pass a bill funding SNAP and WIC immediately, warning of a 'hunger crisis'\u2014a scenario described by Joel Berg of Hunger Free America as the 'greatest hunger catastrophe in America since the Great Depression.' The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at Newark Liberty International Airport due to staffing shortages, and similar disruptions affected flights to Los Angeles. Over 400,000 federal workers have been furloughed, reducing agency operations to fractions of normal capacity. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the shutdown will cost the U.S. economy between $7 billion and $14 billion, with no recovery possible for lost output from furloughed workers. House staff wages are delayed, with October paychecks postponed until the government reopens. Senate Majority Leader John Thune rejected Luj\u00e1n\u2019s bill, insisting on passing the House-passed temporary funding measure instead, criticizing Democrats for opposing 13 prior attempts to fund essential services. The shutdown\u2019s duration is projected to end between October 29 and November 26, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 11:24 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/bipartisan-talks-tick-trump-returns-112413087.html)\n\n**Government Shutdown Update: Monday, October 27, 2025**\nThe U.S. government shutdown entered its 35th day on November 4, 2025, tying the 2018\u20132019 shutdown as the longest in U.S. history. The Senate returned without voting on a continuing resolution (CR), while the House remains out of session, with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) indicating a day-by-day decision on reconvening. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) condemned the shutdown, calling it a 'national disgrace' that forces federal workers to work without pay, potentially threatening Democratic support among this key base. Key programs are set to lose funding on November 1: the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies expire, leading to an average 30% spike in premiums; SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) funding ends, affecting over 40 million Americans, with no emergency funding from the Trump Administration; WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) will run out of funds again despite a $300 million allocation earlier in October; Head Start will lose funding, risking teacher pay cuts and center closures. The Essential Air Service, critical for rural connectivity, faces shutdown by month\u2019s end, threatening travel, medical access, and commerce. On November 4, state elections in New Jersey, Virginia, New York, and California could signal public sentiment ahead of the midterms. By November 15, military service members may miss paychecks unless the government reopens, as current funding shifts are unsustainable. Air traffic controllers and TSA agents may miss pay on November 14, with the FAA warning of worsening flight disruptions\u20146,158 delays occurred on one recent Thursday. The shutdown\u2019s prolonged impact is expected to intensify constituent pressure, particularly as Thanksgiving approaches and Congress typically adjourns for the holiday, potentially disrupting travel.

This deadlock has led to the government shutdown extending beyond one month, with the potential to surpass the record 35-day shutdown under President Trump in 2018-2019 if it continues past November 5, 2025. The shutdown has triggered severe consequences: the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will cease funding for 42 million low-income individuals starting November 1, 2025, after the Department of Agriculture rejected a $500 million emergency request for SNAP reserve funds. Over 65,000 Head Start early childhood education programs will also lose federal funding, affecting more than 60,000 children nationwide. Federal employees, including military personnel, police, and firefighters, are working without pay for a month. Vice President JD Vance stated that military personnel would receive their salaries by the weekend, though the funding source was not disclosed. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) called for urgent negotiations, and Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) proposed compensating all federal workers\u2014both those on unpaid leave and those temporarily laid off. A federal judge in San Francisco, Susan Illston, issued a preliminary injunction to maintain a temporary halt on mass layoffs, declaring the dismissals 'illegal' and 'beyond authority,' though the Trump administration argues such personnel matters fall outside federal court jurisdiction.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 08:13 PM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251029003251071)\n\n**Pay for Trump and Congress continues in shutdown, unless they ask it be held**\nDuring the ongoing U.S. government shutdown beginning October 1, 2025, federal employees, including 2 million civilian workers and legislative staffers, have missed their first full paychecks, while members of Congress, the president, and federal judges continue to receive their regular salaries. Congress members are legally entitled to pay under the U.S. Constitution (Article I, Section 6, Clause 1) and the 27th Amendment, which prohibits changes to congressional compensation until after an election. Although Congress has voted multiple times to withhold salaries during shutdowns, no such bill has become law. Nonetheless, several lawmakers\u2014including Colorado Senator Michael Bennet, Florida Representative Kat Cammack, New Jersey Senator Andy Kim, Oklahoma Representative Stephanie Bice, Oregon Representative Janelle Bynum, and South Dakota Senator John Thune\u2014have requested their pay be withheld during the shutdown. The Senate Financial Clerk and House Chief Administrative Officer confirmed that checks can be held at a member\u2019s request, though the checks are still issued and can be picked up later. The Congressional Budget Office and Congressional Research Service both affirm that congressional pay is mandatory and cannot be legally withheld without specific statutory authority. However, members may voluntarily donate their salaries to the Treasury. In contrast, federal workers, including non-exempt executive branch employees and legislative staff, receive no pay during the shutdown. Exempt workers, such as those in national security or emergency response, continue working. A 2019 law mandates retroactive pay for furloughed and essential employees once funding resumes, but President Donald Trump and administration officials have cast doubt on whether this will be enforced for executive branch workers. The House Committee on Administration confirms that legislative branch employees will receive back pay after the shutdown ends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[Indiana Capital Chronicle](https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/10/27/repub/pay-for-trump-and-congress-continues-in-shutdown-unless-they-ask-it-be-held/)\n\n**No end in sight for government shutdown as key dates approach**\nThe U.S. federal government shutdown entered its 18th day on October 18, 2025, after the Senate failed to pass a temporary funding measure for the 10th time, with Democrats and Republicans refusing to compromise. The shutdown is now the third-longest in U.S. history, surpassed only by a 21-day shutdown in 1995\u20131996 and a 35-day shutdown in 2018\u20132019. Active federal workers missed their first full paychecks on October 18, following partial pay on October 10, affecting an estimated 2 million employees; they are guaranteed back pay under a 2019 federal law. Military personnel are set to be paid on October 31, after President Donald Trump used $8 billion in unused 2025 fiscal year R&D funds to pay 1.2 million service members on October 15\u2014an action questioned by congressional lawmakers. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., plans to vote on paying military and 'excepted' workers next week. House and Senate staff are scheduled to be paid on October 31 and November 1, respectively, but funds are unavailable. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) open enrollment begins November 1, but a House-approved continuing resolution funding the government through November 21 does not extend ACA tax credits or Medicaid eligibility, which expire at year-end. Democrats oppose the resolution, advocating instead for a measure funding the government through October 31 with ACA credit extensions. Republicans prefer to address such issues in the 2026 budget. A critical deadline is November 21, the Friday after Thanksgiving, a major travel weekend; if the shutdown continues, shortages in air traffic controllers and TSA agents could severely disrupt air travel. President Trump has used the shutdown to justify layoffs of federal workers, but U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, appointed by Bill Clinton in 1995, has temporarily blocked the administration from laying off workers represented by two public sector unions and may expand the injunction to three additional unions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:15 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/no-end-sight-government-shutdown-211522498.html)\n\n**Government shutdown Day 17. Trump promotes canceling 'Democrat programs.' Live updates**\nThe U.S. government shutdown entered its 17th day on October 17, 2025, with no resolution in sight. Essential services continue, including military pay for the October 15 payday, though the October 31 paycheck remains uncertain. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), serving 42 million Americans, may not receive full funding for November if the shutdown persists. The U.S. Supreme Court will close its public building to visitors starting October 18 but will continue essential operations such as oral arguments and issuing opinions. The Army Corps of Engineers paused over $11 billion in projects across cities like New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought attributing the halt to Democratic inaction. Federal courts will furlough non-essential staff after October 20, with only safety- and property-protective work continuing without pay. The House of Representatives remains out until at least October 21, with House Majority Whip Steve Scalise stating it will return only if the Senate passes a funding bill. Pentagon workers, including active-duty troops, face missed paychecks on October 31, with House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers warning of severe financial strain and national security risks. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of prioritizing the wealthy, criticizing the administration\u2019s $20 billion bailout for Argentina while refusing to negotiate on health care. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) workers, including ICE and Border Patrol agents, will receive a 'super check' on October 22 covering all hours worked during the shutdown. President Donald Trump, in an interview set to air on Fox News, stated he would permanently cancel 'Democrat programs' and cited the cancellation of the $20 billion Hudson River tunnel project as an example, blaming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer responded that the project's cancellation would harm commuters and the economy. The Senate is scheduled to vote again on October 20 on a House-passed funding bill, needing 60 votes to advance, but only three Democrats have joined Republicans so far. The Senate also failed to pass a full-year Pentagon funding bill, with a 50-44 vote falling short of the 60-vote threshold, leaving military pay for November uncertain.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource:[Great Falls Tribune](https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/17/government-shutdown-trump-congress-day-17-live-updates/86626986007/)\n\n**With funding for courts in question, Congress stuck in shutdown gridlock for day 16**\nThe U.S. government shutdown entered its 16th day on October 17, 2025, with Congress unable to pass a stopgap spending bill, despite repeated attempts. The Senate failed for the 10th time to advance a short-term funding measure, falling short of the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster, with a 51-45 vote. The House, controlled by Republicans, passed a stopgap bill funding the government through November 21, but Senate Democrats blocked it, citing lack of bipartisan input. Federal courts are operating under the Anti-Deficiency Act, using fee balances and other non-appropriated funds through October 17; beyond that, courts will determine staffing based on necessity. The shutdown has led to furloughed federal employees, with essential workers not receiving paychecks and no guarantee of back pay. The Trump administration has continued immigration enforcement actions, citing funds from the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' while the Department of Homeland Security reported that approximately 132,000 essential personnel\u2014such as Customs and Border Protection, TSA, and Secret Service agents\u2014continue working without pay. House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized Senate Democrats, calling the situation a 'political game' and expressing frustration over the lack of pay for Border Patrol agents. Senate Majority Leader John Thune argued that negotiations should begin only after the government is reopened, warning that negotiating during a shutdown would legitimize using shutdowns for political leverage. Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, condemned the Republican strategy, noting that past continuing resolutions were the result of bipartisan negotiation, unlike the current unilateral approach. Schumer warned that tens of millions of Americans will face higher health insurance costs when the Affordable Care Act\u2019s enhanced tax credits expire at year\u2019s end, blaming Republican inaction. The shutdown has also disrupted operations at the National Zoo and Smithsonian museums, which remain closed due to funding lapses. No immediate resolution is in sight, as both sides remain entrenched in ideological and procedural disputes.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 04:45 PM\nSource:[Ohio Capital Journal](https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/10/17/repub/with-funding-for-courts-in-question-congress-stuck-in-shutdown-gridlock-for-day-16/)\n\n**U.S. Government Shutdown Enters Sixth Day Amid Stalemate Over Funding and Potential Mass Layoffs**\nThe U.S. government shutdown entered its sixth day on Monday, October 6, 2025, with no resolution in sight between President Donald Trump's administration and Democratic lawmakers in Congress. Non-essential government services remain suspended, federal paychecks are delayed, and the White House has warned of potential mass layoffs if no agreement is reached. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that contingency plans are being prepared in coordination with the Office of Management and Budget, stating that 'if this shutdown continues, layoffs will be an unfortunate consequence,' though no timeline was provided. President Trump blamed Democrats for the impasse, labeling any layoffs as 'democrat layoffs.' Unlike past shutdowns where employees were temporarily furloughed, the Trump administration signaled a willingness to permanently eliminate federal positions as part of broader efforts to reduce the federal workforce. Republican lawmakers, including moderates like Senators Mike Rounds and Susan Collins, have warned that widespread layoffs could be politically damaging, especially in states with large federal workforces. The Senate was expected to vote on a fifth time for a temporary funding bill to reopen the government until November 21, requiring 60 votes\u2014meaning bipartisan support is necessary. Democrats refused to support the bill unless it included provisions to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies expiring at the end of 2025 and reverse Medicaid cuts from Trump\u2019s second-term spending bill. Republicans argue health issues should be addressed separately after the government reopens. Kevin Hassett, Trump\u2019s chief economic advisor, warned that 'sudden measures' would follow if negotiations fail. Legislative efforts to broker compromise collapsed late last week. House Speaker Mike Johnson refused to reconvene the House until Democrats accept the Senate\u2019s version of the funding bill, drawing criticism from Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who accused Republicans of 'refusing to do their job.' The shutdown has closed departments including Education, Housing, Commerce, and Labor, while essential agencies like Defense, Treasury, and Homeland Security remain partially operational. Without resolution, hundreds of thousands of federal employees may miss paychecks starting October 10, and military personnel could be unpaid starting October 15. A CBS News poll released Sunday showed a narrow majority of Americans blame Republicans for the deadlock, though public frustration is growing across both parties. Democrats warn that without ACA subsidies, 24 million Americans could see their insurance premiums double and 4 million could lose coverage entirely next year. Republicans maintain that subsidies are unrelated to government funding and can be addressed later. This shutdown marks another escalation in Trump\u2019s second term, during which over 200,000 federal jobs have already been cut under the Government Efficiency Department led by Elon Musk. As negotiations remain stalled, markets and workers brace for a prolonged standoff, underscoring deep political divisions in Washington and the mounting economic costs of government paralysis.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 07:00 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/pt/noticias/2025/10/06/paralisacao-do-governo-dos-eua-entra-no-dia-6-aqui-esta-a-situacao/)\n\n**Americans face stalled $3,600 checks amid government shutdown battle**\nThe U.S. federal government entered a partial shutdown on October 1, 2025, after Congress failed to pass funding bills by the midnight deadline, halting non-essential services and delaying critical payments. As a result, federal workers are not being paid, and many government agencies are operating at reduced capacity. While essential services like military operations, VA medical facilities, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, USPS, FEMA, and air traffic control continue to function, numerous administrative processes are delayed. VA benefits for new applicants may be stalled, with monthly payments ranging from $165 to over $3,600. Death benefits such as permanent headstone placements and cemetery maintenance are temporarily paused. The Department of Health and Human Services expects to furlough over 32,000 of its nearly 80,000 employees, affecting CDC and FDA operations. Social Security Administration (SSA) customer service and new application processing may face delays due to furloughs. SNAP benefits will continue, but long-term stability is at risk if the shutdown persists. The House passed a continuing resolution (CR) to extend funding through November 21, 2025, but the Senate failed to advance it due to disagreements over healthcare funding, particularly regarding Obamacare tax credits. The shutdown\u2019s continuation threatens delays in processing new claims, benefits, and administrative tasks across multiple federal agencies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[The US Sun](https://www.the-sun.com/money/15276632/veterans-affairs-disability-stalled-checks-government-shutdown/)\n\n**U.S. Government Shutdown: What It Means and Who Is Affected**\nThe U.S. government shut down on Wednesday, October 1, 2025, marking the first shutdown in six years after the Senate failed to pass a funding bill. The vote ended 55-45, leaving only a slim chance to keep the government open past midnight, with the shutdown officially beginning at 12:01 a.m. The closure is more comprehensive than previous ones because Congress failed to pass any of the 12 appropriations bills funding federal agencies. President Donald Trump threatened to permanently dismiss non-essential federal employees, a departure from the usual practice of temporary furloughs. Essential services such as the military, national security, food inspection, the presidency, and agencies like the Federal Reserve, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and semi-governmental entities (e.g., USPS, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) continued operations. Federal employees were placed on unpaid furloughs, with back pay guaranteed under the 2019 Federal Employees Fair Treatment Act. However, the lack of pay may lead to absenteeism, disrupting services like air travel (FAA) and passport offices. Social Security and healthcare benefits continued, but administrative services like record corrections and new card issuance were delayed. Economic data collection, including the Bureau of Labor Statistics' jobs report and inflation data, was halted, affecting the Federal Reserve and investors. The IRS stopped customer service calls and most tax administration, though tax deadlines remained unchanged. Regulatory agencies like the FTC and SEC ceased most enforcement activities, though the CFTC claimed its market oversight was essential and continued operations. The Federal Reserve and CFPB remained operational, with the latter\u2019s activities reduced under Trump\u2019s administration.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 08:16 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/aswaq/special-stories/2025/10/01/%D8%A7%D8%BA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%88%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AB%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%AA%D9%87)\n\n**America's Shutdown Crisis: Senate Failure, Government Offices May Close, Know Why Outrage Has Erupted**\nThe U.S. Senate adjourned on Tuesday evening without passing a fiscal funding proposal, making a government shutdown nearly certain. With no scheduled session until Wednesday and the midnight deadline for maintaining federal operations missed, non-essential government operations are expected to halt, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees may face temporary pay cuts. Social security and other benefit disbursements could also be affected. President Trump stated that his administration might consider permanently removing some federal employees during the shutdown, though typically non-essential staff are furloughed and receive back pay after the shutdown ends. Under federal law, only 'essential' employees\u2014those involved in life and property protection\u2014will continue working. The Senate failed to pass a temporary funding bill proposed by the Republican Party, which aimed to fund the government until November 21, 2025. After a prolonged debate, the bill was defeated 55-45, falling short of the 60 votes needed for passage in the 100-member Senate, highlighting a major partisan divide between Republicans and Democrats.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 04:52 AM\nSource:[hindi](https://www.abplive.com/news/world/usa-government-shutdown-2025-senate-funding-crisis-trump-obamacare-healthcare-battle-3021533)\n\n**Why the U.S. Government Announced Its Shutdown at Midnight and What It Means**\nThe United States government is heading toward a federal shutdown at midnight on September 30, 2025, marking the start of fiscal year 2026 without a budget agreement approved by Congress. The impasse stems from political deadlock between Republicans and Democrats: the Senate rejected a Republican-proposed temporary funding bill extending funds to November without additional concessions, as well as a Democratic alternative that included protections for healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). President Donald Trump has blamed Democrats for the shutdown, calling it 'probable,' while Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer accused Republicans of weaponizing funding to cut social programs. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has directed federal agencies to activate contingency plans, including temporary or permanent layoffs in non-essential programs, aligned with Trump\u2019s agenda to reduce bureaucracy. This would be the first shutdown since 2019 and the 21st in the past 50 years, intensified by internal party divisions and demands to protect expiring healthcare subsidies. The U.S. federal budget process requires approval of 12 individual appropriation bills or a continuing resolution (CR) to maintain prior-year funding levels\u2014neither has been passed for fiscal year 2026. Despite White House meetings between Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and leaders like Hakeem Jeffries, negotiations failed. Republicans, controlling both chambers, demand a 'clean CR' without political strings, while Democrats insist on linking funding to healthcare protections and reversing previous Medicaid cuts under Trump\u2019s administration. The context is post-election, with Trump seeking to shrink the federal government, inspired by initiatives like 'Project 2025,' and threatening mass layoffs during the shutdown to eliminate 'non-essential' jobs. The OMB issued memos explicitly blaming Democrats, sparking accusations of ethical violations for politicizing official communications. Historically, shutdowns result from similar disputes\u2014such as the 2018\u20132019 shutdown over the border wall\u2014but this one could last longer due to partisan intransigence. A shutdown suspends non-essential federal operations under the Antideficiency Act of 1884, affecting approximately 2 million federal employees, including civilian Defense Department staff, who will be placed on furlough (unpaid leave) or work without guaranteed pay, though they will receive retroactive pay after resolution. Essential services\u2014national security, air traffic control, Social Security, and Medicare\u2014continue, but key economic reports like the monthly jobs report will be canceled, disrupting Federal Reserve decision-making. National parks will close, impacting tourism; the FAA will furlough 11,000 workers, risking flight delays; immigration processing, food inspections, and scientific research will halt, with estimated losses in the billions. Past shutdowns, such as in 2013 and 2018, cost up to $11 billion in productivity and reduced GDP by 0.15\u20130.2 percentage points per week. This shutdown could increase global perceptions of instability in U.S. Treasury bonds, potentially raising interest rates. USCIS will suspend non-urgent immigration processes, affecting visa and asylum applicants. Long-term implications may include damage to the global economy, delayed foreign aid, and weakened international cooperation on climate and trade. Experts warn of a 'data blackout' that hampers monetary policy, with the Fed operating 'in the dark' without labor or inflation indicators. The private sector\u2014airlines and tourism\u2014will suffer losses, and financial markets may become volatile, boosting safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar. Internationally, aid and cooperation could be delayed. However, past shutdowns typically end within days or weeks due to public and economic pressure, with both parties sharing blame. The White House and Congress claim 'zero impunity' in negotiations, but Trump\u2019s threats of further layoffs suggest prolonged uncertainty. The event underscores deep bipartisan dysfunction in Washington, where budgeting is used as a political tool, and highlights the urgent need for budgetary reform to prevent future shutdowns that cost billions and erode public trust.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:27 AM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mexico/2025/10/01/por-que-el-gobierno-de-estados-unidos-anuncio-su-cierre-a-la-media-noche-y-que-significa/)\n\n**Government shutdown live updates, Midnight deadline looms as Senate rejects funding deals**\nThe U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown at midnight on October 1, 2025, after the Senate rejected both a Democratic and a Republican-backed funding plan to extend current spending levels through November 21. The White House, through Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, directed federal agencies to execute shutdown plans, citing that Democrats blocked a clean continuing resolution. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to be furloughed, while essential services\u2014including the U.S. Postal Service, Social Security Administration, military, and Department of Homeland Security\u2014will continue operating. However, non-essential services like the National Park Service, Veterans Affairs (VA) outreach, and student loan support will be disrupted. The VA will close benefits offices, halt GI Bill hotlines, and suspend cemetery maintenance. Student loan borrowers will still make payments, but access to Department of Education support may be limited. Medicare and Medicaid benefits will continue as they are mandatory spending programs. The Trump administration has threatened mass layoffs and program cuts, including potential elimination of Obamacare subsidies and Medicaid expansion for undocumented immigrants, which Democrats oppose. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 10 million people could lose coverage under Republican proposals. Unions have sued the administration over the legality of mass firing threats. NASA\u2019s operations would be severely impacted, with only life- or property-safety-related activities continuing. The longest government shutdown in U.S. history lasted 35 days in 2018\u20132019. A Pew Research Center poll found that 58% of Americans view Trump unfavorably, with congressional leaders also rated negatively. The shutdown is driven by a partisan impasse over health care subsidies, immigration-related Medicaid rules, and federal spending priorities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:54 AM\nSource:[Salina Journal](https://www.salina.com/story/news/politics/2025/09/30/trump-democrats-federal-government-shutdown-live/86440972007/)\n\n**Federal agencies' government shutdown service and staff reduction**\nFederal agencies are preparing for a potential government shutdown on October 1, 2025, following guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Employees are categorized into three groups: furloughed (required to stop work), required to work without pay (excepted employees), or funded separately and continuing with pay. Paychecks for the September 7\u201320 pay period will be issued on time, but those covering work on or after October 1 may be delayed until appropriations are restored. All scheduled paid leave and holidays are canceled for affected staff. Employees may perform up to four hours of 'orderly shutdown' tasks to secure files and equipment. Special workforce cases, such as those in the Deferred Resignation Program or pending reductions-in-force, will be placed in furlough status. The White House, including President Donald Trump, has warned of potential large-scale layoffs if a shutdown occurs, with the Office of Management and Budget directing agencies to prepare both furlough and reduction-in-force notices for programs losing funding and not aligned with presidential priorities. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a shutdown could furlough about 750,000 employees daily at a cost of $400 million per day, with economic losses persisting even after reopening\u2014such as the $3 billion in lost output from the 2018\u20132019 shutdown. Key services that will continue include national defense, military operations, emergency response, border security, air traffic control, medical care at VA facilities, and critical health functions at HHS. Agencies like the Department of Commerce, Education, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Justice, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, Pentagon, NASA, and Social Security Administration have detailed contingency plans. Notably, the IRS remains fully funded, and the VA continues benefits processing and medical care. The Department of War (Pentagon) will maintain military operations despite delayed pay for civilians. The CBO warns that prolonged shutdowns reduce consumer spending, disrupt contractors, and delay investments. Congress and active-duty military continue receiving pay, but federal workers face unpaid work. The White House emphasizes that these preparations are not needed if Congress passes stopgap funding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 10:24 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3831083/government-shutdown-federal-agencies-operate-workers-furloughed/)\n\n",

    "summary": "The forecasts from experts across public administration, legislative affairs, political science, economics, and American studies show a roughly even split on whether the US government shutdown will end before November 21, 2025. Forecasters universally note the shutdown's unprecedented length\u2014currently tied for the longest in US history\u2014and the extreme partisan and procedural deadlock, with a Senate filibuster, a House out of session, and both sides entrenched over ACA subsidies and budgetary demands. Several experts (notably in appropriations, economics, and partisan polarization) put the probability somewhat above even odds (60\u201380%), arguing that mounting social, economic, and political costs\u2014especially missed paychecks, SNAP/WIC benefit losses, and potential chaos during Thanksgiving travel\u2014will likely force a resolution in the final days before the deadline, as has generally happened in shorter past shutdowns. Others (legislative procedure, intergovernmental relations, political science institutionalism, and rational choice) put the probability lower (35\u201345%), contending that the strategic incentives for leadership\u2014especially the Trump administration\u2019s use of the shutdown to pursue permanent government restructuring and layoffs\u2014make this standoff less responsive to typical pressure points. The dichotomy in probabilities (ranging from 35% to 80%, with clustering around 40% and 60\u201368%) reflects a consensus that, while resolution as deadlines approach is probable by historical precedent, the structure of the current impasse (heightened polarization, administration\u2019s willingness to endure pain, procedural obstacles) makes a record-breaking, ultra-long shutdown a very real possibility. All forecasters agree that upcoming pay periods, escalating public hardship, and the approach of Thanksgiving are focal points for a possible deal, but warn that risks of inaction remain unusually high compared to prior episodes.",
