The base rate for use of the Insurrection Act post-1960s is extremely low\u2014used only once, in the 1992 LA riots, and in far more clear-cut situations. Although the administration is preparing for broader military readiness and has established some legal pretext (such as the border national emergency order), there is a measurable gulf between aggressive signaling and formal invocation. Legal setbacks, ambiguous conditions on the ground (no major rebellion or mass unrest), ongoing judicial review, the slow pace of the appellate process, and lack of a triggering black swan event within the next 1.5 months make formal invocation unlikely, though not impossible should a dramatic escalatory event occur or if Trump chooses to force the issue as a precedent-setting power play.

There is no precedent for using the Act for general urban unrest or border security as currently proposed; all recent deployments or threats have encountered legal roadblocks, injunctions, and adverse rulings.

While Trump has deployed troops under other authorities and has signaled intent to invoke the Act, he has yet to do so. Recent developments suggest an increasing gap between rhetoric and formal action: executive orders and Pentagon directive expansion hint at preparation, but bureaucratic and judicial resistance has so far blocked escalatory steps. The narrow time window (1.5 months) for a plausible, catalyzing event is another limiting factor; but risks remain if a major, uncontrollable incident or political shock were to occur. For formal invocation to occur, Trump would need to issue a written order explicitly referencing the Insurrection Act\u2014a move that carries judicial, political, and institutional risks and would likely be rapidly enjoined in court, partially undercutting its utility. Trump's tendency to maximize executive power, the symbolic political stakes, and a lack of effective institutional constraint do somewhat increase the odds above historical base rates.

Key legal hurdles remain: multiple adverse court decisions (including from Trump-appointed judges) have so far blocked National Guard use under existing statutes, with appeals pending but no clear resolution before year\u2019s end. Institutionally, the US military and Pentagon leadership are still deeply wary of being used for explicitly political domestic policing, especially absent an unambiguous national crisis. The historical base rate for formal invocation is extremely low in the absence of catastrophic, nation-shaking disorder; threats, even extreme, tend to fall short of legal invocation, as seen in 2020. However, several factors now point to a heightened\u2014but not overwhelming\u2014risk: (1) Trump\u2019s norm-shattering approach, (2) the masculinized and politicized 'Project 2025' environment, (3) the administration\u2019s willingness to test legal boundaries, (4) the buildup and expansion of military 'quick reaction' forces, and (5) the compressed timeline before the 2026 cutoff. If a catalyzing incident occurs, Trump could issue a formal proclamation, but absent such an event, the line between aggressive posturing and actual invocation may not be crossed. Given the lack of a single clear precipitating event, the strong legal pushback, and traditional civil-military resistance, I assess the probability that Trump will *formally* invoke the Insurrection Act before January 1, 2026 to be serious\u2014but still more likely no than yes, though higher than historical base rates would suggest.",

The decision followed a three-day trial and concluded that President Donald Trump lacked a legal basis for the deployment because he did not establish a rebellion or danger of rebellion, nor did he demonstrate an inability to enforce the law with regular forces. Judge Immergut noted that protests at the Portland ICE building, though nightly between June and October 2025, were largely peaceful after mid-June, with only isolated incidents of violence and minimal interference with federal operations. The administration had claimed the deployment was necessary due to 'war ravaged' conditions and a 'rebellion,' but the judge found these descriptions 'simply untethered to the facts.' The administration criticized the ruling, asserting that President Trump exercised lawful authority to protect federal personnel amid ongoing lawlessness. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield praised the decision as a defense of the rule of law. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had previously ordered a halt to the deployment pending appeal. Two prior orders from Immergut blocked the deployment of Oregon National Guard members and later California troops, which the administration attempted to use to circumvent the first order. Witnesses, including federal security official R.C., testified that they were not consulted about the deployment and did not agree with the administration's characterization of Portland as burning down. City police officials stated they had successfully managed the protests, especially after changing their strategy post-June 14 riot declaration, leading to a decline in crowd size. The ICE building closed for three weeks due to property damage, but ICE operations continued from another location, as testified by regional field office director Cammilla Wamsley. The plaintiffs argued this demonstrated that federal operations were not significantly disrupted.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 05:08 AM\nSource:[The Yeshiva World](https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/2469267/judge-rules-trump-administration-failed-to-meet-legal-requirements-for-deploying-troops-to-portland.html)\n\n**U.S. Federal Judge Rules Trump Lacked Legal Authority to Deploy National Guard to Portland**\nA U.S. federal district court in Oregon ruled that former President Donald Trump lacked legal authority to deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, stating that the administration failed to meet the legal requirements for deploying military forces domestically. The court\u2019s permanent injunction, which extends a prior temporary order, prohibits National Guard deployment to Portland. The ruling stems from a three-day oral argument over whether protests near the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building in Portland between June and October 2025 constituted conditions justifying federal troop deployment under the Insurrection Act. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointed judge, concluded in a 106-page opinion that while the president has broad discretion in such decisions, there was no evidence of rebellion or imminent rioting. She noted that while protests occurred nightly, they were largely peaceful after mid-June, with only sporadic violence and minimal interference with federal officials or immigration enforcement. The Trump administration criticized the decision, with White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson asserting that the president had a legal duty to protect federal personnel and assets amid ongoing violence, and vowed to appeal. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield stated the ruling upholds the rule of law, emphasizing that decisions must be based on facts, not political will. The case may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20251109002753-260408)\n\n**The Militarized Path Toward the Insurrection Act in the United States**\nOn January 20, 2025, shortly after his inauguration, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States. The order directed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to submit, within 90 days, a report on whether additional measures\u2014potentially including invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807\u2014are necessary to achieve 'complete operational control' of the U.S.-Mexico border. The Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy regular military forces and federally activated National Guard when 'obstructions, combinations, or meetings of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the United States' make it 'impracticable' to enforce federal law through ordinary judicial means. Historically, the Act has been invoked around 30 times, but only in extraordinary circumstances such as the Civil War, labor strikes in the 1870s\u20131890s, civil rights enforcement during Reconstruction and the 1960s, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots\u2014the last time it was used. Notably, it has never been used for immigration or border security purposes, making Trump\u2019s proposal a novel and legally questionable precedent. The Pentagon\u2019s assessment, based on official data, cited a sustained decline in illegal crossings, attributing it to strict asylum restrictions and pressure on Latin American governments rather than an actual internal threat. Critics, including military leaders and legal scholars, warn that the invocation of the Insurrection Act for border control represents a 'dangerous slippery slope' and a 'definition of dictatorship and fascism.' Protests erupted in cities including San Diego and Massachusetts in response to new military deployments in Washington D.C., Chicago, and Portland, justified by claims of 'urban anarchy' and rising crime. These deployments have expanded federal authority and weakened state autonomy. Behind the political narrative lies Project 2025, a right-wing initiative seeking to centralize presidential power and restructure the federal government. The intervention is framed not as a public safety measure but as a tool to consolidate executive power and serve interests tied to the military-industrial complex. The administration\u2019s rhetoric targets a broad 'internal enemy' extending across the hemisphere, with particular focus on Venezuela.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 03:25 PM\nSource:[misionverdad.com](https://misionverdad.com/globalistan/el-camino-militarizado-hacia-la-ley-de-insurreccion-en-eeuu)\n\n**What to Expect After Trump Threatens to Send Additional Troops to \u201cWar Ravaged\u201d Portland**\nOn September 27, 2025, former President Donald Trump threatened to send additional troops to Portland, describing the city as 'war ravaged' in a Friday night press conference. The type and number of troops\u2014whether federal agents or the National Guard\u2014remain unspecified. Trump's statement implied that similar deployments could occur in other cities with ICE facilities. Deploying the National Guard to assist ICE agents, as done in Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and planned for Memphis, Tennessee, would likely face legal challenges. Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, a Democrat, stated that state leaders were given 'no information on the reason or purpose of any military mission' and criticized the move. She also claimed that video footage shared by the Oregonian, which she said was 'instigated' by ICE agents, violated the Posse Comitatus Act and the Insurrection Act.

The court\u2019s permanent injunction, which extends a prior temporary order, prohibits National Guard deployment to Portland. The ruling stems from a three-day oral argument over whether protests near the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building in Portland between June and October 2025 constituted conditions justifying federal troop deployment under the Insurrection Act. Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump-appointed judge, concluded in a 106-page opinion that while the president has broad discretion in such decisions, there was no evidence of rebellion or imminent rioting. She noted that while protests occurred nightly, they were largely peaceful after mid-June, with only sporadic violence and minimal interference with federal officials or immigration enforcement. The Trump administration criticized the decision, with White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson asserting that the president had a legal duty to protect federal personnel and assets amid ongoing violence, and vowed to appeal. Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield stated the ruling upholds the rule of law, emphasizing that decisions must be based on facts, not political will. The case may ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20251109002753-260408)\n\n**Trump's National Guard deployment could hinge on how Supreme Court interprets two words**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the phrase 'regular forces' in Title 10, Section 12406 of federal law may determine the outcome of President Donald Trump's attempt to deploy National Guard members to Chicago. The Court has requested additional briefs by November 10, 2025, on whether 'regular forces' refers to active-duty military or civilian law enforcement agencies such as the Federal Protective Service or U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Legal experts, including Georgetown University Law Center professor Martin Lederman, argue that 'regular forces' historically refers to active-duty military personnel, not civilian agencies, and that Trump has not invoked such forces, thus failing a key precondition under the statute. Lederman contends that the term is not 'thorny or complex' and that the absence of a breakdown in state or local law enforcement\u2014such as in Illinois, Oregon, or California\u2014means the legal threshold for federal deployment is unmet. He also notes that even if the Court agrees with his interpretation, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits military involvement in law enforcement, and the Insurrection Act\u2014which would allow military deployment\u2014requires a far higher standard, which current conditions do not meet. The Supreme Court\u2019s delay in issuing a stay suggests it may be effectively denying emergency relief without formally stating so. The split among federal circuit courts\u2014where the 9th Circuit views 'regular forces' as civilian law enforcement, while the 7th Circuit sees it as active military\u2014adds legal uncertainty. Professor Stephen I. Vladeck warns that a ruling in favor of Lederman\u2019s interpretation could block Trump\u2019s deployments nationwide, but also raises the risk of future military intervention if the administration seeks to bypass the current legal framework.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 10:42 PM\nSource:[Oregon Live](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2025/11/trumps-national-guard-deployment-could-hinge-on-how-supreme-court-interprets-two-words.html)\n\n**Judge bars National Guard deployment to Portland until her final ruling**\nU.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut issued a preliminary injunction on November 3, 2025, blocking President Donald Trump from deploying National Guard troops from any state to Portland, Oregon, until she issues a final ruling by the end of the following Friday. The order follows a three-day accelerated trial and extends a prior temporary restraining order that expired at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, November 2, 2025. Judge Immergut ruled that Oregon, California, and Portland are entitled to a preliminary injunction because Trump\u2019s federalization of the National Guard under Title 10, Section 12406 and the Tenth Amendment violated federal law. She found no credible evidence that protests near the Portland ICE facility\u2014located in the South Waterfront neighborhood\u2014had escalated out of control before the federalization order, noting that after a violent night on June 14, 2025, subsequent protests from June 15 to September 27 were 'generally uneventful' with only sporadic unlawful conduct. She concluded that federal, state, and local law enforcement had successfully managed the situation, including making arrests and prosecutions. President Trump had authorized 'all necessary Troops' via a Truth Social post on September 27, 2025, citing threats from 'Antifa and other domestic terrorists' to ICE facilities, and directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to mobilize 200 Oregon National Guard troops for 60 days. When Immergut initially blocked the Oregon deployment on October 4, Hegseth instead deployed 200 California National Guard troops to Portland by air the next day and activated another 200 Texas National Guard troops. Oregon, California, and Portland sued, arguing the federalization violated state sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment and federal statute. The U.S. Department of Justice countered that the court lacked authority to review the president\u2019s determination of a 'danger of rebellion' and that the situation met the criteria under Title 10, Section 12406, citing the June 14 riot and violent targeting of federal personnel. They argued that a permanent injunction would be 'drastic and extraordinary' and requested it be limited to the specific deployment order, not future actions if conditions change. The judge\u2019s final decision will determine whether the deployment remains blocked.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[Oregon Live](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2025/11/judge-bars-national-guard-deployment-to-portland-until-her-final-ruling.html)\n\n**Pentagon sets January 1 deadline to set up National Guard \"riot control\" units**\nThe Pentagon has issued an internal memo setting a January 1, 2026, deadline for establishing 'quick reaction' National Guard units\u2014approximately 500 soldiers per state\u2014in all 50 states and four U.S. territories, totaling 23,500 personnel. These units are intended to be deployable within 24 hours to suppress civil unrest, following an executive order by President Trump after the 2024 occupation of Washington D.C. by National Guard and federal agents. The memo, cited by the Washington Post, mandates training in civil disturbance operations, including the use of non-lethal weapons like batons, tasers, and teargas launchers, with each unit to receive 100 sets of crowd control equipment. The National Guard Bureau will deploy trainers to every state, requiring monthly progress reports via a defense readiness system. Trump has asserted absolute authority over domestic military deployments, claiming he could send the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines without judicial review, invoking the Insurrection Act. Federal court rulings have blocked deployments in Chicago and Portland, with the Supreme Court requesting additional briefs on the Chicago case and the Ninth Circuit reviewing the Portland appeal. The California Department of Justice criticized the administration\u2019s broad definition of 'rebellion' as including resistance to authority, calling it legally implausible. In Portland, the DOJ admitted to errors in its account, including overstating the number of federal officers deployed. The Seventh Circuit previously deemed federal declarations in Chicago unreliable due to omissions and contradictions. In Chicago, Democratic candidate Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old Palestinian-American, was indicted on federal charges of conspiracy to impede an ICE officer and assault, which she calls 'political persecution' and claims is retaliation for protesting immigration raids.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 03:08 AM\nSource:[World Socialist](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2025/10/31/pjmq-o31.html)\n\n**Pentagon readying thousands of Guard \u2018reaction forces\u2019 as U.S. mission widens | Military | unionleader.com**\nThe Pentagon is preparing a new 'quick reaction force' within the National Guard, consisting of 23,500 personnel across all 50 states and three territories (excluding D.C.), to be trained and equipped for civil unrest response by January 1, 2026. The force, drawn primarily from personnel trained in disaster response\u2014including nuclear, chemical, biological, and radiological incidents\u2014will be ready to deploy within eight hours, with full operational capability in one day. The initial 200 troops will come from the Chemical Biological Radiological Nuclear Assistance Support Element, with training including riot-control tactics, use of Tasers and pepper spray, and each unit required to carry 100 sets of crowd-control gear. This initiative, announced in August 2025, expands the existing National Guard Reaction Force, which has operated for about two decades but is now being restructured for broader domestic deployment. The move reflects President Donald Trump\u2019s broader effort to deploy military forces into urban centers, including D.C., Los Angeles, Memphis, and potentially Chicago and Portland, Oregon\u2014though the latter deployments have been delayed by court rulings. Trump has asserted broad authority to deploy active-duty troops domestically, claiming such actions are necessary to 'have safe cities,' despite legal restrictions on military law enforcement roles except under the Insurrection Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has requested additional briefs on the Chicago deployment dispute, pushing a decision to mid-November 2025. Critics, including Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, warn that federalizing the National Guard and expanding domestic military roles undermines constitutional checks and balances, erodes the military\u2019s core mission, and risks institutional decay due to Congress\u2019s lack of oversight.

This statement, made amid heightened tensions over the federal deployment of the National Guard in cities like Chicago\u2014where protests against immigration enforcement policies have led to violent crackdowns, including tear-gassing residential neighborhoods and arresting elderly individuals\u2014sparked widespread condemnation. Critics, including veteran and political analyst Evaristus Odinikaeze, labeled the remarks a 'dictator fantasy,' emphasizing that the Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of federal military forces for domestic law enforcement, and that the courts and constitutional limits would intervene. Trump\u2019s comments followed other controversial assertions this month, including claims that he could unilaterally authorize lethal force against suspected drug smugglers, position himself as the nation\u2019s 'chief lawmaker,' and demolish federal monuments like the Jefferson Memorial without legal authority. Despite these claims, the Insurrection Act has not yet been invoked by Trump, and the administration maintains that National Guard deployment is necessary due to alleged failures by local police to address 'mob violence.' Illinois State Senator Graciela Guzman reported that tear gas has been used in routine public settings, including near churches, schools, and emergency rooms, over the past two weeks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:21 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-goes-full-dictator-with-bonkers-threat-to-use-air-force-and-navy-in-us-cities/)\n\n**Federal trial over Trump's National Guard deployment in Portland begins**\nA federal trial began in Portland, Oregon, on October 29, 2025, over whether President Donald Trump had the legal authority to deploy the National Guard to the city. U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, presides over the case, which stems from a lawsuit filed by the city and state of Oregon to block the deployment. Immergut previously issued two temporary restraining orders, ruling that Trump failed to meet Congress\u2019s conditions for domestic military use, including proving a 'rebellion' or 'danger of rebellion'\u2014a characterization she called 'simply untethered to the facts.' One of her orders was initially paused by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals but was later vacated, with the case to be reheard by an 11-judge panel. The city and state argue that federal agents have used excessive force, including tear gas and pepper balls on small, nonviolent groups, without provocation or de-escalation. They cite incidents where Portland Police Bureau (PPB) officers were gassed or struck by crowd-control projectiles and describe federal agents as operating without clear command structure. The administration counters that the PPB has been unhelpful or hostile, and that federal forces are needed because local law enforcement cannot maintain order. The state and city also claim federal agents have disrupted lawful protests, violating First Amendment rights. Similar tensions have emerged in Chicago, where federal agents have also deployed tear gas against demonstrators. The trial, expected to last three days, features testimony from officials across ICE, the Department of Defense, and the Federal Protective Service. The case is a key test of presidential power over state sovereignty and the legal limits of domestic military deployment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 04:40 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/portland-oregon-troops-deploy-trump-immergut-b55f63e2139afc334ae1958d78811875)\n\n**'More than the National Guard.' Trump warns of more troops in US cities**\nOn October 28, 2025, former President Donald Trump warned during a trip to Japan that he would send 'more than the National Guard' to 'troubled' U.S. cities to ensure public safety, signaling a potential escalation beyond current deployments. Trump has previously deployed the National Guard to cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, and Memphis to manage protests related to stricter immigration enforcement. However, mayors and governors in all but Memphis have opposed these deployments, leading to legal challenges with mixed outcomes. Federal courts have blocked some deployments\u2014such as the temporary injunction in Chicago\u2014prompting Trump to threaten invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act, which would allow active-duty military forces to be deployed for domestic law enforcement. The Justice Department cited statements from Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Russell Hott and Border Patrol official Daniel Parra to justify the need for National Guard presence, claiming dangerous conditions. However, U.S. District Judge April Perry ruled the sources were unreliable, stating their statements demonstrated 'a potential lack of candor' and called into question their factual accuracy\u2014an assessment upheld by the appeals court. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the temporary block in Chicago at any time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:56 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/more-national-guard-trump-warns-125623561.html)\n\n**The Militarized Path Toward the Insurrection Act in the United States**\nOn January 20, 2025, shortly after his inauguration, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring a national emergency at the southern border of the United States. The order directed the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security to submit, within 90 days, a report on whether additional measures\u2014potentially including invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807\u2014are necessary to achieve 'complete operational control' of the U.S.-Mexico border. The Insurrection Act allows the president to deploy regular military forces and federally activated National Guard when 'obstructions, combinations, or meetings of persons, or rebellion against the authority of the United States' make it 'impracticable' to enforce federal law through ordinary judicial means. Historically, the Act has been invoked around 30 times, but only in extraordinary circumstances such as the Civil War, labor strikes in the 1870s\u20131890s, civil rights enforcement during Reconstruction and the 1960s, and the 1992 Los Angeles riots\u2014the last time it was used. Notably, it has never been used for immigration or border security purposes, making Trump\u2019s proposal a novel and legally questionable precedent. The Pentagon\u2019s assessment, based on official data, cited a sustained decline in illegal crossings, attributing it to strict asylum restrictions and pressure on Latin American governments rather than an actual internal threat. Critics, including military leaders and legal scholars, warn that the invocation of the Insurrection Act for border control represents a 'dangerous slippery slope' and a 'definition of dictatorship and fascism.' Protests erupted in cities including San Diego and Massachusetts in response to new military deployments in Washington D.C., Chicago, and Portland, justified by claims of 'urban anarchy' and rising crime. These deployments have expanded federal authority and weakened state autonomy. Behind the political narrative lies Project 2025, a right-wing initiative seeking to centralize presidential power and restructure the federal government. The intervention is framed not as a public safety measure but as a tool to consolidate executive power and serve interests tied to the military-industrial complex. The administration\u2019s rhetoric targets a broad 'internal enemy' extending across the hemisphere, with particular focus on Venezuela.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 09, 2025 03:25 PM\nSource:[misionverdad.com](https://misionverdad.com/globalistan/el-camino-militarizado-hacia-la-ley-de-insurreccion-en-eeuu)\n\n**Trump floats invoking Insurrection Act**\nWhite House officials have engaged in increasingly serious discussions about President Trump potentially invoking the Insurrection Act, a rarely used 19th-century law that grants the president authority to deploy active-duty military personnel within the United States for law enforcement purposes.

The law, which has not been invoked in recent decades, allows the president to deploy troops domestically under specific conditions, such as to suppress insurrection or enforce federal law when state authorities are unable or unwilling to do so.

What It Means**\nUS President Donald Trump stated on October 8, 2025, that he might invoke the Insurrection Act\u2014a centuries-old federal law enabling the president to deploy military forces or federalize the National Guard within the United States to suppress domestic insurrections\u2014should courts or governors continue blocking his deployment of National Guard troops in Democratic-led cities. The Insurrection Act, rooted in statutes from 1792 to 1871 and formally signed into law in 1807 by President Thomas Jefferson, authorizes military involvement in domestic law enforcement, including arrests and searches, which are otherwise prohibited under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. The law applies when there are 'unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion' against federal authority. Trump previously relied on Section 12406 of Title 10 of the US Code to deploy National Guard troops during the summer of 2025, which prohibits law enforcement activities but allows protection of federal personnel and property. The Insurrection Act has been invoked dozens of times historically, most recently in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots following the Rodney King verdict. It has become exceedingly rare since the 1960s. While the president can deploy troops without a governor\u2019s approval under certain conditions, courts have generally shown deference to presidential military decisions\u2014though legal experts argue judicial review is still possible. An Oregon federal judge recently ruled against Trump\u2019s use of Section 12406 in Portland, asserting that 'a great level of deference' does not equate to ignoring factual circumstances. Trump has previously considered using the Insurrection Act during the 2020 protests following George Floyd\u2019s death but did not act.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:02 AM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/president-donald-trump-warns-we-have-an-insurrection-act-for-a-reason-what-it-means-9415949)\n\n**The Insurrection Act: Trump's Threat to Deploy Troops Amid Rising Protests**\nDonald Trump has recently threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a federal law that grants the U.S. president the authority to deploy military forces within the country to quell civil unrest. Originally enacted in 1807 and amended between 1792 and 1871, the law allows the president to use the Armed Forces to 'restore order' when civilian authorities are unable to do so. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan New York-based institute, the law represents one of the broadest and most vaguely defined emergency powers in the U.S. system. The law suspends the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which normally prohibits the military from performing law enforcement duties. However, the Insurrection Act lacks a clear definition of what constitutes an 'insurrection,' leaving significant discretion to the president. The law applies in three scenarios: at the request of a state government, by presidential decision if enforcing laws is impracticable through normal means, or to protect constitutional rights when state authorities 'cannot or will not' act. Legal scholars warn that the vague language grants near-unlimited power to the executive branch. The last invocation occurred in 1992, when President George H. W. Bush deployed federal troops to California after the Los Angeles riots following the acquittal of police officers in the Rodney King beating. Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy previously used the law to enforce school desegregation after the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. The White House has not provided an official justification for potential use. Trump has stated he might invoke the law if governors or courts 'obstruct' his deployment orders. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Protect Democracy have warned that such a move could be 'dangerous' and undermine democratic checks on presidential power.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 04:25 AM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/a-fondo/567806-ley-insurreccion-poder-extremo-trump-protestas)\n\n**Trump Threatens to Invoke Centuries-Old 'Insurrection Act' for Military Deployment in U.S. Cities**\nU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a centuries-old law granting the president emergency powers to deploy military forces within the U.S. to maintain order, particularly in cases of domestic unrest. The Washington Post reports the law, originally signed by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, allows the president to deploy troops to enforce federal law or suppress rebellion, either upon request from a state legislature or governor, or unilaterally if the president deems civil disobedience, illegal assembly, or insurrection has made law enforcement ineffective. A 1956 amendment expanded the president\u2019s unilateral authority. Trump has invoked the law in rhetoric during protests over George Floyd\u2019s death in 2020 and after immigration raids in Los Angeles in June 2025, stating it is 'necessary' even if not yet used. His administration claims military deployment is needed to protect U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, while Democratic officials accuse Trump of politicizing the threat to target cities they oppose. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, the law permits three deployment methods: state request, unilateral presidential action, or intervention when constitutional rights are threatened. The center notes the law\u2019s vague language grants nearly unchecked discretion to the president. The law has been invoked over 30 times in U.S. history, most recently in 1992 when President George H.W.

The Washington Post describes the law as one of the White House\u2019s most powerful emergency powers, allowing the president to deploy troops to suppress domestic unrest, typically in extreme circumstances. Originally signed by Thomas Jefferson in 1807, the law permits the president to send federal troops to a state upon request by the state legislature or governor during an uprising. A 1956 amendment expanded presidential authority, allowing unilateral deployment when the president deems illegal actions or rebellion have made law enforcement impossible. Trump has referenced the law during both his first and second presidential terms\u2014threatening to deploy the military during the George Floyd protests in 2020 and again in June 2025 after anti-immigration raids sparked protests in Los Angeles. He stated the law exists 'for a reason' and described it as a way to 'bypass' opposition to military deployment. The Brennan Center for Justice outlines three ways the law can be invoked: (1) at the request of a state governor or legislature; (2) unilaterally by the president without state consent; and (3) to counter actions that threaten constitutional rights or obstruct justice.

Legal experts, including Professor Thomas Gift from University College London, note the law's vague language grants the president broad discretion, with minimal legal constraints, making it difficult to challenge a presidential decision to invoke it. The law requires a formal presidential proclamation, and while state leaders may resist, the president holds near-total authority under current interpretation.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 02:00 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/10511/9056484)\n\n**Explainer-Trump keeps bringing up the Insurrection Act. What is it?**\nU.S. President Donald Trump stated on October 7, 2025, that he might invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces in Democratic-led cities if courts and governors block his use of National Guard troops. The Insurrection Act, originally enacted in 1807 but consolidated from statutes between 1792 and 1871, grants the president authority to deploy the military or federalize the National Guard to suppress domestic rebellions, unlawful assemblies, or insurrections. It allows military personnel to conduct arrests and searches\u2014activities generally prohibited under the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. Trump previously relied on Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code to deploy National Guard troops this summer, which prohibits them from performing civilian law enforcement. The Insurrection Act has been used dozens of times historically, most recently in 1992 during the Los Angeles riots after the Rodney King verdict. While courts have traditionally shown 'great deference' to presidential military decisions, a federal judge in Oregon recently ruled against Trump\u2019s use of Section 12406 in Portland, stating that deference does not equate to ignoring factual circumstances. The law permits presidential deployment without gubernatorial approval in certain cases, though governors have typically consented in past instances. Legal experts warn the Insurrection Act risks undermining civil liberties and democratic norms, as the founding fathers feared military overreach in domestic affairs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:02 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/explainer-trump-keeps-bringing-insurrection-180237007.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across nine expert perspectives\u2014including US National Security, Military Legal Advisory, Crisis Management, Political Science (Executive Power Theory and Crisis Government Models), Constitutional Law (War Powers and Separation of Powers), and American Studies (Civil-Military Relations)\u2014forecasts converge on a similar qualitative diagnosis: The probability that President Trump will formally invoke the Insurrection Act before January 1, 2026 remains low, though elevated compared to historic norms.\n\nKey common reasons for a low probability include:\n- A very high legal and historical threshold for formal invocation, with the Insurrection Act not used since 1992 and never for the circumstances currently at play (urban unrest, immigration, or ordinary protest/control failures).\n- Multiple federal court rulings\u2014even from Trump-appointed judges\u2014have blocked or enjoined recent domestic military deployments, determined the statutory criteria for invocation have not been met, and signaled judicial scrutiny remains high. Legal barriers are multi-layered, with ongoing litigation making rapid invocation difficult.\n- Military and bureaucratic resistance is pronounced; Pentagon and National Guard leaders, as well as DOJ officials, have demonstrated reluctance to engage in potentially unlawful or broadly politicized domestic deployments, especially in the absence of catastrophic disorder.\n- Public and political backlash, as well as lack of Congressional or bipartisan consensus, raises the political cost of invocation.\n\nFactors raising (though not outweighing) the probability include:\n- Trump's demonstrated willingness to threaten and rhetorically inch toward formal invocation, willingness to break norms, and executive signaling aimed at projecting strength or overriding legal blockages.\n- The existence of a compressed timeline, which may marginally increase the likelihood of 'Hail Mary' or last-ditch actions (especially if a catalyzing event occurs).\n- The persistent risk of a triggering black swan event (sudden mass violence, uncontrollable breakdown, or a court defeat for Trump) that could create conditions under which invocation is deemed necessary and executed quickly.\n\nScenarios for 'No' involve continued judicial, military, and state-level resistance, legal stalling, and absence of a triggering crisis. Scenarios for 'Yes' require a highly visible, large-scale crisis, combined with political will to override judicial and institutional obstacles, and explicit, formal legal action.\n\nMost forecasts place the probability between 10%\u201315% (National Security, Military Legal, Crisis Management, PolSci Crisis, Law War Powers, Law Separation), with somewhat higher estimates (22% for PolSci Executive Power, 27% for Civil-Military Relations) factoring in Trump\u2019s aggressive rhetorical behavior and executive incentives. The consensus remains that, barring a rapid and major escalation, a formal invocation is 'not impossible, but unlikely.'",
