However, the confluence of Trump\u2019s agitation, a well-advanced transition process, and the unique volatility of the 2025-26 period does inject some non-zero risk\u2014above the base rate for a typical Fed Chair. Historically, the probability a Fed Chair departs before their term ends is extremely low absent scandal or illness; factoring slight increases for today\u2019s unusual political posturing, I estimate a risk in the single digits.

Historically, Fed Chair early departures are virtually unheard of in the absence of health/scandal. While the news flow references intense political jockeying and names five finalists, there is no concrete evidence (yet) that Powell will be displaced before the end of 2025.

While the rapidly advancing shortlist and clear intention to influence Fed policy suggest elevated tensions and political urgency, the appointment/confirmation timeline, as reported, aligns with a May 2026 transition\u2014not January 2026 or earlier. Despite some increase in short-term uncertainty given the aggressive public timeline and ongoing legal case against agency independence, the overwhelming evidence from U.S. political institutions, public statements, and news coverage is that Powell will remain as Chair through at least January 1, 2026. My institutionalist view thus strongly supports a 'No' outcome, with only modestly heightened tail risk relative to most peacetime transitions.",

The legal hurdles are considerable and the Supreme Court has recently reaffirmed the insulation of Fed leadership from capricious removal, although a pending case (re: Lisa Cook) bears watching and could marginally raise risk if precedent shifts. The probability that Powell is pressured into resigning due to politics, scandal, or health appears exceedingly low with no evidence in public reporting. The slightly increased media attention and accelerated vetting could, in principle, nudge the odds up, but with no fresh crisis, no market blowup, and no extraordinary event or resignation pattern in Powell\u2019s statements, there is no strong catalyst at present.

All the hardball politicking and early shortlists in the world don't add up to a credible threat to Powell's tenure before 2026 unless those at the commanding heights\u2014Congress, markets, the legal elite\u2014sign off. As the elite theorist points out, the reputational cost and market chaos from an early ouster are simply not in the interest of anyone who matters, especially with only weeks to go before the question resolves. Trump's incentives, for all his tough talk, are to avoid triggering a legitimacy crisis right when he wants policy stability pre-election. The probability here is a small tail risk for a true black swan only. Anything higher would be ignoring the chilling effect of elite coordination on even the most hyperactive presidential maneuvers. Five percent is justified, and central banker nostalgia is actually the wisdom of elite inertia."

This is precisely what elite theory would highlight: when an outsider president with a taste for norm-busting is methodically marshaling the levers of power and market communications to create a sense of inevitability, the stolid guardrails of institutional independence wobble, even if only at the margins. The forecast also wisely points to realistic tail risks\u2014health, scandal, or the kind of coordinated elite coup (however improbable) that can never be totally priced out in a turbulent period like late 2025.

And while legal removal is a brick wall, voluntary or face-saving resignation is a crack that constant, high-stakes politicking can exploit.

Your slight uptick from base rates is actually a mark of disciplined forecasting\u2014not being a prisoner of the past, but adapting to the high-pressure realities of 2025.

The historical base rate for pre-term Fed exits is almost zero, but never before has a Chair faced such open, prolonged, and institutionally sophisticated pressure.

While my defense of the elite theory perspective was strong, the US Public Administration forecasters are right that this is not simply a 'normal' transition: Trumpism and modern hyper-partisan strategies do introduce plausible new tail risks. Base rates remain highly constraining, but not quite as absolute as a 2\u20133% forecast suggests in this context.

The critiques of extremely low probability forecasts (2-3%) are persuasive\u2014this materially is not a 'pure' institutional status quo. By elite theory logic, while true coordinated ouster remains very unlikely due to elite disincentives and institutional inertia, the probability of a voluntary resignation (for reasons of reputational saving, exhaustion, or unforeseen personal considerations under exceptional circumstances) merits a slight upward adjustment.

However, defenders of the ultra-low probabilities compellingly argue that absent health issues, scandal, or a massive, institution-shattering move, Powell stepping down before 2026 remains highly improbable, with elite consensus, market stability, and legal barriers all acting as powerful constraints. Meanwhile, my own forecast (6%) resides just above the consensus midpoint, reflecting a modest tail risk above base rate but below the threshold of significant likelihood.

This isn't merely 'background noise'; it elevates the risk of voluntary resignation, especially if Powell judges that staying imperils the institution or personally becomes untenable.

Even in the absence of a viable legal removal mechanism, Powell could calculate that stepping aside avoids further institutional damage or market confusion, especially amidst a concerted campaign to undermine his authority.

However, no actual evidence points to an imminent health, scandal, or formal removal path, and most reporting and behaviors from Trump/Bessent still suggest intention to stick to May 2026.

Erste Group analyst Maurice Jiszda stated that Bessent plans to conduct a second round of interviews with these candidates this month before presenting a narrowed list to the president ahead of Thanksgiving. Trump may announce his choice before year-end, a faster timeline than usual, which could allow the incoming chair to influence investor expectations on future interest rate trajectories. However, this early appointment could create tension with current policymakers, potentially placing the successor in the uncomfortable position of publicly challenging future colleagues.

Yardeni praised Powell for navigating a series of 'unprecedented challenges,' including the pandemic, inflation shock, and political pressure to cut interest rates, calling his performance 'very good' given the circumstances. However, Yardeni warned that a Trump-aligned successor could pursue a more dovish monetary policy, potentially facing opposition from other Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. He cautioned that if the new chair were overruled in a vote, the resulting internal division would be unprecedented and could severely damage the Fed's credibility. Yardeni also warned that if a Trump-leaning chair cuts rates without supporting economic data, 'bond vigilantes'\u2014a term for investors who react aggressively to perceived fiscal irresponsibility\u2014could push bond yields higher, as they did in late 2023. He noted that the Fed is currently operating 'in the fog' during the ongoing government shutdown, relying on private-sector data to guide decisions. Yardeni interpreted Powell's latest comments as suggesting a possible pause in rate cuts at the December meeting. While acknowledging Powell has served 'in the best interests of the American people,' Yardeni concluded that his successor may steer the Fed toward greater political influence, thereby testing its independence and public trust.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/economy-news/article-1305730)\n\n**U.S. Federal Reserve Leadership Race Narrows Amid Rising Political and Economic Tensions**\nThe United States is approaching a critical moment in its monetary policy as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2024. With the Trump administration already narrowing the list of candidates to succeed Powell, the selection process has become a high-stakes political and economic battle. According to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the candidate pool has been reduced to five individuals: current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Bessent stated he has conducted interviews and expects to present a 'strong list' to Trump after Thanksgiving. President Donald Trump confirmed he expects to name a successor by the end of the year. Powell\u2019s current term ends in May 2024, and he may either step down entirely or remain as Chair until 2028. Trump currently has three appointed members on the seven-member Board of Governors: Waller, Bowman, and Stephen Moore, whose term ends in January. Moore is expected to be confirmed as Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. If Powell departs, Trump would appoint four new members. Trump has so far failed to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Five regional Fed presidents join the Board in voting on the Federal Open Market Committee. Financial expert Mohamed Saeed noted to 'Economy Sky News Arabia' that the selection will have significant implications for U.S. fiscal policy, inflation risks, and the future of public debt.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 12:50 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0629](http://akhbarak.net/news/details/48089811/23/%D8%B3%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%82-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%B9)\n\n**The Race to Succeed Jerome Powell: A Political and Economic Battle for the Fed's Future**\nThe United States is approaching a critical moment in its monetary policy as Jerome Powell's term as Chair of the Federal Reserve ends in May 2026. With the presidential administration under Donald Trump already advancing the selection process for his successor, the race has transformed from a technical appointment into a high-stakes political and economic battle. The list of candidates has been narrowed to five by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman (current Federal Reserve Governors), Kevin Hassett (White House Economic Council Director), Kevin Warsh (former Fed Governor), and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Trump has indicated he expects to name a successor by year-end, despite Bessent stating he is not pursuing the role himself. The appointment process is significant because of concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve, especially given Trump\u2019s past criticisms of Powell and his push for faster interest rate cuts. Experts, including financial analyst Mohamed Saeed and global markets head Joe Yarq, warn that political interference could undermine market credibility, increase inflation risks, and trigger financial instability. However, with inflation near the Fed\u2019s 2% target, the new chair may face a more stable environment. Trump has also reportedly considered Bessent for the role, though Bessent has downplayed the possibility. The outcome will shape the balance between monetary independence and political influence in the U.S. economy.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1830242-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%84%D9%81-%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%94%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%9F)\n\n**Fed Chair Shortlist Finalized: Five Candidates in Race, Trump Pushes for New Nominee**\nOn October 28, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was 'ineffective' and announced that a new chair would be appointed when Powell's term ends in May 2026. Trump previously called for Powell's resignation and demanded a 300-basis-point rate cut, though the Fed is widely expected to cut rates by 25 basis points at its October 29 meeting\u2014marking the second consecutive rate reduction. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent revealed that the shortlist for the Fed chair has been narrowed to five candidates: Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both current Federal Reserve Board members; Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; Kevin Hassett, White House National Economic Council Director; and Rick Rieder, a BlackRock executive. Bessent plans to conduct interviews and submit a 'high-quality candidate list' to Trump by late November. Trump indicated he expects to finalize the nominee before the end of 2025. Analysts note that Trump\u2019s urgency may stem from the fact that although Powell\u2019s chairmanship ends in May 2026, he could remain on the Fed Board until January 2028, limiting Trump\u2019s ability to appoint a new board member in the interim.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 12:33 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/news/13004177/20251029/48945461.html)\n\n**5 Finalists Named for New Fed Chair; Trump to Decide by End of 2025**\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed the list of five candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026.

Bessent, leading the search, plans to conduct second-round interviews in the coming weeks and provide President Donald Trump with a 'good state' of candidates, likely after Thanksgiving, with Trump expected to make a final selection by the end of 2025. Bessent has criticized the Federal Reserve for continuing unconventional policies, including Treasury bond purchases to lower long-term interest rates, and called for an 'honest, independent, and nonpartisan review' of the institution. His remarks come amid Trump\u2019s frequent criticism of Powell, whom he accused of slow rate cuts, stating, 'He should have been much lower, much sooner.' Trump also attempted to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee, to create a vacancy. The Fed is expected to cut its key rate again on Wednesday, marking the second cut of the year.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the second round of screening is underway and expressed hope to present a strong shortlist to the president shortly after Thanksgiving (November 27, 2024). The White House previously revealed 11 candidates in August, with Kevin Hassett, Chair of the National Economic Council (NEC), Christopher Waller, a Federal Reserve Board member, and Kevin Warsh, a former Fed board member, emerging as the most prominent contenders. Trump has consistently criticized Powell throughout 2024, calling him a 'stubborn fool,' 'dummy,' and 'disaster' on social media, accusing him of being overly cautious in lowering interest rates. This sustained pressure is widely interpreted as part of a strategic effort to diminish Powell\u2019s influence and install a more compliant Fed leadership. Trump has already advanced his 'pro-Trump' faction by appointing Stephen Meyer, Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), to replace Democratic appointee Adriana Kugler, who resigned in August. Current Fed board members Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, both appointed during Trump\u2019s first term, have publicly supported rate cuts in alignment with Trump\u2019s stance since July. Additionally, Trump notified Lisa Cook, another Fed board member, of her dismissal in late August; although a lawsuit is ongoing and she remains in office, the possibility of her removal by the U.S. Supreme Court would further strengthen the pro-Trump majority on the board.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 08:10 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uad6d\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/A2025102715450005876)\n\n**UPDATE 1-Bessent says he plans to present Fed chief candidates to Trump in December | Law-Order**\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on October 15, 2025, at a CNBC event during the IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington that he plans to present three to four candidates to President Donald Trump for the next Federal Reserve chair position after the Thanksgiving holiday in late November. Bessent narrowed the list from 11 to five finalists to succeed Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May 2026. The selection process, which may extend into 2026 due to the need for Senate confirmation, is closely watched globally as it could allow Trump to influence the Fed\u2019s independence. Bessent noted the process would likely resume after Trump\u2019s Asia trip, with candidate interviews expected in December. When asked about Trump\u2019s demand for lower interest rates, Bessent stated that 'one of the criteria is to have an open mind.' Trump has previously criticized Powell and attempted to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook over unproven allegations, a case now before the Supreme Court. Among the five finalists are two current Fed board members appointed by Trump: Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman and Governor Christopher Waller. The other three are National Economic Council Chair Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock\u2019s Rick Rieder. Choosing a non-board member would require a vacant seat, with Miran\u2019s seat expiring in January 2026. Powell has not confirmed whether he will remain on the board after stepping down as chair, though his term extends to January 31, 2028.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 06:07 PM\nSource:[Devdiscourse](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/3664816-update-1-bessent-says-he-plans-to-present-fed-chief-candidates-to-trump-in-december)\n\n**11 Candidates Vie for Next Fed Chair as Treasury Secretary Blumenthal Begins Interviews**\nThe article reports that the Federal Reserve Chair, Jerome\u202fPowell, will finish his term in May 2025, and former President Trump is preparing to select a successor. Treasury Secretary\u202fBlumenthal is leading the selection process, beginning interviews with candidates on Friday of the current week. According to sources, Trump has a shortlist of 11 potential chairs, including Fed Governors Christopher\u202fWaller and Michelle\u202fBowman, National Economic Council Chair Kevin\u202fHassett, and former Governor Kevin\u202fWarsh. The Fed Chair is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate; candidates come from the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors and serve four\u2011year terms, renewable once. Powell was appointed to the Board in 2012 by President Obama, named Chair in 2017 by Trump, and reappointed by President Biden in 2021 for a term ending May\u202f2026. The Fed Chair holds the most influential central\u2011bank position worldwide, directing U.S. monetary policy, voting on interest\u2011rate decisions, and managing the Fed\u2019s large balance sheet.

What to know about Fed chair Trump calls 'too stupid'**\nDespite President Donald Trump's criticism, the Federal Reserve, led by Chair Jerome Powell, maintained its key interest rate, defying pressure from Trump to lower it. Trump has repeatedly called for Powell's removal, labeling him 'TOO LATE, TOO ANGRY, TOO STUPID, & TOO POLITICAL.' However, legally, Trump cannot fire Powell, as Fed governors are only removable 'for cause,' as determined by law. Powell's term as chairman is set to end in May 2026. A Supreme Court case, taken by Trump, could potentially alter the landscape of independent agency leadership, but Powell believes the Fed would be exempt. Trump nominated Powell as chair during his first administration and reappointed him for a four-year term in 2022 under the Biden administration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 31, 2025 02:57 PM\nSource:[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/07/31/trump-fire-jerome-powell-fed/85402766007/)\n\n**Leading contenders to replace Jerome Powell as Fed chair**\nAccording to a leading bookmaker, Kevin Warsh is the favorite to replace Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve if President Donald Trump appoints a successor before the end of 2025. Warsh, who served on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 2006 to 2011, has been offered odds of 2/1 (33.3 percent) by Star Sports. Trump has been critical of Powell, whom he appointed, over his refusal to slash interest rates, and has called for lower rates to kick-start the economy. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the second favorite, with 9/4 (30.8 percent) odds, followed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chris Waller. Trump has spent months calling for Powell to lower interest rates, and has described him as a 'numbskull' and 'one of my worst appointments.' It remains to be seen whether Trump will fire Powell this year or wait until his term ends in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 19, 2025 03:18 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/leading-contenders-replace-jerome-powell-fed-chair-2101184)\n\n**Trump Says He Won't Fire Powell, But Doesn't Rule Out Possibility**\nUS President Donald Trump stated on July 16 that he does not plan to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, but he has not ruled out such a possibility and has renewed his criticism of the central bank chief for not lowering interest rates. According to Reuters, Trump said, 'I'm not saying it's going to happen, but I'm not saying it's not going to happen either. If he has to leave because of corruption, then maybe it will happen.' Trump has been almost daily criticizing Powell for 'being too late' to lower interest rates. However, Trump confirmed that he had discussed the idea of firing Powell with Republican lawmakers on Tuesday evening, which is the latest development in Trump's campaign against the independent central bank and its leader. Powell, who was appointed by Trump in 2017 and reappointed by President Joe Biden in 2021, has repeatedly stated that he intends to serve his term until May 15, 2026. A recent Supreme Court decision has reinforced the long-standing interpretation of the law that the Fed chairman cannot be fired due to political disagreements, but only 'for a specific reason'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: July 17, 2025 08:10 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0444\u0438\u043d](http://minfin.com.ua/ua/2025/07/17/154858574/)\n\n**Trump Suggests Scott Bessent as Potential Fed Chairman, but Hints it May Not Happen**\nUS President Trump has expressed that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent could be a potential candidate to replace Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, but hinted that it may not happen. Trump stated, 'He is a candidate, he is very good. No, he is not (my top choice), because I like the work he is doing, right?' Trump has been dissatisfied with Powell's decision not to lower interest rates and has been urging him to resign for months. Trump mentioned that the 2.5 billion dollar renovation of the Federal Reserve building in Washington could be a reason for Powell's removal. When asked if Powell could be replaced due to the renovation costs exceeding budget, Trump replied, 'I think so.' Trump cannot fire Powell due to disagreements over monetary policy, as he appointed Powell as Chairman during his first term and reappointed him during President Biden's term. Other potential candidates to replace Powell include former Federal Reserve Board member Kevin Warsh and Trump's chief economic advisor Kevin Hassett. Bessent stated that the 'official process' for determining Powell's successor has begun, and that 'there are many excellent candidates, and we will wait and see.' Bessent also expressed that it would be confusing if Powell stayed on at the Federal Reserve after his term as Chairman ends in May 2026, as his Federal Reserve Board term will continue until January 31, 2028.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: July 16, 2025 07:30 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202507160185.aspx)\n\n**Bessent suggests Powell should leave Federal Reserve board in May**\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell should step down from the central bank's board when his term as chair ends in May 2026. Bessent stated, 'Traditionally, the Fed chair also steps down as a governor.' Powell's term as a Fed governor does not end until January 2028, leaving it possible for him to remain at the central bank. Bessent also mentioned that 'there's a formal process that's already starting' to identify the next Fed chair, with 'a lot of good candidates inside and outside the Federal Reserve.' When asked if President Donald Trump has asked him to serve as Fed chair, Bessent replied, 'I am part of the decision-making process.' Trump has made clear that he wants Powell's successor to be someone who favours lowering interest rates. Bessent noted that Trump has said 'numerous times he is not going to fire Jay Powell.' Potential contenders to succeed Powell as chair include former Fed governor Kevin Warsh, Trump's current National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, and Bessent himself. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 15, 2025 11:55 PM\nSource:[The Business Times](https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/banking-finance/bessent-suggests-powell-should-leave-federal-reserve-board-may)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a wide range of expert perspectives\u2014including US public administration, central bank governance, political science, economics, and American studies\u2014the consensus is that Jerome Powell is highly likely to remain Chair of the Federal Reserve through January 1, 2026. All experts cite strong legal and institutional constraints: the Federal Reserve Chair can only be removed for cause (not at-will), a standard repeatedly upheld by legal precedent and recent Supreme Court decisions. Historically, Fed Chairs complete their terms, with early departures being extremely rare and only occurring in cases of health or scandal, for which there is currently no sign.\n\nAlthough there is unusually accelerated succession planning\u2014Trump and Treasury Secretary Bessent are publicly searching for a successor and may announce a replacement before Powell\u2019s scheduled term ends in May 2026\u2014this is not seen as a practical or imminent threat to Powell\u2019s tenure. Most experts judge that the fast-tracking of the transition increases the probability of early departure only slightly, due to potential 'soft pressure,' but not enough to outweigh institutional and legal protections.\n\nAll available reporting and public statements from Trump and Bessent explicitly affirm that there is no intention to fire Powell before his term is up. While political volatility and public criticism increase the risk marginally, and the possibility of unforeseen events (health, scandal, a shock legal ruling) is acknowledged, the baseline probability of Powell\u2019s early exit remains extremely low. Aggregate probability estimates from experts range from 2% to 8%, with a tight clustering around 5\u20137%\u2014reflecting only a minor uptick above the historical base rate due to the current politically charged environment and accelerated succession timeline.\n\nIn summary, expert consensus is overwhelming: barring a black swan event, Powell will almost certainly remain as Fed Chair through at least January 1, 2026, and will step down according to the established schedule in May 2026, following longstanding tradition and legal norms.",
