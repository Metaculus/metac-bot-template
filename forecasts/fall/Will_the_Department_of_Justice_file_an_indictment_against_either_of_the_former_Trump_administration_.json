Importantly, recent judicial pushback (Comey case) may chill further aggressive DOJ actions. Given all, I see the probability for an indictment above pure tradition but well below even odds\u2014especially as the cases would be exceptionally weak, high-profile, and vulnerable to reversal or dismissal, inviting institutional caution.

A federal grand jury returns an indictment, possibly on charges tied to the Espionage Act, computer crimes, or minor technicalities regarding classified information, communications security, or leaking under new, broad prosecutorial interpretations.

The presidential memoranda ordering DOJ to investigate Krebs and Taylor are a marked escalation, particularly given that Taylor is organizing visible dissent (defiance.org) and Krebs is a long-standing Trump antagonist. The heavy politicization, increased willingness to proceed with flimsy \u2014 or pretextual \u2014 indictments (as highlighted by judicial criticism), and a lack of institutional guardrails (given the purging of internal DOJ critics) have lowered the threshold for such actions. The remaining time (over a year), the directness of presidential pressure, and the broader campaign against dissident officials collectively suggest meaningfully elevated risk above historical base rates. However, there are still legal and practical constraints\u2014e.g., lack of evident criminality, potential blowback/risk of embarrassment if grand juries refuse, and continued judicial oversight\u2014that moderate the probability.

However, my expertise in federal criminal procedure and the U.S. legal system provides a cautionary balance: historically, even with presidential pressure, actual indictments that lack credible legal foundation face strong institutional resistance, judicial skepticism (as in the Comey judge's admonishments), and practical challenges at the grand jury stage. There is still a non-negligible likelihood of a show indictment filed just before the deadline, especially as time runs short, but the public absence of smoking-gun evidence and the visibly political nature of these cases make it less probable than the pattern seen with others like Comey or Bolton. Therefore, the probability should be above the base rate for unsubstantiated criminal referrals against high-profile dissenters, but not extremely high.

DOJ leadership turnover and rebuke from a federal judge over 'indict first, investigate second' tactics indicate a dramatically weakened norm of institutional restraint. Moreover, both Krebs and Taylor have been publicly named in Trump\u2019s revenge campaign, received presidential memoranda ordering investigation, and had their names attached to allegations of treason or domestic subversion\u2014allegations elevated into broader national-security frameworks via recent memos and executive actions (e.g., NSPM-7). No public reporting shows clear-cut criminal acts, but this has not prevented indictments of multiple higher-profile Trump antagonists. It is possible that DOJ will stop short of indicting Krebs (due to the unusual national security risks and his relatively lower political profile), but Miles Taylor is especially vulnerable: he is accused of leaking, of 'espionage,' and of organizing new forms of resistance that have drawn renewed White House ire. The scenario where neither man is indicted may occur if institutional actors\u2014spurred by legal caution, poor evidence, or judicial interventions\u2014stem the tide, but elite deviance theory, the current trend, and recent precedents all point to a greater than even chance that at least one indictment occurs before the deadline.

Sure, the DOJ has gone after high-profile critics like Comey and Bolton, but both at least had a plausibly articulated charge tethered to some factual controversy \u2013 even if thin. Your elite deviance lens is so fixated on escalating norms violations that you\u2019re treating trendlines as destiny, ignoring the real-world logistical, evidentiary, and reputational hurdles for indicting Krebs and Taylor, who, so far, are accused of nothing but embarrassing Trump. The news does not show a shred of credible, actionable misconduct; prosecutorial actors, despite some being purged, face career risk for failed, obviously pretextual cases (see the angry federal judge in Comey\u2019s prosecution). No leaks, no search warrants, no grand jury rumblings\u2014just public posturing and executive bluster. Even under Trump, the step between a political enemies list and an actual federal indictment remains nontrivial, and judicial scrutiny is growing sharper. 65% isn\u2019t bold, it\u2019s untethered; you\u2019re letting the narrative of drift toward authoritarianism override the sobering institutional friction that still very much exists within federal prosecution. The risk is real, yes, but you\u2019re acting as if a coin flip is all that stands between targeting and indictment. That\u2019s not how DOJ, grand juries, or federal judges actually work, even now."

The high-profile Comey indictment has already drawn furious backlash from a federal judge, showing the system isn\u2019t fully cowed. You cite elite deviance theory as if ignoring prosecutorial, judicial, and institutional frictions is somehow realistic\u2014but you never reconcile the historical vanishingly low base rate for these types of prosecutions. Taylor\u2019s activism and Krebs\u2019s public criticism are not statutory crimes. Even this DOJ, desperate as it is for symbolic scalps, has had to back its cases with at least some evidence (however flimsy). 65% implies indictment is more likely than not; that isn\u2019t supported by any reporting, legal developments, or the pace of grand jury proceedings. Escalation doesn\u2019t mean inevitability. Dial it back\u2014this is a classic case where paranoia outpaces the actual mechanics of American law enforcement."

Yes, partisan polarization and vindictiveness from the DOJ have surged, but as a federal criminal procedure expert, I can tell you that indicting a former high-level official, especially on free speech or dissent, remains a profound institutional leap even today. You note the 'material increase' in base rate but fail to properly discount for the practical legal obstacles: no grand jury news, lack of public evidence, and substantial, recent judicial pushback\u2014even in weaker but more colorable cases like Comey's. Even allowing for a compromised DOJ and pressured officials, the window for action is now tight, and symbolic, misfire-prone indictments risk spectacular failure. A probability nearly 40% is too credulous; it treats the DOJ as an arm of executive will with no procedural brakes, which just isn\u2019t accurate, as the Comey drama shows.

The biggest missing link is concrete investigative activity: there\u2019s zero public sign of ongoing grand jury work targeting these two (compared to Comey/Bolton, where rumblings and subpoenas preceded action). You're right to highlight the risk escalation but then undercut your own logic by failing to anchor probability to demonstrable prosecutorial activity. In the absences of search warrants, leaks of draft charges, or even feverish rumor, all we have is bluster and a few presidential memos\u2014hardly what compels a federal grand jury. The legal standard is one thing, yes, but so is the actual pipeline speed: indictments can be rushed, but rubberstamping for optics requires pretext, and pretext still needs something to dress up as a 'case.'

Political science forecasters love their polarization indices, but that doesn\u2019t substitute for the brute practicalities of getting 16+ jurors to sign off on what would be, by any standard, a banana-republic move without a pretense of evidence (which, as you rightly note, simply isn\u2019t there).

Yet you acknowledge there is no reporting hinting at imminent grand jury action for Krebs or Taylor; you even admit the quit chance is 'less than even odds,' while somehow landing at practically 40%. Partisan climate raises baseline risk but doesn't send process or timeline out the window.

The core flaw is treating the procedural frictions revealed in the Comey fiasco as a reliable brake, when in fact they may simply redirect or delay, not prevent. Political polarization theory tells us that when party control aligns across executive and DOJ, and especially when norm-breaking is incentivized as 'base-pleasing,' the odds of symbolic action\u2014even if ultimately legally embarrassing\u2014can rise sharply, judiciary scoldings be damned. You dismiss a ~40% risk as overreach, but fail to engage the empirical reality: multiple pretextual indictments have already happened under this regime, and public evidence mattered little then. You're betting DOJ inertia will reassert itself in the clutch, not recognizing enough institutional actors have been replaced or cowed that a last-minute indictment\u2014perhaps even crafted in legally trivial terms\u2014remains an exceptionally live threat. Status quo legal doctrine is not self-enforcing in a context of norm collapse and open vendetta.

The critics screaming about base rates and the sanctity of legal process are at risk of confusing aspiration with reality. You\u2019re correct to point out that guardrails have crumbled: with the string of politicized indictments, mass firings at DOJ, and a president personally ordering probes of named enemies, what remains of the institutional constraint against fabricated charges? The chilling reality is that the environment is making the previously unthinkable not just possible but thinkable: even if it\u2019s not *likely* in strict statistical terms, it\u2019s absolutely within the realm of operational plausibility that a prosecutor\u2014eager to please or scared for their job\u2014bolts out an indictment on any threadbare theory.

The critique further convinced me not to drift toward higher probabilities. No new public evidence, leaks, or procedural signals about imminent action against Krebs or Taylor were raised in deliberations. Bottom line: my initial assessment remains solid.

With less than two months left, the complete absence of reporting on grand jury moves, search warrants, or charging drafts, combined with mounting judicial and public pushback, makes a last-minute indictment against Krebs or Taylor still improbable\u2014though not impossible due to the uniquely degraded prosecutorial discretion and Trump's explicit pressure. The most likely pathway remains a headline indictment for political theater, but this would require even looser pretext than seen so far, and the window for spontaneous action is rapidly narrowing.

Moreover, group discussion raised the point that, while DOJ norms are weakened, every prior high-profile indictment has at least offered a colorable legal rationale; we have none for Krebs/Taylor, and the window for initiating such a case is narrowing. I also found agreement that, even in this environment, grand juries are not mere formalities and that process speed\u2014or lack thereof\u2014is telling.

The procedural friction, lack of observable investigatory action (grand jury movement, leaks, subpoenas), and visible judicial resistance (e.g., Comey judge\u2019s admonitions) carry significant weight, as does the logistics of building and filing a plausible indictment in under two months. While sociological and political science perspectives stress the longer-term erosion of prosecutorial norms, they appear to over-weight trend over near-term realities. My prior estimate was therefore high enough to reflect the above-baseline risk but low enough to respect the grinding pace and resistance of legal process.

My initial probability was shaped by partisan polarization theory, highlighting the dramatically raised base rate and willingness to persecute dissenters. However, critiques from federal criminal procedure, grand jury, and prosecutorial discretion perspectives highlight important realities: (1) No grand jury activity or leaks suggest movement toward indictment of Krebs or Taylor; (2) backlash and resistance among institutional actors, including judges, is visible; (3) even in this broken-norm environment, logistical, procedural, and evidentiary challenges are nontrivial, especially with the DOJ's bandwidth stretched.

According to retired FBI special agent Jody Weis, Brennan claimed he first saw the dossier after the 2016 election and that the CIA was opposed to including it in the 2016 Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA). However, evidence, including an email stating 'my bottom line is that I believe that the information warrants inclusion in the report,' contradicts this. Weis revealed that Brennan overruled senior CIA analysts' objections and insisted on including the dossier, despite its lack of reliability. The House report confirmed the ICA referenced and summarized the dossier, undermining Brennan\u2019s claim that it was not used. The investigation follows Brennan\u2019s referral to the DOJ for potential criminal prosecution, with GOP lawmakers like Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan demanding indictment. The DOJ\u2019s actions, along with the indictment of James Comey, are seen by critics as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to hold Obama-era officials accountable for their roles in the 'Russia collusion hoax,' which, according to the report, 'totally undermined President [Donald] Trump's first term.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 06:55 PM\nSource:[WCIV](https://abcnews4.com/news/nation-world/doj-gearing-up-to-issue-grand-jury-subpoenas-amid-john-brennan-investigation-reports)\n\n**Vance Lands in an Unholy Mess as ICE Barbie Goon Trashes the Pope**\nTricia McLaughlin, the assistant homeland security secretary and chief spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), publicly dismissed Pope Leo XIV's plea for pastoral access to detained migrants as false, stating that religious organizations have 'ALWAYS been welcome' and that ICE 'does not separate families.'

The filing, submitted by acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan and Deputy U.S. Attorney Tyler Lemmons, contradicts Comey\u2019s prior testimony that he did not approve outside or anonymous press engagement on major cases. The documents include emails showing Comey was briefed by Richman\u2014listed as a special government employee (SGE)\u2014on media contacts related to the Clinton email investigation, even as Richman\u2019s official paperwork lapsed and remained unsigned in late 2016. Handwritten notes from late September 2016, found in a secure FBI facility, indicate Comey was aware of intelligence suggesting a plan by Hillary Clinton to tie Donald Trump to Russia\u2014raising questions about the accuracy of his 2020 Senate testimony. Richman admitted to speaking with reporters on Comey\u2019s behalf, including New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, and sought to correct unfavorable media coverage and shape future reporting. Records show he distributed Comey\u2019s memos in 2017. Comey faces charges of making false statements and obstructing Congress, with a trial set for January 5, 2026. He pleaded not guilty. The indictment, secured before the statute of limitations expired, was sought by Halligan, who replaced Erik Siebert as U.S. attorney. President Donald Trump responded by calling Comey 'worse than a Democrat' and asserting others who 'weaponized the Department of Justice' could also face indictment. Former Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk accused Comey of misconduct, calling him 'the most corrupt FBI Director' and comparing him to Jussie Smollett. White House adviser Peter Navarro labeled Comey 'the mastermind or the useful idiot' behind the Steele dossier. Fox News\u2019s Trey Gowdy argued Comey believed he had moral authority to override established processes, citing the July 2016 Clinton announcement, the October letter to Congress, and his 2020 testimony. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and John Cornyn (R-TX) called the indictment 'long time overdue' and emphasized the need for accountability, with Graham noting Comey had intelligence about Clinton\u2019s alleged plan and Cornyn claiming Comey was 'bound and determined to destroy' Trump after his 2017 firing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/05/doj-filing-james-comey-expected-president-elect-clinton-approved-anonymous-communication-with-nyt-other-press/)\n\n**Judge in Comey case admonishes Justice Department for \"indict first, investigate second\" posture**\nA federal judge, Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick in Alexandria, Virginia, criticized the Justice Department's prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey, calling its approach of 'indict first, investigate second' 'highly unusual.' The judge ordered the Justice Department to provide all grand jury evidence and related materials to Comey's legal team by the close of business on Thursday, November 6, 2025, underscoring his concern over prosecutors' conduct. Comey was indicted in October 2025 on one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice related to his 2017 Senate testimony about whether he authorized anonymous leaks during the FBI\u2019s investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. The indictment specifically alleges that Comey falsely denied giving permission to Daniel Richman, a Columbia University law professor and longtime friend, to serve as an anonymous source. Evidence central to the case includes data collected during the 'Arctic Haze' investigation (2019\u20132020), which examined how classified details about the Clinton probe leaked into a 2017 New York Times article. Four warrants were executed on Richman during that probe, and his seized materials\u2014such as hard drives, phone, and email records\u2014may contain evidence relevant to the indictment. Comey\u2019s attorneys, including Rebekah Donaleski and Patrick Fitzgerald, stated they have not been granted access to this data and cannot screen it for privileged information. Donaleski expressed 'grave concern' that the withholding of evidence may violate the Fourth Amendment. Fitzgerald noted delays in obtaining his security clearance have prevented him from accessing classified evidence. Nathaniel Lemons, an assistant U.S. attorney leading the prosecution, argued that the evidence is secured and will not be accessed until the court approves a handling plan. Judge Fitzpatrick emphasized that Comey\u2019s legal team is 'entitled to this information quickly' and warned prosecutors they may use evidence 'at their own risk' if it is later found to be privileged.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 08:05 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/james-comey-case-judge-indict-first-investigate-second/)\n\n**Judge scolds Comey prosecutors, orders records to be produced**\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ordered prosecutors to provide grand jury records and evidence from the investigation into former FBI Director James Comey by the end of Thursday, November 6, 2025, criticizing the Department of Justice (DOJ) for 'indict first and investigate later.' Comey, who was present at the hearing but did not speak, and his lawyers stated they had not seen the materials, prompting the judge to declare, 'We're going to fix that, and we're going to fix that today.' The materials include communications between Comey and Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman, a special government employee at the FBI, seized in 2019 and 2020. Prosecutors allege Comey encouraged Richman to speak with reporters and lied to Congress about authorizing anonymous sources. Comey pleaded not guilty last month to charges related to false testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020, where he claimed he did not authorize a media leak about the FBI's investigation into Hillary Clinton and the Trump-Russia probe. The DOJ defended President Trump's social media posts calling for Comey's prosecution, asserting they were not retaliatory, while Comey's lawyers argued the case is politically motivated and a departure from the DOJ's traditional ethical standards. Trump had used Truth Social to call for the prosecution of Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former national security advisor John Bolton, all of whom have since been indicted.

The New York Times reported that law enforcement seized Wien's phone in connection with the probe. A White House spokesperson condemned doxxing and threats against administration officials and their families, stating such actions should be thoroughly investigated. Wien's lawyer argued the protest was protected speech, asserting that 'they were speaking truth to power, and that is really at the core of our Constitution.' Meanwhile, conservative online influencers falsely claimed that several Arizona teachers mocked slain MAGA figure Charlie Kirk with their Halloween costumes, leading to a wave of threats against the educators. Donald Trump's pardon of Changpeng Zhao, a convicted crypto figure with ties to the Trump family's cryptocurrency ventures, raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest, as Trump claimed ignorance of the pardon's implications. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, publicly criticized former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, over allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor, citing a 2024 House Ethics report that found 'substantial evidence' of possible violations of state laws, though the Justice Department declined to file charges. The controversy reflects growing internal conflict within the MAGA movement over antisemitism and extremist sympathies. Additionally, the Trump administration's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as revealed by a Federal Reserve Office of Inspector General audit, has put Americans' confidential data at risk. A newly launched Trump website falsely blames Democrats for a government shutdown by spreading debunked claims about criminal immigrants receiving health care, a narrative also repeated by Trump in a '60 Minutes' interview. PolitiFact has refuted these claims. Furthermore, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Chicago are using facial recognition technology that state police are prohibited from using, raising privacy and civil liberties concerns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 08:02 PM\nSource:[MSNBC.com](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/stephen-katie-miller-address-protester-phone-rcna241891)\n\n**'If it was anybody else, we'd arrest him tomorrow': Justice Department aide said of Trump**\nOn August 8, 2022, FBI agents conducted a surprise search of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate, seizing hundreds of pages of top-secret classified documents, including materials related to covert government operations and U.S. spying powers that could endanger operatives if exposed. Assistant Attorney General Matt Olsen convened a conference call that evening, during which Justice Department expert Julie Edelstein stated, 'If it was anybody else, we would arrest him tomorrow,' underscoring the severity of knowingly retaining and concealing classified records after a May 2022 subpoena. The investigation was triggered by a critical tip from Molly Michael, a former Trump aide, who provided a photo showing over 80 boxes of documents stored at Mar-a-Lago\u2014far more than the 15 boxes Trump had returned to the National Archives. Despite Trump\u2019s public cooperation, including welcoming FBI agents and claiming to be 'an open book,' the search revealed extensive mismanagement of sensitive materials. The Justice Department and FBI faced internal and external pressure: FBI Director Chris Wray sought to justify the raid publicly, but DOJ officials delayed a statement fearing political backlash. The classified documents were so sensitive that even top officials like Olsen lacked clearance to view some, with certain materials requiring presidential or cabinet-level authorization. The search triggered violent reactions, including a threatening post on Gab by a Trump supporter and a failed assault on an FBI field office in Cincinnati by a Navy veteran, who later died in a standoff. The agents involved were evacuated for safety after their names were leaked. A year later, Special Counsel Jack Smith indicted Trump on 37 felony counts, but a Trump-appointed judge dismissed the case on questionable legal grounds. The account, drawn from interviews for the book 'Injustice: How Politics and Fear Vanquished America's Justice Department,' reveals deep institutional tension, national security risks, and the unprecedented political pressures facing the Justice Department.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 11:39 AM\nSource:[MSNBC.com](https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/news/trump-arrest-classified-documents-probe-maralago-rcna241155)\n\n**Former senior DHS official Miles Taylor launches new web tool to plan protests against Trump administration**\nMiles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has launched a new website called defiance.org on November 1, 2025, to coordinate peaceful, lawful, and defiant resistance against President Trump and his policies. The platform, backed by a bipartisan coalition of over 50 former national security officials, whistleblowers, and elected officials\u2014including former Republican congressmen Reid Ribble, Denver Riggleman, and Joe Walsh\u2014aims to serve as a centralized 'Google' for activism, offering resources for protests, legal defense, and mutual aid. Taylor, who anonymously authored a 2018 New York Times op-ed alleging a 'quiet resistance' within Trump\u2019s administration, disclosed his authorship in 2020. The site was launched in response to the October 'No Kings' rallies and features a video from actor Robert DeNiro urging civic action. The White House has sharply criticized Taylor, calling him a 'TDS clown' and accusing him of fabricating claims about a government 'resistance' and leaking classified information. In April 2025, President Trump issued an executive memo ordering investigations into Taylor\u2019s conduct, including revoking his security clearances. Taylor denies any wrongdoing. The site\u2019s mission includes supporting those targeted by the administration, with future plans to mobilize legal and public support for figures like Senator Adam Schiff, who is under Justice Department investigation. Taylor emphasized that defiance.org is a 'nationwide mutual aid pact' to defend Americans against political overreach and retaliation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 08:40 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/former-senior-dhs-official-miles-taylor-new-web-tool-to-plan-protests-against-trump-administration/)\n\n**Trump Administration Accused of Disseminating Manipulated Videos on Protests and Immigration Operations, Report Reveals**\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released manipulated videos on social media in August, falsely claiming to show federal agents 'taking over Washington,' but the footage was compiled from operations in Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, Florida, and Nantucket, over 600 km from the capital. According to a Washington Post report, at least six recent videos with similar visual or geographic distortions\u2014promoting an anti-immigration agenda\u2014have garnered millions of views, illustrating the growing use of misleading content by the Trump administration in its digital strategy. The White House and DHS did not dispute the inaccuracies but defended the videos, stating they represent a 'small percentage' of over 400 annual posts and aim to highlight law enforcement work. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin stated, 'Violence and riots against law enforcement are unacceptable, regardless of location,' while White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson affirmed the administration would continue using 'engaging content and memorable memes' to promote the president's agenda. The strategy involves internal photographers and videographers documenting ICE raids and protests to create viral social media content. One widely viewed video depicting chaos in Chicago used footage from other states and was seen over 1.4 million times, exemplifying how image manipulation can shape public perception, according to experts. John Cohen, former DHS official now at the Internet Security Center, warned that such inaccuracy undermines public trust: 'If people believe you are imprecise or not objectively assessing a threat, they won\u2019t listen.' The report also found videos falsely presenting operations in Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, and Nantucket as occurring in Washington, and using footage from Illinois to depict events in Oregon and Tennessee. Another video falsely claimed that prior administrations had 'eroded our way of life' but showed 2019 operations under Trump\u2019s first term. The ICE also published a retouched photo of a woman holding a sign in Portland, editing out a police insult on the ground. Eddie Perez, former civic integrity director at X, criticized the government\u2019s approach: 'We are witnessing the collapse of governmental responsibility through fact-based communication. They are not communicating actions and results. They are acting like filmmakers, trying to make people laugh, scare them, inspire emotions\u2014regardless of truth.' Trump, who has advocated for using the military in an 'internal war,' has pressured for deploying National Guard troops to major U.S. cities\u2014mostly Democratic-leaning\u2014to combat crime and protests against his mass deportation campaign. Despite local authorities stating most mobilizations were peaceful and violence was easily contained, Trump militarized policing in Washington in August, sent troops to Memphis in September, and deployed nearly 5,000 National Guard members and marines to Los Angeles in June during protests over aggressive immigration enforcement in California. Most troops have since been withdrawn.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 03:01 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/10/30/governo-trump-divulgou-videos-manipulados-sobre-protestos-e-operacoes-anti-imigracao-diz-jornal.ghtml)\n\n**Kristi Noem's DHS accused of 'fabricating' report critical of FEMA**\nA report investigating claims that FEMA diverted disaster aid to undocumented immigrants and neglected U.S. citizens in areas supporting Donald Trump found no evidence to substantiate the allegations. Despite this, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and her leadership allegedly suppressed the original findings and commissioned a new report containing false allegations against President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and FEMA workers, according to former senior FEMA officials cited by CNN. The initial investigation was prompted by claims made by Donald Trump following Hurricane Helene, but was ultimately deemed unsubstantiated. However, DHS leadership reportedly demanded a revised report, which concluded that FEMA employees under Biden intentionally delayed aid for political reasons\u2014a claim now disputed by former DHS and FEMA officials. CNN reported that investigators noted a few instances where canvassers mentioned 'Trump' or 'Biden' in notes, but these were typically related to gun signage, not political bias, and the report did not demonstrate that aid was denied due to such notations. Former officials accused Noem and DHS of spreading misinformation to justify dismantling FEMA, framing disaster aid as a political tool. One unnamed FEMA official stated, 'They\u2019ve been looking to prove that narrative any way they can... don\u2019t fabricate it because it meets your political narrative. That\u2019s just bad government.' Regarding claims of armed confrontations between residents and FEMA workers, a former supervisor dismissed them as implausible, saying, 'FEMA employees are not law enforcement officers... this idea that they\u2019re just going to run into harm\u2019s way to register somebody is ridiculous.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/noem-fema/)\n\n**Two Federal Prosecutors Placed on Leave Hours After Including 'Inflammatory Misrepresentations' About Jan. 6 in Court Filing**\nTwo federal prosecutors, Carlos Valdivia and Samuel White, from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., were placed on leave by the Department of Justice hours after filing a sentencing memorandum in the case of Taylor Taranto. The memorandum described Jan. 6, 2021, protesters as 'a mob of rioters,' which the Department of Justice reportedly deemed 'inflammatory misrepresentations.' According to ABC News and The Washington Post, both prosecutors were locked out of their government devices and informed they would be on enforced furlough until the federal shutdown ends, after which they would be placed on leave. The filing occurred in the case of Taranto, who was pardoned by President Donald Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 protests but was later convicted in May 2025 on three counts related to a 2023 bomb hoax. The Justice Department did not comment on the disciplinary action. The sentencing memorandum alleged that Taranto entered the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 attack and later promoted conspiracy theories. Taranto was convicted of illegally carrying two firearms without a license, unlawfully possessing ammunition, and making false statements and hoaxes. On June 28, 2023, he livestreamed himself claiming to be working on a detonator and threatening to drive a car bomb into the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which houses a neutron reactor. He then drove to Alexandria, Virginia, parked his van in the middle of the street, and fled. Police found two firearms, multiple magazines, and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in his vehicle during a search. Taranto faces sentencing before U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro stated that violence and threats against law enforcement or government officials are taken extremely seriously, regardless of political affiliation. Journalist Julie Kelly posted on X that the prosecutors had been furloughed due to the shutdown but were then placed on leave, calling it 'Good.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 05:22 PM\nSource:[The Western Journal](https://www.westernjournal.com/two-federal-prosecutors-placed-leave-hours-including-inflammatory-misrepresentations-jan-6-court-filing/)\n\n**Trump White House Defends Misleading DHS Propaganda Because They Are 'Banger Memes'**\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been accused of disseminating misleading, mislabeled, and digitally altered videos to promote President Donald Trump's immigration agenda, according to a Washington Post investigation published on October 29, 2025. The report identified at least six DHS-produced videos over the past three months that misrepresented the location, timing, or context of footage. One August montage claiming to show federal agents securing Washington, D.C., featured scenes filmed months earlier in Los Angeles, West Palm Beach, and off the coast of Nantucket\u2014over 400 miles from the capital. Another video promoting 'Antifa terrorists' attacking federal facilities in Portland was actually filmed outside an ICE building in Broadview, Illinois, 1,700 miles away, and cropped out the original journalist\u2019s watermark. A clip about a federal surge in Memphis used footage from the same Illinois facility without disclosure. Additionally, footage used to highlight border failures showed events from 2019\u2014during Trump\u2019s first term\u2014despite being presented as recent. In one case, an image of a woman holding a pro-ICE sign in Portland was digitally altered to remove a Spanish-language curse\u2014'Chinga la migra'\u2014written on the pavement beneath her. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has faced criticism for her highly staged, media-friendly appearances, often involving full makeup, law enforcement gear, and cameras, which critics describe as social media-optimized photo-ops rather than factual reporting. The White House defended the strategy as using 'engaging content and banger memes,' with spokesperson Abigail Jackson refusing to issue corrections. Experts, including former DHS official John Cohen and former Twitter civic integrity leader Eddie Perez, warned that such deceptive editing risks eroding public trust, especially during emergencies, and likened the administration\u2019s approach to 'filmmakers' prioritizing emotional manipulation over factual truth. Despite backlash, DHS has expanded its in-house media operation, hiring videographers, deploying drones, and producing news-style segments that denounce 'fake news hoaxes' and direct viewers to government channels for the 'FACTS.' The investigation, co-authored by Drew Harwell and Joyce Soyhun Lee, includes side-by-side comparisons of original footage and the edited versions used in DHS social media posts, available via The Washington Post (paywalled).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:32 PM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/trump-white-house-defends-misleading-dhs-propaganda-because-they-are-banger-memes/)\n\n**Trump admin just made a 'tacit admission' on explosive press leaks: ex-Trump official**\nA former Trump administration official, Miles Taylor, claimed on October 24, 2025, that the lack of investigations into recent media leaks from government officials constitutes a 'tacit admission' that the leaks originated from Trump's top aides. Taylor argued that these leaks\u2014detailing ongoing legal cases against political adversaries such as former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James, and former National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2014were likely authorized by the Trump administration to strengthen its legal cases. He questioned why the Justice Department (DOJ) and FBI have not investigated the sources, stating, 'If Trump's hand-picked people aren't the ones dishing to the media, then who is?' Taylor described the administration's actions as a 'tacit admission' that top officials are leaking classified information. He criticized the administration for creating 'the most openly political Justice Department in modern American history,' asserting that laws are applied only to Trump's critics. He cited a CNN report based on an anonymous source with inside knowledge of the case against Bolton, whom Trump's DOJ indicted for allegedly mishandling classified material, calling the situation 'hard to overstate the hypocrisy.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 24, 2025 02:40 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/trump-2674230015/)\n\n**'In tears and shaking': Vocal Trump critics fear being next targets in revenge campaign**\nFollowing the U.S. Department of Justice's ongoing indictments of political opponents of former President Donald Trump, vocal critics such as Miles Taylor and Olivia Troye fear they may be targeted in a potential revenge campaign. Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official, recounted his wife being 'in tears and shaking' after receiving a death threat calling for him to be executed by a firing squad, shortly after Trump labeled him an 'egregious leaker and disseminator of falsehoods' in a memo. Taylor, who anonymously authored a 2018 New York Times op-ed detailing internal resistance within the Trump administration, stated he has not committed any crimes and continues to criticize Trump despite the personal and professional toll. Olivia Troye, a former homeland security staffer for Vice President Mike Pence, expressed fear after the August 22 search of former National Security Advisor John Bolton\u2019s home, worrying about a similar search at her residence while caring for her elderly mother.

These actions align with Trump\u2019s public promises made prior to his re-election, including his statement at the 2023 CPAC conference where he declared, 'I am your avenger.' CNN reported on several cases, including the indictment of former National Security Advisor John Bolton over classified document leaks, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who was charged in connection with a lawsuit against Trump and his family over alleged financial fraud. Other affected individuals include former FBI Director James Comey, who was indicted on perjury charges, and special prosecutor Jack Smith, who is now under federal investigation. Numerous federal employees, including those from the Department of Justice, FBI, and independent oversight bodies like the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), have been dismissed without clear justification. Former officials involved in the January 6 Capitol riot investigation, such as FBI\u2019s James Denney and Michael Gordon, were also dismissed. High-profile figures like Mark Milley, Miles Taylor, and Chris Krebs, who served in Trump\u2019s first administration, are under scrutiny. Additionally, NOAA officials involved in the 'Shapi-gate' scandal\u2014where Trump allegedly pressured the agency to alter hurricane forecasts\u2014were placed on administrative leave. Labor Department\u2019s Erica M. McEntaffer and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Director Jeffrey Kruse were dismissed over reports critical of Trump\u2019s policies. Even academic appointments, such as Jen Easterly\u2019s at West Point, were canceled after political backlash. Over 100 individuals, including former President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and senior officials like Tony Blinken and Hillary Clinton, had their security clearances revoked under Trump\u2019s orders.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 02:31 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251017068300009)\n\n**Former Trump Aide Slams DHS's 'Wildly Irresponsible' Video**\nMiles Taylor, former DHS chief of staff under President Trump, condemned a new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) promotional video as 'creepy,' 'stupid,' and 'wildly irresponsible,' calling it the 'creepiest' ever released by the agency. The video, posted on X (formerly Twitter) on October 6, 2025, featured a quote from Theodore Roosevelt about the federal government's right to defend itself against 'nullification, secession, or rebellion'\u2014a 1887 statement originally aimed at rejecting state-level resistance to federal law\u2014paired with footage of ICE officers deploying from a compound, confronting crowds, and returning smugly. Taylor, who authored the 2018 'Anonymous' op-ed and later the book *A Warning*, criticized the video\u2019s framing of domestic protest as equivalent to rebellion, calling it a dangerous propaganda stunt. The backlash follows a series of controversial DHS media efforts: a Pok\u00e9mon-themed ICE highlight reel that used mock 'cards' with the slogan 'Gotta catch 'em all,' and a promotional video featuring footage from a Chicago apartment raid\u2014where residents alleged children were dragged naked and seniors were zip-tied\u2014without acknowledging those claims. The DHS has been investing heavily in a 'Stronger Border' public relations campaign, reportedly preparing to spend millions to promote Secretary Kristi Noem\u2019s enforcement agenda. Taylor, who was recently labeled an 'egregious leaker' by the White House and had his clearances suspended, has denied the allegations while continuing to oppose Trump\u2019s policies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 09:53 AM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/former-trump-aide-slams-dhss-wildly-irresponsible-video/)\n\n**Ex-Trump Aide Warns of 'Orwellian' White House Memo - Inquisitr News**\nMiles Taylor, a former senior Trump administration official and DHS chief of staff, has issued a stark warning about National Security Presidential Memorandum-7 (NSPM-7), titled 'Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,' issued on September 25, 2025. Taylor describes the memo as 'Orwellian' and one of the most alarming government documents he has ever read, arguing it grants the White House sweeping authority to redefine protest as 'domestic terrorism' and expand surveillance to individuals, nonprofits, donors, and online activists based on ideological indicators such as anti-American or anti-capitalist views. The memo broadens the definition of 'organized political violence' and directs federal agencies to investigate and dismantle networks linked to such activity, including foundations and funders. Critics, including civil-liberties watchdogs and legal experts, warn that this could lead to the criminalization of dissent, with minor legal infractions or even online sharing of content potentially resulting in individuals being placed on watchlists typically reserved for foreign terrorist organizations like ISIS and al Qaeda. The administration claims NSPM-7 is a necessary response to 'heinous' political violence, citing incidents like the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, and asserts it will dismantle networks that 'incite' violence. However, the memo's broad language, combined with a separate executive action designating 'Antifa' as a terrorist organization\u2014despite no legal framework for such a domestic designation\u2014has raised alarms about the creation of a de facto domestic terrorism regime. Taylor urges Congress and the courts to intervene before political activism is equated with terrorism. The Justice Department has already circulated guidance enabling tax and criminal scrutiny of nonprofits linked to unrest, signaling enforcement actions are underway. The central question now is who defines the line between protest and terrorism, and how much power the White House should hold over that boundary.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 07:54 PM\nSource:[The Inquisitr](https://www.inquisitr.com/ex-trump-aide-warns-of-orwellian-white-house-memo)\n\n**Ex-Trump Official On 'Enemies List' Outlines 8 Ways To Defy His 'Wannabe-Dictator Tantrums'**\nThe article reports that former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor, who had previously criticized President Donald Trump in a 2018 New\u202fYork\u202fTimes essay, has issued an eight\u2011point plan of action on X (formerly Twitter) after Trump ordered the Department of Justice to investigate him for alleged treason. Taylor states, '1. First, I will not shut up,' and continues, '2. I will not apologize for telling the truth,' among other points. He claims the investigation stems from a memorandum in April that labeled his conduct as a possible violation of the Espionage Act. Taylor also notes his inclusion on the \u2018Random Enemies List\u2019 in the 2023 book *Government Gangsters* and asserts he will not fear retaliation, saying, 'I will not fear,' and that he will continue to organize politically against Trump. The piece presents these statements as Taylor\u2019s response to the investigation, without providing counter\u2011perspectives or official DOJ statements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 04:57 PM\nSource:[HuffPost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/miles-taylor-donald-trump-defy-dictator-tantrums_n_68d3e8a1e4b0ae58bfe9f828)\n\n",

    "summary": "The forecasts from experts across law, political science, and sociology show a divided but generally elevated assessment that the Department of Justice (DOJ) may file an indictment against Christopher Krebs or Miles Taylor before January 1, 2026, compared to historical norms. Common to all forecasts is the recognition that, historically, such indictments for political dissent, whistleblowing, or public criticism are extremely rare and almost unheard of; normally, official criminal charges against ex-officials would require clear evidence of substantial federal crimes. \n\nHowever, experts widely note the highly politicized and unprecedented pattern of DOJ activity under the current Trump administration, marked by presidential memoranda explicitly ordering investigations into Krebs and Taylor, and recent indictments of prominent adversaries (Comey, Bolton, Letitia James) on what are often viewed as weak or pretextual grounds. Factors increasing the probability cited by nearly all experts include direct executive pressure, norm erosion in DOJ prosecutorial independence, willingness to pursue retaliatory or symbolic indictments, broadened legal definitions of dissent or leaks, and the public campaigns against both Krebs and Taylor. \n\nCounterbalancing these pressures are several moderating factors: the persistent lack of credible public evidence that Krebs or Taylor committed indictable offenses (their conduct appears to be protected speech or standard dissent), judicial pushback and admonishments for previous politicized indictments, resource and timing constraints with less than two months remaining, internal DOJ resistance, and risks of further public backlash and legal embarrassment. Most experts believe that while indictments could be filed for largely symbolic or deterrent effect (even if destined for legal reversal), the institutional and evidentiary obstacles remain significant. \n\nMost legal and political science experts, weighting these factors, estimate the chance of indictment in the 27\u201339% range, highlighting a much greater risk than in any typical U.S. administration, but still less likely than not due to weak case specifics and mounting institutional resistance. The notable exception is the sociological (Elite Deviance Theory) perspective, which places heavier emphasis on recent observed patterns of elite retribution and institutional capture, resulting in a higher forecast (65%). All agree that of the two, Miles Taylor, as an ongoing opposition organizer and public antagonist, is at somewhat greater risk if any indictment proceeds.\n\nIn summary: Experts largely concur that the probability of a DOJ indictment against Krebs or Taylor before January 1, 2026, has risen well above historical norms\u2014primarily because of unprecedented executive pressure, politicized DOJ behavior, and recent indictments of other critics\u2014but, for most, the scenario is still less likely than not, with estimated probabilities clustering around 27\u201339%, except for the sociological outlier at 65%.",
