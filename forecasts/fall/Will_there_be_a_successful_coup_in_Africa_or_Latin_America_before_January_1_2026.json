Although juntas in the Sahel have employed aggressive coup-proofing, foreign mercenary deployments, and repression, this can breed further discontent (history shows junta-on-junta coups remain common, as in Burkina Faso).

Factors increasing coup risk\u2014ongoing elite contestation, fraying military discipline, mounting jihadist/security crises, and reliance on foreign support\u2014remain high, although the shortening time frame and recent crackdowns dampen possibilities. Regional Security Complex Theory suggests that coup activity often clusters and has not fully run its course in current risk regions; however, since several major regime axes are now dominated by juntas, the opportunities for further coups may be narrowing as power consolidates and purges occur. Latin America appears considerably less vulnerable to a successful coup (with the exception of a possible self-coup scenario, but no imminent crisis is reported there right now). Given the extreme recency of failed and successful attempts in West Africa, the ongoing regional and external pressures, and the five-week window, an elevated but not extreme probability is justified.",

Latin America, despite sporadic attempts, features much stronger baseline constraints against successful coups, and recent events (Brazil, Peru, Bolivia) have not yielded regime overthrows.

Latin America, by contrast, has not seen a successful coup in over a decade and is not exhibiting significant coup enabling structures at the present. Critically, while several African states show repression and instability, most incumbent juntas have maintained cohesion and foreign (Russian, Turkish) backing, blunting immediate risk. Guinea-Bissau's defective election could trigger a destabilizing event but the opposition is already sidelined and the security sector is under executive control. Therefore, the short time horizon (six weeks), relative absence of scheduled transitions, and current regime resilience suggest a higher-than-baseline but less-than-even risk\u2014driven almost exclusively by the African Sahel.

Alternatively, an incumbent leader (in Africa or Latin America) attempting a self-coup (illegally extending their rule at transition) might be overthrown by another elite faction or the military. Fragile constitutional transitions (e.g., Benin\u2019s new system, Guinea-Bissau\u2019s exclusionary election) or strongman succession crises (e.g., CAR late 2025 presidential bid) could also trigger successful coups if rival elites are marginalized and perceive institutional avenues as fully blocked.",

Elite Theory suggests that coups are initiated when elite bargains break down and excluded factions believe security, external support, and legitimacy can be rapidly seized. While the presence of Russian (and to some extent Turkish/Chinese) advisors has enabled some junta stabilization (and thus, a short 'coup-proofing' effect), it has not fundamentally resolved elite vulnerability if cracks open at the top. Recent reports confirm coup/putschist sentiment, attempts, and detentions in Nigeria and Mali, suggesting elite splits are active, even if attempts have lately failed. The coup base rate for Africa (as measured from Powell/Thyne, VOA, and recent years) is roughly 1-2 successful coups/year, with clustering observed. Latin America remains relatively low risk short-term due to elite consensus and effective containment of populist or militarist uprisings. The timeframe (1.5 months) is short, which decreases probability from the annual average somewhat, as plotting and conducting a full coup (and consolidating control) is not trivial, especially when recent attempts have been disrupted and elite-purge strategies are ongoing. Still, the structural conditions\u2014especially in the Sahel, Guinea-Bissau, CAR, and perhaps Benin\u2014are unusually volatile, and just one elite failure/circulation event will be enough for a Yes outcome. My best estimate, reflecting both elite theory logic and base rates, is that there is a moderately high (~34%) chance that at least one successful coup will occur in Africa or Latin America within the forecast window, with Africa strongly more likely.",

Multiple warning articles in October and November specifically reference failed or foiled coup plots (most recently in Nigeria, Guinea-Bissau, and Mali), high levels of regime paranoia, and fundamental elite and social grievances in the Sahel. External Russian involvement both mildly hardens regime survival and increases coup-triggering grievances. Latin America, by contrast, remains relatively stable, but cannot be totally ruled out.

Several defensible approaches\u2014Comparative Authoritarianism, Neo-Patrimonialism, and my own\u2014converge at the lower end (13-15%), citing regime consolidation, coup-proofing, and the very short window as decisive limiters. The strongest argument for a slightly higher estimate is the historically elevated base rate for Africa in recent years and cascading regional warning indicators; however, even critics of the low estimate agree that the abnormally high numbers of attempted/foiled coups haven\u2019t translated into actual regime changes in late 2025. No new, compelling evidence has emerged in deliberation to warrant a sharp upward move: the pro-revision arguments reiterate familiar signals (instability, elite fractures) but fail to overcome the strong inertial forces and security environment now in place.

Although there were strong defenses for slightly higher probabilities rooted in CoupTrap logic, no new warning indicator, either structural or event-driven (e.g., imminent leadership transition, real-time mutiny leakage, dramatic shift in external patronage), compels a meaningful upward revision at this time.

Critiques of higher (~30-40%) probabilities were persuasive, emphasizing how coup clusters produce subsequent lulls rather than immediate repeated overthrows, especially when regimes are highly alert. At the same time, I did not find arguments for a dramatically lower probability (e.g., sub-15%) compelling, since the underlying structural vulnerabilities, documented recent plot attempts, and elite fissures\u2014especially in the Sahel and Guinea-Bissau\u2014keep risk materially elevated over historical peacetime baselines. Discussion also affirmed that Latin America's risk remains functionally negligible in this window.

This typically suppresses immediate coup risk by intimidating or capturing plotters and leaves an interval where regimes are harder to surprise. Several critiques also correctly note that successful coups\u2014especially those that consolidate control rapidly\u2014are rare even in the highest base-rate environments over a ~6-week interval, and that after a coup cluster the tempo usually drops before another flare, not lessens. The consensus among the empirically cautious is that the base rate justifies elevated risk, but the current moment is less combustible than the ongoing state fragility alone would suggest.

Peers highlighting post-coup regime hardening, reduced elite mobility, and the recurrence of failed attempts underscored that successful coups remain rare in such a narrow period, even at an elevated regional base rate. The low probabilities argued by neopat, comparative authoritarianism, and civil-military specialists demonstrated the empirical rarity of a successful, consolidated coup in the immediate aftermath of dust-up crackdowns and suggested my 38% was top-heavy for this interval. While the risk is higher than the historic peacetime average (the Sahel remains volatile and a single success would not be shocking), realistic assessment of coup-fatigue, plotter risk aversion, and the power dynamic shift point to a recalibration.

Those arguing for figures in the 30s or 40s overstate the likelihood that major crackdowns, heightened vigilance, and foreign security support will be rapidly circumvented in just six weeks; the historical record and current elite dynamics both suggest a short-term lull post-crackdown.

These forces are part of the Russian 'Africa Corps,' subordinated to the Russian Ministry of Defense, with most soldiers having previously participated in the 'special military operation' in Ukraine. The presence includes military equipment such as aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles, along with Wagner Group flags. The Wagner Group, which was dissolved after the death of its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in a mysterious plane crash in August 2023, has been reorganized into a formal military unit. The group has been accused of severe human rights violations in Mali, including the abduction, detention, torture, and killing of hundreds of civilians between 2022 and 2024. A May 2025 investigation by the journalist network Forbidden Stories, based on testimonies from Malian refugees in Mauritania, documented six locations where Wagner operatives held civilians, including former UN bases. Torture methods included waterboarding, beatings, and cigarette burns, with victims reporting similarities to abuses in Ukraine. The Wagner Group has also provided military training, political advisory services, and security for leaders in Mali, where a military junta led by General Assimi Goita has ruled since 2020 and shifted allegiance from France to Russia.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Kreml-soll-Truppen-in-sechs-afrikanischen-Laendern-stationiert-haben-id30033579.html)\n\n**Benin Revises Constitution to Extend Terms and Create Senate Amid Political Controversy**\nThe National Assembly of Benin adopted a comprehensive constitutional revision early Saturday morning after a long night of deliberation. The new text establishes a Senate and extends presidential, parliamentary, and mayoral terms from five to seven years. According to La Nation, this reform will take effect starting with the next general elections, meaning it does not apply to President Patrice Talon\u2019s current term, which ends in May 2026. The presidential movement claims the revision aims to strengthen institutional stability, transparency, and democratic vitality. However, concerns persist: La Nouvelle Tribune notes that while the reform is framed as a move toward political calm and development, critics argue it may deepen political fractures and discourage opposition participation. The main opposition party, the D\u00e9mocrates, was excluded from local and presidential elections due to insufficient endorsements, raising suspicions about the process. Aujourd'hui reports that Talon, stepping down after his second term, is reshaping the political landscape in favor of his chosen successor, Romuald Wadagni, who now faces no significant challenger. The Pays, a Burkinab\u00e9 outlet, questions the timing of the reform, suggesting it is a politically calculated maneuver to entrench Talon\u2019s system, neutralize weakened opposition, and shield the elite from judicial accountability. The extension of mandates to seven years is seen as reducing political pluralism and diminishing electoral frequency, effectively locking in the current power structure. The creation of a Senate, where members are appointed or automatically included\u2014such as former presidents\u2014is viewed as a strategic move to ensure lifelong political privilege. Ledjely from Guinea highlights that the reform, despite initial optimism over Talon\u2019s pledge not to seek a third term, now appears to undermine democratic progress, especially given the exclusion of opposition figures and the continued detention of political prisoners like Reckya Madougou.

It claims that ECOWAS ordered the Niger junta to restore democratic rule, prompting a warning from other West African military regimes that any forceful intervention would be viewed as war and provoke retaliation. The article frames the situation as a potential continental conflict, suggesting Africa is heading toward internal warfare. It references Primate Elijah Ayodele, a self-proclaimed prophet, who in January 2023 and February 2023 foretold a 'mysterious attack' on Africa, describing it as an unexplainable crisis, widespread insecurity, and a war between African nations. Ayodele also warned that the presence of foreign powers\u2014such as China, Russia, the U.S., the UK, and Israel\u2014could turn Africa into a geopolitical testing ground. The article concludes by posing the question: 'Will it be right to say Africa is coming under a mysterious attack as foretold by Primate Ayodele?' The claims are presented without independent verification, relying solely on the prophet\u2019s statements and current geopolitical developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 02, 2023 09:18 AM\nSource:[topcelebrities.com.ng](https://topcelebrities.com.ng/is-africa-coming-under-mysterious-attacks-as-primate-ayodele-foretold/)\n\n**The Blogs: Mali: Al-Qaeda's Next Fallen State**\nAl-Qaeda has not been defeated but has repositioned itself from Afghanistan to Africa, with Mali on the brink of becoming the terror network's most significant resurgence in a generation. According to the article, after France's withdrawal in 2022 and the UN's departure in 2023, Al-Qaeda's local affiliate, Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), systematically filled the power vacuum in Mali, dismantling state authority, enforcing sharia, taxing populations, and encircling the capital Bamako by 2025. This marks Mali as the third country in a generation to fall under Islamist rule, following Afghanistan under the Taliban and Syria under HTS. The article frames this not as a sudden collapse but as a methodical construction of a jihadist proto-state. Al-Qaeda has reconstituted a pan-African insurgent network across Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia, Mozambique, Libya, Algeria, Sudan, and Chad, creating a transcontinental ecosystem stronger than its Middle East presence. The U.S. drone campaign has constrained but not eliminated Al-Qaeda\u2019s Yemeni branch (AQAP), which could gain a sanctuary if Mali falls. A jihadist-controlled Mali would collapse Africa\u2019s security architecture, enable a contiguous jihadist corridor from Mauritania to Somalia, and destabilize North Africa, threatening Israel\u2019s intelligence and counterterrorism alliances. It would also empower Iran\u2019s proxies, trigger a new migration wave into Europe, and erase the West\u2019s strategic foothold in the Sahel. The article concludes that Mali\u2019s fall would mark the beginning of a new jihadist era, not in Kabul or Raqqa, but in Africa\u2019s overlooked expanses where Al-Qaeda has quietly prepared its most dangerous resurrection.

These forces are part of the Russian 'Africa Corps,' subordinated to the Russian Ministry of Defense, with most soldiers having previously participated in the 'special military operation' in Ukraine. The presence includes military equipment such as aircraft, helicopters, and armored vehicles, along with Wagner Group flags. The Wagner Group, which was dissolved after the death of its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in a mysterious plane crash in August 2023, has been reorganized into a formal military unit. The group has been accused of severe human rights violations in Mali, including the abduction, detention, torture, and killing of hundreds of civilians between 2022 and 2024. A May 2025 investigation by the journalist network Forbidden Stories, based on testimonies from Malian refugees in Mauritania, documented six locations where Wagner operatives held civilians, including former UN bases. Torture methods included waterboarding, beatings, and cigarette burns, with victims reporting similarities to abuses in Ukraine. The Wagner Group has also provided military training, political advisory services, and security for leaders in Mali, where a military junta led by General Assimi Goita has ruled since 2020 and shifted allegiance from France to Russia.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 08:07 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Kreml-soll-Truppen-in-sechs-afrikanischen-Laendern-stationiert-haben-id30033579.html)\n\n**Russian Military Active in Six African Countries, State TV Reports**\nAccording to a report by Russia's state television, the Russian military is active in six African countries, marking a rare official acknowledgment of Moscow's military presence on the continent. This expansion comes amid Western isolation following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, prompting Moscow to strengthen its political, economic, and military ties with African nations in recent years. A state TV correspondent reported on Sunday that Russian military officers and soldiers are operating in six African countries, though the specific nations were not named except for Mali. Reports indicate the deployment of additional Russian troops or military trainers in Burkina Faso, Niger, Equatorial Guinea, the Central African Republic, and Libya. The African Corps, a unit linked to Russia's Ministry of Defense, has taken over the roles previously held by the Wagner Group, a private military company, across Africa, according to diplomatic sources in the Sahel region. The Wagner Group was dismantled and restructured after the mysterious plane crash that killed its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, in August 2023, following a brief rebellion against Moscow. Wagner forces had previously fought in Ukraine and were deployed across Africa. The state TV report confirmed the African Corps is under Russia's Ministry of Defense and stated that most deployed personnel are 'veterans of the special military operation'\u2014Russia\u2019s term for the war in Ukraine. Footage from the report showed a flag resembling Wagner\u2019s skull emblem at a base in Mali, as well as Russian Su-25 aircraft conducting airstrikes and heavy Russian military equipment, including helicopters and armored personnel carriers. Moscow claims its forces are helping African governments combat extremist insurgencies.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 03:33 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5209797)\n\n**Azhar Observatory: Rise in Terrorist Activity in West Africa During October 2025, but with Decline in Civilian Casualties and Kidnappings**\nThe Azhar Observatory reported a rise in terrorist activities in West Africa during October 2025, with 4 attacks in Nigeria, 1 in Niger, and none in Senegal or Benin. Despite the increase in operations, civilian casualties dropped significantly from 141 in September to 74 in October\u2014a 52.5% decrease\u2014and kidnappings fell from 45 to 5, a reduction of nearly 89%. Injuries totaled 35 in October, compared to zero in September, indicating a shift from large-scale massacres to limited or targeted attacks. Nigeria remained the epicenter, with Boko Haram and ISWAP (Islamic State West Africa Province) continuing to operate, though with reduced casualties. Niger recorded only one attack with no fatalities, signaling improved border security following intensified joint operations with Nigeria and Chad. Senegal and Benin reported no terrorist activity, reflecting continued relative stability in the Gulf of Guinea region. The October data marked a strategic shift from September\u2019s pattern of killing 100 terrorists without arrests, toward more precise operations combining on-the-ground neutralization and intelligence-led arrests. The increase in military operations, neutralization rates, and arrests reflects improved security coordination among Sahel countries and Nigeria, particularly through the West African Sahel Group. The Azhar Observatory emphasized the need to strengthen early warning systems, border surveillance, intelligence sharing, regional cooperation, and rehabilitation programs to combat radicalization, especially in northern Nigeria and eastern Burkina Faso.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[cairo24.com](https://www.cairo24.com/2319396)\n\n**Benin Revises Constitution to Extend Terms and Create Senate Amid Political Controversy**\nThe National Assembly of Benin adopted a comprehensive constitutional revision early Saturday morning after a long night of deliberation. The new text establishes a Senate and extends presidential, parliamentary, and mayoral terms from five to seven years. According to La Nation, this reform will take effect starting with the next general elections, meaning it does not apply to President Patrice Talon\u2019s current term, which ends in May 2026. The presidential movement claims the revision aims to strengthen institutional stability, transparency, and democratic vitality. However, concerns persist: La Nouvelle Tribune notes that while the reform is framed as a move toward political calm and development, critics argue it may deepen political fractures and discourage opposition participation. The main opposition party, the D\u00e9mocrates, was excluded from local and presidential elections due to insufficient endorsements, raising suspicions about the process. Aujourd'hui reports that Talon, stepping down after his second term, is reshaping the political landscape in favor of his chosen successor, Romuald Wadagni, who now faces no significant challenger. The Pays, a Burkinab\u00e9 outlet, questions the timing of the reform, suggesting it is a politically calculated maneuver to entrench Talon\u2019s system, neutralize weakened opposition, and shield the elite from judicial accountability. The extension of mandates to seven years is seen as reducing political pluralism and diminishing electoral frequency, effectively locking in the current power structure. The creation of a Senate, where members are appointed or automatically included\u2014such as former presidents\u2014is viewed as a strategic move to ensure lifelong political privilege. Ledjely from Guinea highlights that the reform, despite initial optimism over Talon\u2019s pledge not to seek a third term, now appears to undermine democratic progress, especially given the exclusion of opposition figures and the continued detention of political prisoners like Reckya Madougou. The overall outcome suggests a democratic victory that may be more illusory than real.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 07:36 AM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/podcasts/revue-de-presse-afrique/20251117-%C3%A0-la-une-le-b%C3%A9nin-r%C3%A9vise-sa-constitution)\n\n**Guinea-Bissau\u2019s presidential poll failed credibility test**\nGuinea-Bissau\u2019s upcoming presidential election on 23 November 2025 has failed a credibility test, according to social scientists analyzing the country\u2019s deepening democratic erosion. The article highlights a regional crisis across Africa, citing fraudulent elections in Cameroon (where 92-year-old Paul Biya won 53.7% amid widespread allegations of fraud), Tanzania (where President Samia Suluhu Hassan claimed 98% of votes in a poll met with unprecedented protests and a crackdown), and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire (where President Alassane Ouattara secured a fourth term with nearly 90% of the vote, despite a constitutional two-term limit). These outcomes have fueled public cynicism and weakened democratic norms. In Guinea-Bissau, President Umar Sissoco Embalo has undermined electoral legitimacy through repeated constitutional manipulations: he assumed office in February 2020 despite a pending legal challenge, dissolved parliament in May 2022 and again in December 2023, and delayed legislative elections until late 2024 due to alleged logistical issues. The supreme court, after its chief judge fled citing death threats, declined to rule on the 2020 dispute, leading to Ecowas recognition of Embalo\u2019s government. Embalo initially pledged not to seek re-election but reversed course in March 2025. A mediation team from Ecowas withdrew after threats of expulsion. Most critically, the PAIGC\u2014the country\u2019s oldest and most influential party\u2014was barred from the presidential race after its candidate, Domingos Simoes Pereira, was rejected by the supreme court for late document submission, marking the first time in history the party has been excluded from a presidential election. Guinea-Bissau\u2019s Electoral Democracy Index from V-Dem has declined sharply, even surpassing drops seen after past coups and assassinations. The article argues that Embalo\u2019s tactics\u2014removing viable opponents, manipulating timelines, using the security sector coercively, and weakening judicial independence\u2014mirror regional patterns of hollowing out elections without abolishing them. The 2025 election risks reversing decades of fragile democratic progress, illustrating how performative elections can entrench power while eroding accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[newsdrum.in](https://www.newsdrum.in/international/guinea-bissaus-presidential-poll-failed-credibility-test-10781223)\n\n**Teams Already Eliminated from the 2026 World Cup Qualifications**\nAs of November 15, 2025, numerous national teams have been officially eliminated from the qualification process for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which began in September 2023 and will conclude in March 2026.

The event, hosted at the Alioune Blondin Beye Peacekeeping School, aimed to strengthen security and military cooperation in the Sahel region and promote new defense sector partnerships. Prominent Turkish companies including Baykar, Aselsan, Roketsan, and Otokar participated, showcasing advanced technologies such as drones and radar systems, underscoring Ankara\u2019s growing defense influence in Africa through agreements with Mali and other Sahel Alliance (AES) members. The exhibition also attracted participation from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Russia, which reaffirmed its support for Mali in counterterrorism efforts. Social media and activists highlighted the event as a 'slap' to Algerian and French media narratives predicting Bamako\u2019s collapse, emphasizing that the successful organization of the exhibition proves the capital\u2019s stability and strategic attractiveness for military investment. The 'Ak\u0131nc\u0131' drone displayed at the exhibition was noted as part of the Turkish-Malian defense agreement and had recently been shot down during operations.

Amid this political chaos, religious leaders\u2014such as Cardinal Philippe Ou\u00e9draogo of Burkina Faso, Imam Mahmoud Dicko of Mali, and Islamic leaders in Niger\u2014have emerged as key stabilizing figures. They have consistently advocated for dialogue, restraint, and national unity, using their moral authority to de-escalate tensions and prevent violence. In Burkina Faso, Ou\u00e9draogo urged a national conversation after two coups in 2022, while in Mali, Dicko played a dual role as both a protest voice and a mediator during the 2020 uprising. In Niger, Islamic leaders framed resistance to foreign military intervention as a moral defense of sovereignty. In Guinea and Gabon, clergy called for accountability and peace after military takeovers. Though not universally trusted\u2014some are criticized for silence or proximity to power\u2014their influence persists where formal institutions have failed. Their sermons and homilies often carry more public resonance than government statements. Despite challenges, including ongoing jihadist violence displacing millions in Burkina Faso and Mali, faith leaders remain among the last civic anchors in fragile states. Their role may diminish if military regimes consolidate power, but in transitional moments, they could still shape the region\u2019s future governance.

Over forty military personnel, including a brigadier general, a colonel, and several majors, were detained by the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) following raids in late October 2025, with the Abuja residence of former Bayelsa State Governor Timipre Sylva raided on October 29, 2025. His brother was arrested during the operation. Sylva, reportedly abroad for a medical check-up in the UK and a conference in Malaysia, is alleged to have fled Nigeria via the creeks to Senegal and then to Argentina, where he is said to have business interests. Investigators reportedly traced \u20a646 billion to an account linked to him, funds suspected of financing the coup plot\u2014though these claims remain unconfirmed by the government. While the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) described the operation as a 'routine internal disciplinary investigation,' credible reports from Premium Times and PRNigeria indicate a broader conspiracy involving mid- to senior-level officers planning to neutralize key political figures, including the vice president, Senate president, and speaker of the House of Representatives. This incident follows a regional trend of military coups in West Africa, including in Mali (2020, 2021), Guinea (2021), Burkina Faso (2022), Niger (2023), and Gabon (2023). Nigeria\u2019s history includes multiple coups since independence in 1960, such as the 1966 counter-coup, the 1983 coup that ousted Shehu Shagari, and the 1985 coup that brought Ibrahim Babangida to power. The article argues that the alleged coup reflects deeper institutional issues: low military morale, inadequate welfare, political interference, and growing distrust. It warns that the real threat to democracy lies not in overt military force but in systemic neglect and public despair. The author urges President Tinubu to treat the incident not merely as a criminal matter but as a warning to rebuild trust, improve transparency, and restore military morale\u2014essential acts for national preservation. The piece concludes that democracy must be actively sustained through justice, inclusion, and accountability, especially as West Africa faces democratic decline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 07:15 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@johnogunpitan17/nigerias-2025-coup-scare-everything-you-need-to-know-by-anjolaoluwa-ogunpitan-3cdcba69c2ba)\n\n**The Jihadist Conundrum in the Sahel**\nThe article analyzes the escalating jihadist insurgency in the Sahel region, particularly in Mali, following the French withdrawal in July 2022 after the Malian military coup led by President Assimi Goita. Since then, Russian Wagner Group and the Africa Corps have replaced French forces, but their military support\u2014though including hardware, training, and access to mineral resources like gold, lithium, and uranium\u2014has failed to contain the rise of Islamist insurgents, particularly Jama'at Nasrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an Al-Qaeda-linked group. Insurgent attacks surged from 1,900 in 2019 to over 5,500 in 2024, with 3,800 attacks recorded by October 10, 2025, resulting in 76,900 deaths since 2019, 56% of which occurred in Mali and Burkina Faso. The Malian junta\u2019s propaganda of military success has been exposed as a facade, with major attacks on military outposts and increasing control loss in rural areas. The junta\u2019s human rights violations and reliance on foreign military contractors have undermined legitimacy. A new tactic by JNIM in August 2025\u2014targeting fuel imports from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Mauritania, and Guinea\u2014has caused a severe fuel crisis in Bamako, closing schools and universities. Foreign companies, including seven Chinese and three Indian nationals, were kidnapped in July 2025, highlighting the fragility of the economy. The U.S. Embassy has issued an 'immediate departure' advisory due to deteriorating security. The article warns that without urgent counter-insurgency reforms\u2014including professional chain-of-command, village protection, local cooperation, internal purges of corrupt officers, and regional coordination with ECOWAS\u2014the fall of Bamako is imminent. The risk of a state collapse similar to ISIS in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan looms, threatening regional stability across Burkina Faso and Niger.

On 26 July 2023, Niger's military removed President Mohamed Bazoum, installing General Abdourahamane Tiani as leader; ECOWAS responded with plans to deploy a regional force to restore constitutional order, while the junta proposed a maximum three-year transition. Burkina Faso saw two coups in less than a year: President Roch Marc Christian Kabor\u00e9 was ousted on 24 January 2022, replaced by Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who was himself overthrown on 30 September by Captain Ibrahim Traor\u00e9, who now leads a transitional government with elections scheduled for July 2024. Sudan\u2019s democratic transition collapsed on 25 October 2021 when General Abdel Fattah al-Burhane removed civilian leaders; since 15 April 2023, a deadly conflict between Burhane and his former deputy Mohamed Hamdane Daglo has caused at least 5,000 deaths. Guinea\u2019s President Alpha Cond\u00e9 was overthrown on 5 September 2021, with Colonel Mamady Doumbouya assuming power on 1 October, pledging to return to civilian rule by the end of 2024. Mali\u2019s President Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta was ousted on 18 August 2020, leading to a transitional government; on 24 May 2021, the military arrested both the president and prime minister, and Colonel Assimi Go\u00efta became transitional president in June, with elections planned for February 2024. Madagascar was listed among affected countries, but details of a successful military takeover remain unclear. Nigeria, though not listed as having a recent coup, has a history of military rule since independence in 1960; researchers note that the military\u2019s economic policies in the 1980s led to 45% of foreign-exchange earnings being used for debt servicing, resulting in minimal growth, widespread poverty, and long-term instability.

According to the joint statement released by the three military\u2011governed states, the ICC has proven \"incapable of investigating and prosecuting proven war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and aggression\".  The leaders of the three countries, which have close ties to Russia, also said they intend to establish \"local mechanisms for strengthening peace and justice\".  They criticised the ICC for the fact that, out of the 33 cases opened since its founding, all but one involved African states.  The withdrawal will take effect one year after the countries submit a notice to the UN Secretary\u2011General.  The three West African states, which came to power through coups between 2020 and 2023, joined forces in 2023 to form the Sahel Alliance, later renamed the Confederation of Sahel Countries, and cooperate with the Russian Federation.  Their armies have been accused of committing war crimes against civilians during operations against jihadist groups linked to Al\u2011Qaeda and the Islamic State.  In March 2023 the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on charges of war crimes, including the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children and the forced relocation of Ukrainians to Russia.  The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry recently condemned the \"illegal visit\" of the ambassadors of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger to the Russian\u2011occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 23, 2025 09:28 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-world/4039447-niger-mali-ta-burkinafaso-ogolosili-pro-vihid-iz-miznarodnogo-kriminalnogo-sudu.html)\n\n**Africa: Francophone Press Review of September\u00a01,\u00a02025**\nThe press review for September\u00a01,\u00a02025 covers a range of African news items. It reports that the African Development Bank (BAD) inaugurated a new president, 'Sidi Ould Tah', who was elected on 29\u00a0May with 76.18\u202f% of the vote and becomes the first Mauritanian to hold the post. In Gabon, lieutenant Kelly Ondo\u2011Obiang was released from the central prison in Libreville after seven years of detention; his release follows an amnesty ordinance issued on 12\u00a0August\u00a02025 that pardons all participants in the January\u00a02019 and August\u00a02023 coup attempts. Cameroon\u2019s military court in Yaound\u00e9 held a hearing on 1\u00a0September concerning the death of radio host Martinez Zogo, who was abducted on 17\u00a0January\u00a02023 and found dead five days later. South Africa\u2019s Comic\u2011Con Africa concluded its sixth edition in Johannesburg, drawing tens of thousands of fans for a four\u2011day festival of comics, anime, video games and cosplay. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, a political meeting in Yamoussoukro sold more than 10\u202f000 tickets, marking a first for the country\u2019s political gatherings. Morocco celebrated a historic third CHAN title after a 3\u20112 win over Madagascar; striker Oussama Lamlaoui scored twice, including a 40\u2011meter goal, and finished as the tournament\u2019s top scorer with six goals. Benin\u2019s Romuald Wadagni has been named the presidential candidate for the 2026 election, potentially triggering a cabinet reshuffle. Togo announced a strengthened university partnership with India, aiming to expand scholarship opportunities for students. Mali\u2019s transition, five years after the 18\u00a0August\u00a02020 coup, is described as a period of challenge and renewal, with the country regaining sovereignty over nearly 70\u202f% of its territory. Senegal\u2019s sports minister Khady Di\u00e8ne Gaye set a dual objective for new coach Pape Thiaw: qualify the national team for the 2026 World Cup and win the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 01, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[allAfrica.fr](https://fr.allafrica.com/stories/202509010140.html)\n\n**Mali and Burkina Faso Boycott African Defence Summit in Nigeria**\nMali and Burkina Faso, both part of the newly formed Alliance des \u00c9tats du Sahel (AES), withdrew from the African Chiefs of Defence Summit in Abuja, Nigeria, in January, following their exit from the West African Economic and Monetary Union (Cedeao). Only Niger, represented by Colonel Soumana Kalkoye, the defence attach\u00e9 at the Nigerien embassy in Abuja, attended the summit. The conference, which ran until 27\u202fAugust, brought senior officers from most African states to 'discuter de strat\u00e9gies collectives' and to 'trouver des solutions locales aux besoins de l'Afrique en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9fense', according to the summit programme. Nigerian Chief of Staff Christopher\u202fMusa highlighted that security challenges 'ne connaissent pas de fronti\u00e8res' and called for 'une nouvelle architecture de coop\u00e9ration en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, dirig\u00e9e par l'Afrique', adding that 'La v\u00e9ritable s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne s'obtient pas dans l'isolement'. Relations between Niger and Nigeria had deteriorated after the 2023 coup in Niamey, when the Cedeao imposed sanctions on Niger and threatened a military intervention to restore President Mohamed\u202fBazoum. The tensions eased in 2024 when the two countries signed a security memorandum, but Niger\u2019s withdrawal from the regional military force has hampered cross\u2011border operations against jihadists around Lake Chad. The juntas in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have seen their military cooperation with neighbours such as Benin, which is trying to repel Sahel armed groups, deteriorate.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 26, 2025 08:25 AM\nSource:[JeuneAfrique.com](https://www.jeuneafrique.com/1716916/politique/le-mali-et-le-burkina-faso-boycottent-le-sommet-africain-sur-la-defense-organise-au-nigeria/)\n\n**Sahel Crisis: Why Military Regimes in Mali, Niger and Burkina\u202fFaso May Fail**\nThe article reports that the military governments in Mali, Burkina\u202fFaso and Niger are losing popular support as security deteriorates and the economy falters.  Since the coups in 2020\u20132021, the armed forces have failed to improve the fragile security situation; instead, Islamist insurgents and other rebels have taken control of more territory.  Within the armies, disagreements over strategy and the transition to a democratic government have surfaced, according to political analyst Beverly\u202fOchieng of Control\u202fRisks.  In Mali, a failed coup in August 2024 led to the arrest of dozens of soldiers, including two prominent generals and a French officer accused of mobilising civilians for the French intelligence service; the French foreign ministry dismissed the allegations as \"completely unfounded\".  Ochieng notes that the coup attempt shows the regime\u2019s attempt to pre\u2011empt internal dissent.  Since the 2021 coup, Mali\u2019s junta has ended the UN mission, expelled France and brought in Russian paramilitaries, while repeatedly facing accusations of serious human\u2011rights violations from the UN and NGOs.  In August 2024, a protest in the village of Diafarab\u00e9 over alleged mass killings by the army prompted the dismissal of the local governor, who was later arrested on charges of \"destabilising the state\".  Economic hardship, new taxes and the dissolution of political parties have sparked further protests, which were violently suppressed.  The three countries left ECOWAS in 2023 and formed the Sahel Alliance (AES), which lacks access to a port and relies on neighbouring coastal states, contributing to rising prices and frequent power outages.  In Burkina\u202fFaso, the young president Ibrahim\u202fTraor\u00e9 faces criticism within the army because of his low rank and the potential expansion of Islamist influence; in Niger, mutinies have been reported after military defeats against Islamist militias.  Ochieng warns that a future coup in any of the three states is more likely to prolong the status quo than to accelerate a return to democracy, as each new junta will focus on consolidating its own power.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: August 23, 2025 03:30 AM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https://www.nzz.ch/international/militaerregierungen-im-sahel-unter-druck-risse-in-armee-und-bevoelkerung-ld.1898767)\n\n**Africa: Review of Francophone Africa News - July 28, 2025**\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been hit by an attack on a Catholic church in the north-east of the country by the rebel group ADF, affiliated with the Islamic State. The attack has resulted in at least 43 deaths, according to a new UN report. The ADF has killed thousands of civilians and committed numerous crimes in the north-east of the DRC despite the deployment of the Ugandan army (UPDF) alongside the Congolese armed forces (FARDC). In Cameroon, the rejection of Maurice Kamto's presidential candidacy has sparked controversy. Although his candidacy was not authenticated, audio recordings that have gone viral on the internet suggest that there was a plot to exclude him from the presidential election. In the Central African Republic, President Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra has announced his candidacy for a third term in the presidential election in December 2025. He is relying on the new constitution adopted in 2023 to extend his rule. In the US, Washington has suspended the issuance of visas to Niger. The reasons for this decision are not specified, but the suspension will remain in place until Washington resolves its 'concerns with the government of Niger'. In Madagascar, the country has failed to make it to the top 50 of the Africa's Business Heroes (ABH) 2025 competition for the first time since 2021. The competition, initiated by Alibaba Philanthropy, has seen a record number of 32,000 applications from 54 African countries. In Mali, former Prime Minister Choguel Ma\u00efga is under investigation for the misuse of public funds. In C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, a king has warned of the country's political situation ahead of the presidential election in October. In Abidjan, the capital of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the 27th edition of the Afrobasket women's basketball tournament is taking place, featuring 12 national teams. In Burkina Faso, a Burkinab\u00e9 activist has died in prison in Abidjan. In the Sudan, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the creation of a parallel government in the areas under their control, with Mohamed Hassan Al-Ta'ayshi as the head of the 'government of peace and unity'.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: July 28, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[allAfrica.fr](https://fr.allafrica.com/stories/202507280137.html)\n\n**Is Africa Coming Under Mysterious Attacks As Primate Ayodele Foretold?**\nThe article discusses rising political instability across Africa, citing recent military coups in Niger Republic and an attempted coup in Sierra Leone, as well as regional tensions involving the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and military juntas in Burkina Faso, Guinea Bissau, and Mali. It claims that ECOWAS ordered the Niger junta to restore democratic rule, prompting a warning from other West African military regimes that any forceful intervention would be viewed as war and provoke retaliation. The article frames the situation as a potential continental conflict, suggesting Africa is heading toward internal warfare. It references Primate Elijah Ayodele, a self-proclaimed prophet, who in January 2023 and February 2023 foretold a 'mysterious attack' on Africa, describing it as an unexplainable crisis, widespread insecurity, and a war between African nations. Ayodele also warned that the presence of foreign powers\u2014such as China, Russia, the U.S., the UK, and Israel\u2014could turn Africa into a geopolitical testing ground. The article concludes by posing the question: 'Will it be right to say Africa is coming under a mysterious attack as foretold by Primate Ayodele?' The claims are presented without independent verification, relying solely on the prophet\u2019s statements and current geopolitical developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 02, 2023 09:18 AM\nSource:[topcelebrities.com.ng](https://topcelebrities.com.ng/is-africa-coming-under-mysterious-attacks-as-primate-ayodele-foretold/)\n\n**Niger adds to growing list of countries in the Sahel run by the military**\nThe Associated Press reports that mutinous soldiers in Niger overthrew President Mohamed Bazoum\u2019s democratically elected government, adding Niger to a growing list of military regimes in West Africa\u2019s Sahel. The coup follows a pattern in which soldiers accuse civilian leaders of failing to deliver democratic dividends, promising a new government that is delayed in practice.  Karim Manuel, a West\u2011and\u2011Central Africa analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit, warned that such military takeovers \"increase political instability going forward and make the situation on the ground much more volatile and unpredictable,\" thereby undermining regional stability.  The Sahel region\u2014comprising Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Nigeria\u2014now hosts several military regimes: Mali (2020 coup, 2024 constitution referendum), Burkina Faso (2022 coup, July 2024 election goal), Sudan (2021 coup, ongoing civil conflict), and Chad (2021 coup, 18\u2011month transition extended).  The article also notes that over 90% of Guineans support a referendum that could allow the junta leader to run for president.

    "summary": "The panel of experts broadly agrees that, while Africa\u2014particularly in the Sahel region\u2014remains at elevated risk for successful coups, the overall probability of a successful coup (classic or self-coup) before January 1, 2026 is lower than during the peak coup wave of 2020\u20132023, but still materially above long-term historical averages. Most experts situate the highest risk within specific African countries like Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea-Bissau, and, to a lesser extent, Benin and Central African Republic, based on persistent regime fragility, elite splits, legitimacy crises, ongoing jihadist insurgencies, and a recent pattern of coup attempts and purges. Latin America is broadly assessed as substantially less likely to experience a successful coup in this time frame, given stronger institutional barriers and recent failed coup attempts. \n\nKey factors increasing the probability include high coup base rates in the Sahel, entrenched military regimes with internal fissures, legitimacy deficits, ongoing insurgencies, and election-related or elite succession crises. These risks are partially offset by recent and ongoing coup-proofing efforts, such as purges of suspected plotters, increased repression, heavy reliance on Russian (Africa Corps) and Turkish security support, and the short time window remaining (about six weeks). Several experts note that successful coups often cluster and can be contagious regionally, but also highlight that most at-risk regimes have recently survived attempted coups and remain on high alert.\n\nThe most common 'No' scenario is that existing African juntas maintain control through surveillance, purges, and foreign backing, foiling any nascent plots before they can succeed, while Latin America remains stable despite some underlying tensions. The most plausible 'Yes' scenario is an internal military split or elite fracture resulting in a rapid, successful 'palace coup' within an already unstable junta-ruled state, or, more rarely, a self-coup or rushed elite takeover in a fragile democracy during a political or security crisis.\n\nForecast probabilities cluster in the 13%\u201343% range, with most estimates between 23% and 34%, reflecting current warning indicators balanced by successful regime adaptation and the limited resolution window. Outliers include the highest forecast (43%) emphasizing coup contagion in regional security complexes and the lowest (13%) emphasizing coup-proofing and the short time frame. The aggregate expert consensus is that the risk of at least one successful coup in Africa or Latin America before January 1, 2026 is well above zero but remains below a coin flip, driven primarily by continued instability and elite fragmentation in Francophone Sahelian Africa.",
