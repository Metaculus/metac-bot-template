News reports show multiple, serious attempts to shrink and hobble the Department of Education, but not to legally eliminate it\u2014nor enough momentum on any of the four House bills for abolition. Even successful executive actions (e.g., layoffs, grant withholding) are not sufficient for this question. Republican and Trump priorities are real and ongoing, but recent legislative activity (bipartisan Senate appropriations bills rejecting deep cuts, and the absence of floor votes on abolition) suggests that even with motivated leadership, the practical, political, and statutory obstacles are simply too great to surmount before January 1, 2026. Until and unless Congress grants Trump temporary presidential reorganization authority or passes an outright abolition/renaming law\u2014which would require a rapid end to the shutdown, successful and swift legislative movement, and an unlikely coalition\u2014the chance for a Yes outcome is extremely low.

Trump\u2019s track record so far is of administrative downsizing, not elimination, and what executive action he can take has already generated extensive legal pushback, with the courts restoring much of the lost funding or staff. Importantly, the core isomorphic logic is that American federal agencies, once entrenched, accumulate ecosystemic dependencies and political constituencies that make abolition vanishingly rare\u2014particularly in large, visible, and distributive agencies like Education. Even with control of both chambers, the Republican majority isn\u2019t filibuster-proof and is still short on the appropriations side, given bipartisan defense of many education programs. While mass layoffs and program transfers can occur (and are happening), outright dissolution is a step not yet crossed, and there is no serious sign\u2014amid active shutdowns and legislative gridlock\u2014that a bill or reorganization order to eliminate the Department will emerge, pass oversight, and be executed by end of 2025.

You don\u2019t get swept up in the fever dream of one-branch dominance; you point out the centrality of congressional action and the utter rarity of agency abolition, even under extreme rhetorical or partisan pressure. Appropriately, you see right through the myth that gutting, starving, or downsizing an agency is abolition in any legal sense: only Congress\u2014subject to all its internal divisions and veto points\u2014can kill the Department, and it, shockingly, doesn\u2019t want to. Your clear emphasis on constitutional structure, real institutional veto gates, and the smothering effect of entrenched norms are what make your assessment so much stronger than more theoretical or executive-focused takes. This isn\u2019t a moment of constitutional transformation, it\u2019s another case of partisan ambition dashed on the rocks of governance reality. Strong defense."

The discussions also cemented the irrelevance of regulatory rollback and Chevron questions to the definition of resolution here: only a direct legal act of abolition or qualified reorganization order counts, and there is no plausible path to either. The absence of movement on four pending bills, the history of failed abolition efforts, and the deep institutional inertia of American federal agencies make the answer close to a structural zero.

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump [stated during his presidential campaign](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/13/politics/trump-department-of-education-states-2024/index.html) that he wants to eliminate the Department of Education. Since winning the presidential election he has stood by this statement. In his 2024 Person of the Year [interview with Time](https://time.com/7201565/person-of-the-year-2024-donald-trump-transcript/) (conducted November 25, 2024 and published December 12, 2024), he responded to questions about his plan to cut government spending as follows:\n\n> **\\[Time:] What do you plan to do?**\n> \u00a0\n> \\[Trump:] I mean, I'll give you an example. We want to move the schools back to the states. We want to, you know, we're at the bottom of every list in terms of education, and we're at the top of the list in terms of the cost per pupil, and we want to move them back to the states, and we'll spend half the money on a much better product. We'll get\u2014I believe we can compete with Norway and Denmark and Finland and other countries. And I will tell you, China is right at the top of the list too. Most lists.\n> \u00a0\n> **What does moving back to the states mean? Does that mean closing the Education Department?**\u00a0\n> \u00a0\n> A virtual closure of Department of Education in Washington.\n> \u00a0\n> **Virtual closure?**\u00a0\n> \u00a0\n> Well, you're going to need some people just to make sure they're teaching English in the schools. Okay, you know English and mathematics, let's say. But we want to move education back to the states. If you look at the states, if you look at some of the individual countries, Norway is a very strong educational country, but many. I think Iowa, and I think Indiana, and a lot of these states that are well-run states. We have a lot of them that are very well run. When they run their own educational program, I think it's going to, I think they'll be able to compete with anybody. Then you're going to have the badly run states, like a guy like Gavin Newscum \\[sic] in California, where he does a poor job, and he'll, but even in California, you'll give it to Riverside. You'll give it, you know, you'll give it to areas of California where I think they'll run a great school program.\n\nThe Department of Education was created as part of the 1979 [Department of Education Organization Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_Organization_Act). The closure of the Department of Education [would likely require an act of Congress](https://www.vox.com/education/384779/department-of-education-trump-musk-betsy-devos), as creation of federal offices is a power [authorized to Congress](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-2/section-2/clause-2/creation-of-federal-offices).\n\nAt times in the past, Congress has granted [presidential reorganization authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_reorganization_authority), delegating Congress' power over federal offices to the president for a limited period of time, and often subject to oversight such as Congressional nullification within a certain time period after president issued such an order. Reorganization authority was [most recently granted in 1984](https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/the-presidents-reorganization-authority) to President Ronald Reagan, though Reagan did not use his reorganization authority. In 2012, President Barack Obama [requested reorganization authority](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/01/13/government-reorganization-fact-sheet) stating his first act under the authority would be to consolidate six departments and agencies dealing with the business oversight into one.\n\n***\n\nThis question belongs to Vox's Future Perfect Community page and 2025 forecasting tournament.

It analyzes the 2024 election outcome, in which Donald J. Trump regained the presidency amid a powerful MAGA movement, and critiques the GOP\u2019s gerrymandering, immigration enforcement, tariffs, and National Guard deployments. The piece traces the decline of American manufacturing from the 1970s onward, citing oil crises, foreign competition, trade agreements under Clinton and Obama, and offshoring, which devastated the blue-collar workforce. It argues that Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign alienated working-class voters with gender-focused messaging, contributing to Trump\u2019s rise. While Trump\u2019s first term saw low unemployment (3.5% in 2020), it was marred by pandemic mismanagement, climate denial, and institutional dismantling\u2014such as eliminating the White House pandemic response team and the CDC epidemiologist in China. Joe Biden\u2019s presidency achieved legislative successes like the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but suffered from inflation, housing costs, and a controversial Afghanistan withdrawal. His age and declining mental acuity, highlighted during the 2024 campaign, led to his exit, replaced by Kamala Harris, whose lack of policy differentiation and weak response to a Fox News interview sealed her defeat. The article proposes a 'dark horse' Democratic candidate\u2014unaffiliated with past failures, from the South, and avoiding identity politics\u2014to appeal to centrists and southerners. The strategy calls for avoiding past candidates, embracing stability and bipartisanship, and preparing thoroughly for media scrutiny. It assumes Trump could run again in 2028, either as a nominee or via a vice-presidential role, and concludes that while the political climate remains unfavorable, a smart, centrist, and disciplined campaign could still restore Democratic control of the White House.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 01:34 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@rwarwriter/how-the-democrats-could-take-back-the-white-house-9008c630b0c1)\n\n**Special education enforcement would be up to states under Trump plan**\nUnder the Trump administration\u2019s plan to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, federal oversight of special education enforcement would be transferred to states, raising concerns among educators, parents, and disability rights advocates. The administration fired nearly all staff in the Office for Civil Rights responsible for enforcing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), though a federal judge blocked the layoffs following a lawsuit by federal worker unions. IDEA guarantees students with disabilities a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, but federal funding covers only about 10.9% of the estimated 40% per-pupil cost promised under the law. In 2022\u20132023, approximately 7.5 million students\u201415% of public school enrollment\u2014received special education services. Without federal oversight, critics fear states may lack the resources or political will to ensure compliance, as seen in past cases like Texas, where special education services were capped at 8.5% of students regardless of need, and Virginia, which failed to resolve parent complaints due to inadequate systems. Idaho faces a $82.2 million funding gap, and its state superintendent has made special education funding a top legislative priority. States like Iowa and Alabama have introduced legislation in response, with some lawmakers questioning federal oversight and others warning of eroded civil rights protections. Critics, including special education advocate Lisa Lightner, argue that the dismantling of federal infrastructure will cause long-term damage, noting that even 'normal' levels of service have historically failed many students. Federal intervention has been critical in protecting students\u2019 rights, particularly during periods like Jim Crow, when state governments resisted integration. The Trump administration\u2019s 'Returning Education to the States' tour emphasizes state autonomy, but experts warn that removing federal accountability could leave vulnerable students without essential services. According to Quinn Perry of the Idaho School Boards Association, 'We still have a federal mandate to provide services to these kids,' underscoring that the law remains unchanged, but enforcement may not be.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Ohio Capital Journal](https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/11/05/repub/special-education-enforcement-would-be-up-to-states-under-trump-plan/)\n\n**Trump Vows to End U.S. Dependence on Chinese Rare Earths in 18 Months; Lawmakers Back Falun Gong Lawsuit Against Cisco**\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on November 2, 2025, during an interview on CBS's '60 Minutes' that the United States has launched an 'emergency action plan' to end reliance on Chinese rare earth minerals and critical minerals within 18 months. The plan, aimed at securing domestic and allied supply chains, includes new partnerships with Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Trump stated, 'We have launched an emergency action plan, and within one or one and a half years, we will have everything we need, no matter what threats we face.' U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed this, telling CNN that the rare earth crisis has prompted allies to act 'at an astonishing pace' to build alternative supply chains, with the Trump administration expected to eliminate Chinese threats within one to two years. Separately, two prominent U.S. Republican lawmakers\u2014Representative Chris Smith, Chair of the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China, and Representative John Moolenaar, Chair of the House Select Committee on China\u2014sent a letter on October 29, 2025, urging the Trump administration to support the lawsuit filed by Falun Gong practitioners against Cisco Systems. The lawsuit, initiated in 2011, alleges that Cisco helped the Chinese government develop the 'Golden Shield Project,' enabling real-time identification and surveillance of Falun Gong practitioners, leading to arrests and torture. The lawmakers emphasized that 'a U.S. technology company designing tools for the persecution of a religious minority is a serious allegation' and urged the U.S. Supreme Court to allow the case to proceed. The Supreme Court is currently reviewing Cisco\u2019s appeal to dismiss the case, and the U.S. Solicitor General, D. John Sauer, is expected to submit a written statement in early 2026.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 06:03 PM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/11/04/a104035548.html)\n\n**Trump '60 Minutes' interview: Here's what happened | FOX6 Milwaukee**\nPresident Donald Trump appeared on '60 Minutes' on November 3, 2025, marking his first interview with the program since settling a $16 million lawsuit against CBS News in the summer of 2024 over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview. The 90-minute conversation, conducted by CBS anchor Norah O\u2019Donnell at Mar-a-Lago, was edited into a 30-minute segment aired on Sunday, with an extended version and full transcript released online. Trump addressed multiple topics: he rejected Democratic demands to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, asserting he would only negotiate after a government shutdown is resolved, which had entered its sixth week\u2014making it the longest in U.S. history. He criticized the Affordable Care Act as 'terrible' and pledged to fix it if Democrats agree to reopen the government. On immigration, Trump defended recent U.S. military raids against drug-smuggling vessels off Venezuela\u2019s coast, stating they haven\u2019t gone far enough due to judicial constraints from Biden and Obama appointees. Regarding inflation, he claimed grocery prices are falling, despite September data showing a 0.3% monthly increase and a 2.7% year-over-year rise. On national security, Trump asserted the U.S. is the only country not testing nuclear weapons and said he would change that, citing Russia and China as nations that conduct underground tests. He downplayed the likelihood of war with Venezuela, though military strikes have killed at least 61 people in 14 attacks since early September without congressional authorization. On domestic policy, he affirmed his authority to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces in American cities, though he stated he has not chosen to do so. Trump praised the new ownership of CBS by Paramount under CEO David Ellison, calling it a positive development for the press, signaling improved relations with CBS News following past tensions. The interview was conducted amid a broader context of political and media dynamics, including the merger approval of Paramount and Skydance Media.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[fox6now.com](https://www.fox6now.com/news/trump-60-minutes-cbs-interview-government-shutdown-transcript)\n\n**Rep. Schrier addresses shutdown, other national issues in Wenatchee town hall - The Leavenworth Echo**\nU.S. Representative Kim Schrier (D-Wash.) held a town hall meeting at Wenatchee Valley College on October 28, 2025, to address constituents on national issues including the ongoing government shutdown since October 1, 2025, due to Congress\u2019s failure to pass 2026 fiscal year appropriations. Schrier criticized the shutdown as 'frustrating and unnecessary,' stating she had deferred her pay until the government reopened, and condemned Republican leaders and President Trump for excluding Democrats in negotiations. She emphasized that constituents elected her to advocate, not simply endorse pre-drafted plans. Schrier highlighted urgent healthcare concerns, noting that open enrollment for health insurance began on November 1 and tax credits were set to expire, expressing alarm over cuts to Medicaid, Planned Parenthood, and SNAP benefits. She stressed the need for affordable coverage to prevent a rise in the uninsured. Audience questions covered immigration, women\u2019s rights, agricultural economic pressures, democracy, and public lands, to which Schrier responded with empathy and a commitment to continued advocacy. On U.S. military aid to Israel, Schrier acknowledged the moral complexity, stating the conflict began with Hamas\u2019s attack on October 7, 2023, and calling it a defensive war. She affirmed her long-standing calls for the release of hostages and for injured children in Gaza to receive medical care in the U.S., expressing cautious hope for a lasting pause in hostilities. Schrier also denounced the Department of Energy\u2019s cancellation of $1 billion in funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, alleging it was retaliation for Washington being a 'blue state,' and warned the move undermined billions in private investment. She stated that both parties are opposing the administration on this issue. Closing the event, Schrier urged constituents to maintain community connections, avoid echo chambers, and bridge political divisions, declaring, 'Really united we stand, divided we fall.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 04:53 PM\nSource:[leavenworthecho.com](https://leavenworthecho.com/stories/rep-schrier-addresses-shutdown-other-national-issues-in-wenatchee-town-hall,147969)\n\n**How the Democrats Could Take Back the White House**\nThe article asserts that the Democrats could retake the White House in 2028, despite current political challenges. It analyzes the 2024 election outcome, in which Donald J. Trump regained the presidency amid a powerful MAGA movement, and critiques the GOP\u2019s gerrymandering, immigration enforcement, tariffs, and National Guard deployments. The piece traces the decline of American manufacturing from the 1970s onward, citing oil crises, foreign competition, trade agreements under Clinton and Obama, and offshoring, which devastated the blue-collar workforce. It argues that Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign alienated working-class voters with gender-focused messaging, contributing to Trump\u2019s rise. While Trump\u2019s first term saw low unemployment (3.5% in 2020), it was marred by pandemic mismanagement, climate denial, and institutional dismantling\u2014such as eliminating the White House pandemic response team and the CDC epidemiologist in China. Joe Biden\u2019s presidency achieved legislative successes like the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, but suffered from inflation, housing costs, and a controversial Afghanistan withdrawal. His age and declining mental acuity, highlighted during the 2024 campaign, led to his exit, replaced by Kamala Harris, whose lack of policy differentiation and weak response to a Fox News interview sealed her defeat. The article proposes a 'dark horse' Democratic candidate\u2014unaffiliated with past failures, from the South, and avoiding identity politics\u2014to appeal to centrists and southerners. The strategy calls for avoiding past candidates, embracing stability and bipartisanship, and preparing thoroughly for media scrutiny. It assumes Trump could run again in 2028, either as a nominee or via a vice-presidential role, and concludes that while the political climate remains unfavorable, a smart, centrist, and disciplined campaign could still restore Democratic control of the White House.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 01:34 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@rwarwriter/how-the-democrats-could-take-back-the-white-house-9008c630b0c1)\n\n**Special education enforcement would be up to states under Trump plan**\nUnder the Trump administration\u2019s plan to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, federal oversight of special education enforcement would be transferred to states, raising concerns among educators, parents, and disability rights advocates. The administration fired nearly all staff in the Office for Civil Rights responsible for enforcing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), though a federal judge blocked the layoffs following a lawsuit by federal worker unions. IDEA guarantees students with disabilities a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, but federal funding covers only about 10.9% of the estimated 40% per-pupil cost promised under the law. In 2022\u20132023, approximately 7.5 million students\u201415% of public school enrollment\u2014received special education services. Without federal oversight, critics fear states may lack the resources or political will to ensure compliance, as seen in past cases like Texas, where special education services were capped at 8.5% of students regardless of need, and Virginia, which failed to resolve parent complaints due to inadequate systems. Idaho faces a $82.2 million funding gap, and its state superintendent has made special education funding a top legislative priority. States like Iowa and Alabama have introduced legislation in response, with some lawmakers questioning federal oversight and others warning of eroded civil rights protections. Critics, including special education advocate Lisa Lightner, argue that the dismantling of federal infrastructure will cause long-term damage, noting that even 'normal' levels of service have historically failed many students. Federal intervention has been critical in protecting students\u2019 rights, particularly during periods like Jim Crow, when state governments resisted integration. The Trump administration\u2019s 'Returning Education to the States' tour emphasizes state autonomy, but experts warn that removing federal accountability could leave vulnerable students without essential services. According to Quinn Perry of the Idaho School Boards Association, 'We still have a federal mandate to provide services to these kids,' underscoring that the law remains unchanged, but enforcement may not be.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[Ohio Capital Journal](https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/11/05/repub/special-education-enforcement-would-be-up-to-states-under-trump-plan/)\n\n**Trump Vows to End U.S. Dependence on Chinese Rare Earths in 18 Months; Lawmakers Back Falun Gong Lawsuit Against Cisco**\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on November 2, 2025, during an interview on CBS's '60 Minutes' that the United States has launched an 'emergency action plan' to end reliance on Chinese rare earth minerals and critical minerals within 18 months. The plan, aimed at securing domestic and allied supply chains, includes new partnerships with Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Trump stated, 'We have launched an emergency action plan, and within one or one and a half years, we will have everything we need, no matter what threats we face.'

Trump claimed the delay is due to Democrats\u2019 refusal to pass a continuing resolution, asserting that SNAP benefits were excessively expanded under former President Joe Biden due to 'haphazard' distribution to anyone who asked, rather than only those in need. A federal judge had ordered the administration to use emergency funds to partially support SNAP, with a $4.65 billion payment made, but the process could take 'a few weeks to up to several months.' The government has been shut down since October 1, 2024, and Democrats have rejected 13 continuing resolution proposals, demanding healthcare subsidies in exchange. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) confirmed there are no funds for SNAP due to the shutdown. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins accused Democrats of obstructing efforts to prevent fraud, claiming that 21 blue states refused to provide SNAP data and two even sued the USDA. Rollins asserted that in the 29 cooperating states, 'massive fraud' was already uncovered, alleging that Democrats are protecting illegal immigrants to preserve political power, warning that if benefits stop, 'those illegals will go back home' and Democrats would lose over 20 seats after the next census. Rollins added that 'a new sheriff is in town' under Trump, who will not tolerate 'waste, fraud, or abuse' while Americans go hungry. Currently, 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, with federal spending reaching nearly $100 billion in 2024 and an average monthly benefit of $187.20 per recipient.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 01:45 PM\nSource:[The Daily Wire](https://www.dailywire.com/news/trump-says-no-snap-this-is-all-on-democrats-and-we-wont-budge)\n\n**Trump '60 Minutes' interview: Here's what happened | FOX6 Milwaukee**\nPresident Donald Trump appeared on '60 Minutes' on November 3, 2025, marking his first interview with the program since settling a $16 million lawsuit against CBS News in the summer of 2024 over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview.

Key races include gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia, a high-stakes ballot measure in California (Proposition 50), state Supreme Court retention elections in Pennsylvania, and mayoral races in major cities like New York City. Proposition 50, backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, seeks to bypass California\u2019s independent redistricting commission to draw more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in response to Trump\u2019s push for GOP-friendly redistricting in red states. This move could counterbalance Republican gains in other states and influence control of the U.S. House. The results will be closely watched as a precursor to the 2026 midterms, when control of Congress will be decided. Seven major questions are emerging: Which party has momentum? Can California\u2019s redistricting effort check Trump\u2019s agenda? Will Proposition 50 boost Newsom\u2019s 2028 presidential ambitions? Does anti-Trump messaging still resonate with swing voters? Are Trump\u2019s policies backfiring, especially in states like Virginia and New Jersey affected by government shutdowns and federal funding cuts? How will Democratic internal divisions\u2014between moderates and progressives\u2014play out in races like New York City\u2019s mayoral contest, where socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani leads? And which other races, such as mayoral elections in Detroit, Minneapolis, and Pittsburgh, or Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court retention vote, could have national implications, particularly on issues like federal troop deployment and election litigation? The outcomes will inform both party strategies heading into the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential primary.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 10:01 AM\nSource:[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/02/election-day-2025-trump-nj-ny-california-virginia/86567882007/)\n\n**Judge orders Trump administration to restore school mental health grants**\nA federal judge, Kymberly K. Evanson of the Western District of Washington, ordered the Trump administration to restore over $1 billion in congressionally approved grants for school-based mental health services, reversing cuts made in April 2025. The grants, established in response to the 2022 Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 students and two teachers, were intended to expand access to counseling and reduce financial barriers to becoming school psychologists. The Education Department had halted funding, citing President Donald Trump\u2019s January 2025 executive order opposing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, and replaced the grants with a new competition emphasizing 'non-ideological' criteria. However, Judge Evanson ruled the cuts unconstitutional, stating Congress had repeatedly reaffirmed the need for school mental health services and that the funding cuts caused layoffs, reduced graduate student retention, and removed critical resources from rural and underserved communities. The decision affects 16 states\u2014California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin\u2014that sued the Department, arguing the cuts disrupted services for nearly 775,000 students. In New York, $7.6 million in funds will be restored. The National Association of School Psychologists called the grants essential in addressing nationwide shortages of mental health professionals. The Education Department defended the cuts, claiming some recipients used funds for race-based recruitment, but Judge Evanson ordered the government to submit a compliance report within 48 hours. The agency has vowed to appeal the injunction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 12:32 PM\nSource:[phillytrib.com](https://www.phillytrib.com/news/health/judge-orders-trump-administration-to-restore-school-mental-health-grants/article_2cb07637-1ba8-44a5-9325-d3aee4e20a4d.html)\n\n**Education layoffs likely mean more students slipping through cracks**\nThe U.S. Department of Education is undergoing significant staff reductions, with 466 employees laid off on Friday as part of a planned reduction of over 4,200 positions, representing nearly 20% of its workforce. This marks the second major round of cuts during President Donald Trump's tenure, resulting in the department losing more than half of its staff. The reductions, linked to the ongoing federal shutdown and political pressure on Democratic legislators, threaten critical functions including special education services, civil rights enforcement, after-school programming, and the administration of federal funding such as Title I and Pell Grants. States dependent on federal education funding will be particularly affected. The Department of Education does not operate local schools but coordinates federal policy, enforces civil rights, and ensures compliance with federal mandates. Its discretionary budget is approximately $80 billion annually, supplemented by large mandatory spending for student aid. Despite the federal role being supplemental\u2014supplying about 10% of K-12 funding\u2014its oversight is pivotal in protecting underserved students and maintaining national standards. The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Project 2025 proposes abolishing or drastically shrinking the department, a plan echoed in the Trump administration\u2019s 2018 'Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century' reorganization proposal. Experts warn that these cuts will exacerbate achievement gaps, delay funding distribution, and increase student and parent disputes, especially in special education. According to the National Education Association, the department has already begun withholding school funding for fiscal year 2025, and the Government Accountability Office has highlighted systemic risks from the staffing crisis. The article notes that at-risk students will be disproportionately impacted, as federally coordinated programs face administrative slowdowns and reduced capacity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[Las Vegas Sun](https://lasvegassun.com/news/2025/oct/14/education-layoffs-likely-mean-more-students-slippi/)\n\n**Trump campaigned on closing the Education Department. Reality is more difficult.**\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March\u202f20\u202f2025 to shrink the Department of Education, a move that would require congressional approval to fully dissolve the agency. Trump\u2019s plan includes mass layoffs and the transfer of certain services to other agencies, and a Supreme Court ruling in July temporarily cleared the way for the administration to proceed with these cuts.  However, GOP\u2011controlled Congress has stalled the agency\u2019s abolition.  In the Senate, Republicans hold 53 seats, short of the 60\u2011vote threshold needed to advance most legislation, and the House Committee on Education and Workforce has not yet voted on any of the four bills introduced by Representatives Thomas Massie, David Rouzer, Barry Moore and Nathaniel Moran.  Senate leaders, including Sen. Mike Rounds, Sen. Jim Banks and Sen. Tim Sheehy, reintroduced a companion bill in April, while Sen. Rand Paul reintroduced a similar measure in March with Sen. Mike Lee and Sen. Bernie Moreno.  Appropriations have also posed a hurdle: the Senate Appropriations Committee advanced a bipartisan bill in July that allocates $79\u202fbillion in discretionary funding for fiscal\u202f2026\u2014roughly the current level\u2014and rejects Trump\u2019s $12\u202fbillion cut proposal.  The House Appropriations subcommittee, however, advanced a spending proposal on September\u202f2 that calls for $67\u202fbillion, aligns more closely with Trump\u2019s cut priorities, and cuts Title\u202fI grant funding by $5.2\u202fbillion, while both chambers keep the Pell Grant maximum at $7,395.  The Department of Education\u2019s 45\u2011year history and the need for congressional approval make its closure a complex, ongoing political battle.  \"Our intentions are to ultimately dissolve the Department of Education \u2014 we know we have to do that in a way that makes sense and so, we\u2019ll take a look at all bills,\" said House Committee Chair Tim Walberg.  \"I can\u2019t say whether they will all come up or not, but we know that, working with the secretary of Education, we\u2019re going to right\u2011size it, and some things we\u2019ll eliminate, other things we\u2019ll shift, as we\u2019ve done already, over to the Department of Labor to take on some workforce areas,\" Walberg added.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[Kansas Reflector](https://kansasreflector.com/2025/09/07/repub/trump-campaigned-on-closing-the-education-department-reality-is-more-difficult/)\n\n**Donald Trump Wants to Eliminate that Department of Education; Can He Do It?**\nDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Donald Trump, now President-elect, pledged to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, stating in his book 'Great Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America' that 'a lot of people believe the Department of Education should just be eliminated. Get rid of it. If we don\u2019t eliminate it completely, we certainly need to cut its power and reach.' Trump argued that the rising cost of college and the burden of student debt reflect systemic failures, which he attributes to federal overreach in education. According to Harvard legal scholar Laurence Tribe, while there is no constitutional barrier preventing Congress from abolishing the Department of Education, such an action would require a new act of Congress\u2014meaning Trump cannot unilaterally eliminate it. However, Trump\u2019s 100-day plan indicates an intention to shift educational oversight to local communities, suggesting a significant reorganization of federal education authority rather than outright abolition. The article notes that Trump\u2019s claim, though initially seen as extreme, has gained credibility due to his impending presidency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2016 05:17 PM\nSource:[thelincolnianonline.com](https://www.thelincolnianonline.com/2016/11/13/donald-trump-wants-to-eliminate-that-department-of-education-can-he-do-it.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts from varied disciplines\u2014including US federal policy, political science, public administration, and legal studies\u2014assign an extremely low probability (2-3%) to the Department of Education being legally abolished or reorganized (eliminated/renamed) by law or presidential reorganization authority before January 1, 2026. Their reasoning is cohesive: \n\n- **Congressional Barriers**: The Republican-controlled Senate, with 53 seats, lacks the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster on such a contentious issue; there is strong and unified Democratic opposition, and even some GOP moderates show reluctance. No relevant bills have advanced to a floor vote in either chamber, and committee leadership has not prioritized abolition.\n- **Legislative and Procedural Inertia**: No cabinet-level department has been eliminated by law since the mid-20th century, reflecting entrenched institutional inertia and path dependence. The base rate for such abolition is effectively zero. Even laws or authority delegations to enable this would themselves face severe procedural challenges.\n- **Executive Action Constraints**: While Trump has overseen mass layoffs and attempted aggressive downsizing of the Department, executive orders and administrative changes do not meet the strict legal threshold set out in the question. Actual abolition requires Congressional action or reorganization authority, which has not occurred and is not imminent.\n- **Interest Group and Legal Resistance**: Public sector unions, state governments, advocacy groups (especially for special education and civil rights), and the judiciary have actively opposed major administrative actions, leading to litigation and reversals of key cuts or program freezes.\n- **Political Context**: The persistent government shutdown, legislative gridlock, budget standoffs, and impending election cycle further crowd out the time and bandwidth for controversial structural reforms.\n- **Scenarios**: All experts describe a 'No' outcome as overwhelmingly likely\u2014continued rhetoric, ongoing layoffs, program cuts, but no law or reorganization order actually abolishing or renaming the agency. The 'Yes' scenario is described as a speculative, extraordinary breakthrough, such as attaching abolition to a must-pass bill or a sudden alignment of Senate votes, which is judged highly improbable.\n\nIn sum, despite aggressive intentions, strong symbolic Executive action, and public advocacy for abolition, the built-in legal, procedural, and political barriers make the formal elimination of the Department of Education by the end of 2025 an extreme long shot according to expert consensus.",
