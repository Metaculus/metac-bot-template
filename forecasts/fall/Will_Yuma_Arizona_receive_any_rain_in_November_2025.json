The news contains no mention of incoming large-scale storms or high-confidence synoptic setups favoring rain in the first half of November 2025. Most tropical remnant activity dissipates before mid-October in this region, and November storm tracks usually stay north.

There were minor critiques that even numbers in the high 30s veer slightly optimistic given the modal 0.00\" November. Defense of my forecast highlighted its balanced, data-centric foundation.

Critique of more elevated probabilities (i.e., 38% or above, and especially the extreme at 48%) is compelling: these rely on recency bias and overstate the predictive power of anomalous antecedent moisture or rare autumn synoptic events. The base rate must dominate, with only slight upward adjustment if any. My initial probability of 35% is at the upper edge of justifiable, already reflecting that slightly thickened wet-event tail.

Given this, my initial probability of 38%\u2014while defensible and on the upper end of the sensible range\u2014is best revised downward modestly to honor the weight of historical data and group consensus, placing greater emphasis on the modal outcome (no rain) and less on uncommon wet tails.",

Intense rainfall is anticipated, with a projected 1150 mm of precipitation\u2014about 85% of the historical average\u2014spread over five days, including episodes of short-duration heavy rain that could cause localized flooding. The rainy season may start as late as the second half of December. Temperatures are expected to be slightly above average, with highs reaching up to 36\u202f\u00b0C, particularly on the west coast, accompanied by high humidity and light winds, creating uncomfortable conditions. Cyclone activity is also forecasted, with over ten moderate tropical storms expected, forming primarily east of Diego Garcia.

The October 2025 weather, marked by heat, storms, and near-freezing temperatures (2\u20136\u202f\u00b0C, with a low of 2.5\u202f\u00b0C in Chacabuco), did not harm the wheat, which was in the advanced pasty stage\u2014reducing frost risk. Rainfall averaged 105\u202fmm across 36 GEA stations, the fourth consecutive month above normal, with Pergamino recording 160\u202fmm, crucial for grain filling. Wheat yields are projected to exceed 40 quintals per hectare in most areas, with some zones like Corral de Bustos seeing yields of 40\u201370\u202fqq/ha, and Marcos Ju\u00e1rez anticipating 45\u201350\u202fqq/ha. The key determinant of success will be fertilization: well-nourished crops are expected to break records, while under-fertilized ones will be limited. Maize, though affected by cold, remains resilient due to prior good leaf development and moisture, with recovery expected as temperatures rise. However, soya planting remains behind schedule, with only 10% of 3.2 million hectares sown, due to saturated soils and persistent rain in Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. In Ca\u00f1ada de G\u00f3mez, some fields show damping off and planchado due to excess moisture. The forecast for early November includes intermittent rains and temperature swings (up to 32\u202f\u00b0C, then a cold front), but the overall climate pattern\u2014moderate temperatures, adequate moisture, and no severe frost\u2014has made October a pivotal month. The region has transitioned from extreme drought in 2023 to abundant water and exceptional yield potential in 2025. Agronomists across the region, including in Aldao, Pergamino, and Carlos Pellegrini, echo the sentiment: 'Zafamos'\u2014'We got through it'\u2014now less as relief and more as celebration.

Mitigation measures include debris flow barriers and community education. A La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon is expected during the monsoon period, with Sabah likely to experience the strongest impacts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 10:41 PM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2025/11/03/over-200-roads-flagged-as-unsafe)\n\n**Wheat Avoids Frost and Secures 'Historic Campaign' in Argentina's Core Region**\nThe wheat crop in Argentina's core region avoided frost damage despite fears, leading to a campaign described as 'historical' by agronomists. The October 2025 weather, marked by heat, storms, and near-freezing temperatures (2\u20136\u202f\u00b0C, with a low of 2.5\u202f\u00b0C in Chacabuco), did not harm the wheat, which was in the advanced pasty stage\u2014reducing frost risk. Rainfall averaged 105\u202fmm across 36 GEA stations, the fourth consecutive month above normal, with Pergamino recording 160\u202fmm, crucial for grain filling. Wheat yields are projected to exceed 40 quintals per hectare in most areas, with some zones like Corral de Bustos seeing yields of 40\u201370\u202fqq/ha, and Marcos Ju\u00e1rez anticipating 45\u201350\u202fqq/ha. The key determinant of success will be fertilization: well-nourished crops are expected to break records, while under-fertilized ones will be limited. Maize, though affected by cold, remains resilient due to prior good leaf development and moisture, with recovery expected as temperatures rise. However, soya planting remains behind schedule, with only 10% of 3.2 million hectares sown, due to saturated soils and persistent rain in Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. In Ca\u00f1ada de G\u00f3mez, some fields show damping off and planchado due to excess moisture. The forecast for early November includes intermittent rains and temperature swings (up to 32\u202f\u00b0C, then a cold front), but the overall climate pattern\u2014moderate temperatures, adequate moisture, and no severe frost\u2014has made October a pivotal month. The region has transitioned from extreme drought in 2023 to abundant water and exceptional yield potential in 2025. Agronomists across the region, including in Aldao, Pergamino, and Carlos Pellegrini, echo the sentiment: 'Zafamos'\u2014'We got through it'\u2014now less as relief and more as celebration. The wheat has not only survived frost but emerged as the central figure of a campaign poised to enter history.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 02:25 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/campo/2025/11/02/el-trigo-esquivo-el-frio-y-consolida-una-campana-historica-en-la-region-nucleo/)\n\n**November Begins with Below-Average Autumn Sunshine and High Rainfall Risk, Typhoon Season May Persist**\nAccording to the latest one-month forecast, November 2025 is expected to see rainfall levels near or above average nationwide, particularly in western and northern Pacific-side regions of Japan. The forecast indicates a high likelihood of heavy rains continuing into November, with numerical weather models suggesting an increased chance of low-pressure systems forming over the South China Sea, implying the typhoon season may not have ended. On November 1 (Saturday), a rapidly developing low-pressure system and frontal zone caused record-breaking rainfall across northern Japan. In Futaba District, Fukushima Prefecture, a peak rainfall of 86.5 mm per hour was recorded, setting a new historical record since 1976. In Hiraizumi District, Iwate Prefecture, 146.0 mm of rain fell in six hours, the highest November rainfall on record. Over 100 locations recorded their highest November 6-hour rainfall totals. The forecast for November 1\u201330 indicates above-average rainfall nationwide, with fewer sunny autumn days than usual. The increased rainfall is attributed to a higher likelihood of influence from low-pressure systems and fronts. Numerical models predict lower sea-level pressure over the South China Sea, indicating a higher chance of low-pressure development. As of noon on November 1, a tropical depression was active near the Caroline Islands, expected to strengthen into Typhoon 25 within 24 hours. Currently, it is projected to move westward with low risk of approaching Japan, but sea surface temperatures remain above average, raising concerns that the typhoon season may continue into November. Meteorologist Yu Suzuki warns continued vigilance is necessary.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 06:56 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/0ea9b5d48fc4d6431938c2ae52fc48c9bf9e2199)\n\n**Yuma locals prepare for upcoming rain**\nResidents of Yuma, Arizona, are preparing for incoming rainfall expected this week, triggered by the remnants of Tropical Storm Priscilla.

    "summary": "Experts broadly agree that November is typically an extremely dry month in Yuma, Arizona, with measurable precipitation occurring in only about 20\u201345% of years. The predominant historical pattern is for no rain at all. All forecasts use the base climatological rate as a key starting point, noting that November is either the driest or one of the driest months for Yuma, with a median precipitation close to 0.00 inches and only a handful of Novembers in recent decades seeing measurable rainfall. \n\nRecent developments, such as a wetter-than-average monsoon and late summer/fall in 2025 and improved drought conditions, are acknowledged as possibly nudging the probability of rain slightly higher than the strict historical average. Some experts mention the potential (but rarity) of precipitation from Pacific cutoff lows, residual tropical systems, or atmospheric river events, although these are far more likely to occur before November and become much less frequent as autumn proceeds. All forecasters note that no such events are apparent in the immediate medium-range or seasonal news and forecast outlooks as of early November 2025. No strong El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a signals or seasonal model trends towards wetter-than-normal conditions for the month are currently identified.\n\nThe plausible 'No' scenario is that the current dry pattern continues under persistent high pressure, with weak cold fronts or disturbances passing through without producing measurable precipitation, and all days registering 0.00 inches. The 'Yes' scenario would involve a rare storm system, likely a cutoff low, or the remnants of a tropical storm bringing at least 0.01 inches on one day\u2014though this is considered unlikely.\n\nExpert probabilities for measurable rain in November 2025 at Yuma International Airport mostly cluster in the 30\u201338% range, with a single outlier up to 48%. Most lean slightly toward a 'No' outcome, but none assign overwhelming certainty against rain, leaving meaningful space for a rare November event. The group consensus is that, while slightly elevated regional moisture and recent anomalous rains are taken into consideration, the base rate of dry Novembers remains the dominant factor. The modal forecast is therefore a modest probability (30\u201338%) of any measurable precipitation, with dryness expecting to prevail but not guaranteed.",
