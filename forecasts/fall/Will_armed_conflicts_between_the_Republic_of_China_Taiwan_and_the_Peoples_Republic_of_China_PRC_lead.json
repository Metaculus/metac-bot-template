The recent US arms sale reinforces deterrence. Both major civilian and military actors have publicly signaled their desire to avoid war, and public opinion in Taiwan is anti-escalation. While a crisis involving Japan or the US could be an unpredictable trigger, there is no evidence of ongoing operational-level preparations by the PLA for a full-scale or even limited kinetic action. Given the dramatic consequences, the compressed timeline, and the weight of recent historical precedent, a kinetic military event causing 100+ deaths in the cross-strait context before January 1, 2026, is extremely unlikely.",

The base rate for direct, mass-casualty armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait is extremely low, and the tight time window (<2 months) offers little opportunity for either side to upend years of careful crisis management. While risk is real at the margins, and miscalculation is not impossible, the absence of any precedent incidents trending toward the resolution threshold weighs heavily against the scenario. The greatest current military risks center on the South China Sea standoffs (notably with the Philippines), not direct lethal exchanges with Taiwan.

All PLA provocations remain below the kinetic threshold that would risk 100+ deaths\u2014a fact reinforced by new, unofficial Xi-Trump pledges and by all actors\u2019 risk aversion to a premature, potentially catastrophic war ahead of 2027, when PLA readiness is more widely anticipated. Increased US arms sales serve to bolster deterrence and resilience, but also incentivize Beijing to calibrate its response below the threshold of overt war. Although there is a non-negligible risk of accidental escalation (black swan), historical and structural deterrents, crisis protocols, risk aversion on all sides, and the lack of new, substantive provocations or military accidents in recent months all suggest the probability of this crossing the 100-death threshold before January 2026 remains low.

There is always tail risk of a bolt-from-the-blue event, especially with more actors in the theatre, but historically, such accidents have not resulted in mass casualties. My assessment, incorporating both base rates (since 1949, no direct ROC-PRC battle over the main island; gray-zone skirmishing never crossed the threshold despite repeated crises) and the evidence of active crisis management mechanisms, is that the odds of >100 deaths due to direct armed conflict before January 1, 2026, are quite low, and if nothing significant changes in the next 45 days, the likelihood further recedes.",

Realist logic demands harder lines\u2014not hand-waving at 'nonzero' risk. There is a difference between true model residual risk and a subjective sense that 'it could happen.' If the empirical indicators point firmly away from war (as all evidence does), even on the razor\u2019s edge of crisis, your probability should be in the 1-3% bracket that conveys this. Anything higher is paradoxically less realist: it overstates the frequency and significance of the rarest, least favored outcome, undercutting your own argument for order, restraint, and rational state action.

Notably, the overwhelming weight of base rate arguments, absence of operational or intelligence indicators, and the robust pattern of gray-zone-only provocations consistently reinforce my original assessment. The primary critique leveled at my forecast was that even 5% may be somewhat high, with multiple forecasters advocating for probabilities in the 1\u20133% range as a more precise reflection of true risk, given the lack of precedent and current indicators. Their arguments regarding inflated tail risk and the need for modeling discipline suggest that I should further sharpen my estimate.

Critiques of higher single-digit probabilities (5-6%) rightly point out that such estimates overweight 'tail risk' when the empirical and structural constraints are so robust.

As realism demands the sharpest clarity about capabilities and revealed intent, the absence of any kinetic incidents, lack of force mobilization, and severe time constraint (less than two months) strongly suggest that a probability at or below 2% best reflects the model.

Under the pseudonym Zhong Sheng, the newspaper labeled Takaichi's remarks as evidence of Japan's 'ambitions to revive military expansion' and described them as 'extremely perverse intentions' revealing the 'obsession and arrogance' of Japan's right-wing forces to break constitutional pacifist constraints and pursue great-power military status. The article accused Tokyo of 'recklessly accelerating its rearmament path' and attempting to use a 'potential contingency in Taiwan' as a pretext for military expansion. It drew historical parallels, questioning whether Japan intends to repeat past mistakes by invoking 'existential crises' to justify invasions. The article warned that any Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan Strait would be considered an 'aggression' by China, prompting a 'direct strike' in response, and urged Tokyo to 'immediately correct its provocative conduct' and 'retract harmful statements' or face 'all consequences.' The statement followed a formal protest by China's Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, who summoned Japanese ambassador Kenji Kanasugi. Takaichi stated in parliament that a crisis in Taiwan could place Japan in a 'crisis situation,' justifying intervention by the Japan Self-Defense Forces under collective self-defense principles. Taiwan, which has self-governance since 1949, is claimed by China as an 'independent province' and integral territory, with Beijing having repeatedly threatened military force to achieve reunification. Although Japan recognized the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate government in 1972, it maintains unofficial relations with Taipei, and former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (1954\u20132022) publicly supported military response to any invasion of Taiwan under the U.S.-Japan security treaty. Tensions escalated further after the Chinese consul in Osaka, Xue Jian, posted and later deleted a social media message calling for 'cutting off Takaichi's head,' prompting a formal diplomatic complaint from Japan.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 06:48 AM\nSource:[SAPO](https://sapo.pt/artigo/taiwan-pequim-acusa-toquio-de-ressuscitar-militarismo-japones-6916d07552458d50e6b96d90)\n\n**People's Daily: Gao Shi Zaomiao's Taiwan Remarks Are Extremely Sinister, Offensive, and Dangerous**\nOn November 14, 2025, the People's Daily published a commentary titled 'We Will Not Tolerate Gao Shi Zaomiao's Provocative Actions on the Taiwan Issue.' The article strongly condemned Japanese Prime Minister Gao Shi Zaomiao for asserting in the Diet that 'Taiwan's crisis' could constitute a 'national survival crisis' justifying Japan's collective self-defense rights, implying potential military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. The People's Daily labeled her remarks as 'extremely sinister in intent, extremely\u6076\u52a3 in nature, and extremely serious in consequences.' The commentary emphasized that this marks the first time since Japan's 1945 defeat that a Japanese leader has formally linked Taiwan's crisis to collective self-defense, signaling a clear ambition for armed intervention and a direct threat to China. It recalled Japan's colonial rule of Taiwan from 1895 to 1945 under the Treaty of Shimonoseki, including brutal suppression and resource plunder, and affirmed that the 1945 victory of the Chinese people in the War of Resistance against Japan led to Japan's formal surrender and the return of Taiwan to Chinese sovereignty under international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. The article stressed that as a defeated power, Japan must reflect on its historical responsibilities and uphold its commitments to the one-China principle. Gao's linkage of Taiwan to Japan's security undermines the 2008 China-Japan political document stating mutual non-threat and breaches the core of the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement. The commentary warned that her remarks reflect Japan's right-wing forces' ambition to break the pacifist constitution, pursue military power, and abandon the 'three non-nuclear principles.' It condemned her actions as part of a pattern of revising history, including visits to Yasukuni Shrine, denial of the Nanjing Massacre, and amplifying the 'China threat' narrative. The article warned that Japan's invocation of 'survival crisis' echoes its past imperial justifications for aggression, such as the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, and warned against repeating history. It reaffirmed that national reunification is an unstoppable historical trend, and that any attempt to interfere in Taiwan will be met with resolute resistance. The People's Daily concluded with a warning: any military intervention by Japan would constitute aggression, and China will respond forcefully; Japan must immediately retract its remarks and cease dangerous military moves, or bear full responsibility for the consequences.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 02:04 AM\nSource:[QQ\u65b0\u95fb\u4e2d\u5fc3](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20251114A00VLQ00)\n\n**Tensions Rise in Asia: China's Firm Response to Japan's Taiwan Remarks**\nChina has issued a firm response to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takai\u00e7i's remarks suggesting Japan might use military force in the event of a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian stated that any such intervention by Japan would be considered an 'aggressive act' and that China would respond with force. Lin emphasized China's commitment to exercising its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law, reaffirming the protection of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. He urged Japan to immediately retract its statements, warning it would have to bear the consequences if it did not. Lin also questioned whether Takai\u00e7i\u2019s invocation of a 'national existence crisis' scenario signaled a return to Japan\u2019s past military aggression, accusing Japan of attempting to undermine the post-war international order. Takai\u00e7i had previously described a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait as a threat to Japan\u2019s existence under Japan\u2019s 2015 National Security Law, which permits the use of armed forces in response to attacks on allies that threaten Japan\u2019s survival. While Japan\u2019s leadership has previously protested China\u2019s objections, Takai\u00e7i maintained that his remarks were hypothetical and that he would avoid such statements in the future, but refused to retract them. The article also provides historical context: Taiwan was under Japanese control from 1895 to 1945 following the First Sino-Japanese War, after which it was handed over to the Allied Powers. Following the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party established the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, while the defeated Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, claiming to continue the Republic of China. Since 1949, Taiwan has functioned as a de facto independent entity. China continues to assert the 'One China' principle, opposes Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic recognition by other nations, and demands that countries sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. In recent years, China has increased military pressure on Taiwan, explicitly stating it would not rule out the use of force to achieve reunification.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:58 PM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/asyada-gerilim-artiyor-cinden-japonyaya-sert-yanit-979866h.htm)\n\n**China Warns Japan: Military Intervention in Taiwan Strait Would Trigger Forceful Response**\nOn November 13, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian condemned Japanese Prime Minister Asahi Hayato's remarks during a parliamentary session on November 7, in which she stated that a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait could constitute a 'national survival crisis' for Japan. Lin Jian emphasized that such statements violate the one-China principle, breach the spirit of the four joint political documents between China and Japan, and contravene basic norms of international relations. He warned that if Japan resorts to military intervention in the Taiwan Strait, China will 'strike back forcefully' and exercise its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Lin Jian underscored that Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and resolving the Taiwan issue is an internal matter for China, not subject to external interference. He questioned Japan's motives, drawing historical parallels to Japan's militarist past, including the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, and warned that repeating such rhetoric risks undermining post-war international order and damaging Sino-Japanese relations. Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao also denounced the claim on X, stating that promoting 'Taiwan's crisis is Japan's crisis' seeks to drag Japan into a path of splitting China, which would lead to an irreversible and dangerous course. The Japanese 'survival crisis' doctrine, as defined by the 2015 revised security laws, allows Japan to exercise collective self-defense and take military action without prior U.S. approval if a foreign country under close ties is attacked and the threat is deemed to endanger Japan's survival, effectively including Taiwan in that category.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 09:14 AM\nSource:[guancha.cn](https://www.guancha.cn/internation/2025_11_13_796879.shtml)\n\n**China Condemns Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi's Remarks on Taiwan, Warns of Self-Defense Response to Military Intervention**\nChina's Foreign Ministry strongly criticized Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi for her remarks in the Diet on November 10, 2024, in which she stated that 'Taiwan's crisis could constitute a national survival crisis for Japan,' allowing Japan to exercise collective self-defense. According to the Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian, Takaichi made these provocative statements about Taiwan's security despite China's formal protests and continued to refuse to retract them. China reiterated that any Japanese military intervention in the Taiwan Strait would be considered an act of aggression, and China would respond with decisive force, firmly exercising its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law. Lin Jian emphasized Japan\u2019s historical responsibility, recalling its colonial rule over Taiwan and its past use of 'national survival crisis' as a pretext for aggression, including the Mukden Incident and the invasion of China, which caused immense suffering. He questioned whether Takaichi\u2019s current rhetoric signals a revival of Japanese militarism and a challenge to the post-World War II international order. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also reaffirmed that Taiwan is a sovereign state, with its sovereignty belonging to all Taiwanese people, and that the People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan\u2014this is a widely recognized international fact. China warned Japan against interfering in its internal affairs, calling such actions a manifestation of hegemonic behavior and a threat to global stability. The statement concluded with a warning: 'Those who play with fire will be burned.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 08:58 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/acn/202511130285.aspx)\n\n**First U.S. Military Sale to Taiwan Under Trump's Second Term**\nThe United States approved a $330 million military sale to Taiwan, marking the first such transaction since President Donald Trump took office in January 2025. The package includes non-standard components, spare parts, repair supplies, and support for F-16, C-130, and Indigenous Defense Fighter (IDF) aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense stated the sale will enhance Taiwan's ability to address current and future threats by maintaining the operational readiness of its air fleet. The Pentagon emphasized that the delivery will strengthen Taiwan's air defenses, improve resilience, and bolster its capacity to respond to Chinese incursions in the 'gray zone.' Taiwan's Ministry of Defense confirmed the sale is expected to take effect within one month. Taiwan's presidential office, through spokesperson Karen Kuo, called the deepening U.S.-Taiwan security alliance a 'fundamental pillar for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.' China strongly condemned the sale, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian stating that Taiwan is a core interest for China and a 'red line' in U.S.-China relations. China regularly conducts military missions near Taiwan, which Taipei labels 'gray zone' activities\u2014pressuring but not escalating to direct combat. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out the use of force; Taiwan rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims and asserts that only its people can decide its future. Trump claimed that Xi Jinping assured him Taiwan would not be invaded during his presidency. The sale follows a high-stakes meeting between Trump and Xi in South Korea aimed at securing a trade deal. Prior to the meeting, concerns in Taipei had risen that Trump might sacrifice Taiwan's interests for a China deal. Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te has pledged to increase defense spending amid sustained Chinese military pressure. Although the U.S. does not formally recognize Taiwan as a state, it remains its largest arms supplier and is legally obligated to provide defensive capabilities under the Taiwan Relations Act. Taiwan has a domestic defense industry but remains heavily reliant on U.S. arms, as its military would be decisively outmatched in a conflict with China.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 08:52 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/es/ee-uu-aprueba-primera-venta-militar-a-taiw%C3%A1n-del-segundo-gobierno-de-trump/a-74740145)\n\n**China Accuses Tokyo of Resurrecting 'Japanese Militarism' Over Taiwan Intervention Remarks**\nThe official Communist Party of China newspaper, People's Daily, warned of a 'dangerous resurgence of Japanese militarism' following statements by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi about potential Japanese intervention in a conflict across the Taiwan Strait.

According to a Pentagon statement, the proposed sale would enhance Taiwan's ability to address current and future threats by maintaining the operational readiness of its fleet of F-16 and C-130 aircraft and others. China claims Taiwan, a self-governing democracy, as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to regain control.

President Donald Trump stated that Chinese President Xi Jinping informed him that China would not invade Taiwan during Trump's presidency. The announcement follows a meeting between Trump and Xi in late October in South Korea, aimed at reaching a trade agreement. The U.S. maintains formal diplomatic relations with China while preserving unofficial ties with Taiwan, which remains its primary arms supplier.

On November 13, 2025, Lin Jian issued four sharp questions, warning that any Japanese military involvement would constitute an 'aggression' and would be met with a 'thunderous counterattack.' This characterization of Japan's actions as 'aggression' is highly unusual and evokes historical references to Japan's 1931\u20131945 invasion of China, including the 1894 Sino-Japanese War. The tone shifted from the November 10 'three questions'\u2014focused on asserting China\u2019s sovereignty and condemning Japan\u2019s interference\u2014to a direct warning: 'those who play with fire will burn themselves.' On November 13, Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong formally summoned Japanese Ambassador Kimbashi Kenji to deliver a stern protest. On November 14, the People's Daily published a scathing editorial titled 'We Will Not Tolerate Sanae Takaichi\u2019s Dangerous Provocations on Taiwan,' labeling her remarks as the first time a Japanese leader has explicitly linked Taiwan's crisis to collective self-defense rights, thus revealing Japan\u2019s military ambitions. The editorial condemned her actions as 'extremely sinister, extremely vicious, and extremely serious,' using the rare triple 'extremely'\u2014a rhetorical signal often associated with severe consequences in official Chinese discourse. The editorial further accused Takaichi of stepping on the 'footprints of historical crimes,' including visits to Yasukuni Shrine, denial of the Nanjing Massacre, and stoking 'China threat' narratives, and warned that her statements reflect a broader trend of Japan undermining the peace constitution, abandoning 'exclusive defense,' and seeking a 'military power' status\u2014posing a 'dangerous sign' of militarism\u2019s resurgence. The article concludes that Takaichi\u2019s actions have effectively been politically condemned by Beijing, with the metaphor of being 'sentenced to political death' being justified given the severity and historical weight of the response.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 05:05 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8oGyQmHoXTl)\n\n**People's Daily: Gao Shi Zaomiao's Taiwan Remarks Are Extremely Sinister, Offensive, and Dangerous**\nOn November 14, 2025, the People's Daily published a commentary titled 'We Will Not Tolerate Gao Shi Zaomiao's Provocative Actions on the Taiwan Issue.'

The Chinese Foreign Ministry escalated tensions, marking the most intense rhetoric toward Tokyo in recent memory. The focus of the backlash is on Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who, following a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC summit in South Korea in late October, made remarks in a parliamentary hearing suggesting that a Chinese military attack on Taiwan could constitute a 'threat to Japan's survival,' thereby activating Japan's right to collective self-defense. Beijing responded with increasing severity, including calls from Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian for Takaichi to 'correct her mistake immediately' and retract her statement, warning that Tokyo would 'bear all consequences' if she did not. Chinese state media and commentators, including sexist rhetoric, intensified their attacks, while the Chinese Consul General in Osaka, Xue Jian, posted on X (formerly Twitter) threatening to 'cut off the dirty head without hesitation'\u2014a post later removed. The incident sparked outrage in Japan, where calls grew for the expulsion of Xue, especially given the 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Lin justified the consul's remarks as a response to Takaichi's 'unjust and dangerous' comments and urged Japan to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, warning, 'Those who play with fire will get burned.' Takaichi denied retracting her statements, explaining she was discussing a worst-case scenario without contradicting past government positions. China views Taiwan as a core red line in international relations, asserting sovereignty and threatening reunification by force if necessary. Japan, which administered Taiwan for 50 years until the end of World War II, remains a key obstacle to China's unification plans due to its deep historical and current bilateral ties with Taiwan. Before becoming prime minister, Takaichi visited Taipei with a parliamentary delegation and described Japan-Taiwan relations as 'almost an alliance,' a statement Beijing called 'unacceptable.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 08:04 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/mondo/2025/11/13/pechino-avvisa-tokyo-se-intervenite-su-taiwan-reagiremo_ea6c7069-71ce-4a0f-9b7e-f065a35a297a.html)\n\n**Tensions Rise in Asia: China's Firm Response to Japan's Taiwan Remarks**\nChina has issued a firm response to Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takai\u00e7i's remarks suggesting Japan might use military force in the event of a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait. In a regular press briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian stated that any such intervention by Japan would be considered an 'aggressive act' and that China would respond with force. Lin emphasized China's commitment to exercising its right to self-defense under the UN Charter and international law, reaffirming the protection of national sovereignty and territorial integrity. He urged Japan to immediately retract its statements, warning it would have to bear the consequences if it did not. Lin also questioned whether Takai\u00e7i\u2019s invocation of a 'national existence crisis' scenario signaled a return to Japan\u2019s past military aggression, accusing Japan of attempting to undermine the post-war international order. Takai\u00e7i had previously described a military intervention in the Taiwan Strait as a threat to Japan\u2019s existence under Japan\u2019s 2015 National Security Law, which permits the use of armed forces in response to attacks on allies that threaten Japan\u2019s survival. While Japan\u2019s leadership has previously protested China\u2019s objections, Takai\u00e7i maintained that his remarks were hypothetical and that he would avoid such statements in the future, but refused to retract them. The article also provides historical context: Taiwan was under Japanese control from 1895 to 1945 following the First Sino-Japanese War, after which it was handed over to the Allied Powers. Following the Chinese Civil War, the Communist Party established the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, while the defeated Kuomintang retreated to Taiwan, claiming to continue the Republic of China. Since 1949, Taiwan has functioned as a de facto independent entity. China continues to assert the 'One China' principle, opposes Taiwan\u2019s diplomatic recognition by other nations, and demands that countries sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. In recent years, China has increased military pressure on Taiwan, explicitly stating it would not rule out the use of force to achieve reunification.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:58 PM\nSource:[Yeni \u00c7a\u011f Gazetesi](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/asyada-gerilim-artiyor-cinden-japonyaya-sert-yanit-979866h.htm)\n\n**China Condemns K\u014dchi's 'National Survival Crisis' Statement on Taiwan, Warns of Direct Retaliation**\nChina's Foreign Ministry's Deputy Spokesperson Lin Jian strongly rebuked Japanese Prime Minister Sanae K\u014dchi's statement in a parliamentary session on November 13, 2025, where she asserted that a conflict over Taiwan could constitute a 'national survival crisis situation' for Japan.

This marks the first time China has publicly called for a retraction of a parliamentary statement. K\u014dchi reiterated that her remarks did not alter the government's longstanding position and refused to retract them.

China's military newspaper, PLA Daily, criticized K\u014dchi's planned revision of three security-related documents, labeling Japan's shift toward a 'war-capable state' as a dangerous move. The Communist Youth League's China Youth Daily called her remarks a 'dangerous provocation to regional peace,' while the English edition of the People's Daily-affiliated Global Times accused K\u014dchi's administration of challenging China's 'red line' on Taiwan just one month after taking office, severely undermining recent efforts to ease tensions between the two nations.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[nikkansports.com](https://www.nikkansports.com/general/news/202511130001420.html)\n\n**China Warns Japan: Military Intervention in Taiwan Strait Would Trigger Forceful Response**\nOn November 13, 2025, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian condemned Japanese Prime Minister Asahi Hayato's remarks during a parliamentary session on November 7, in which she stated that a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait could constitute a 'national survival crisis' for Japan.

He questioned whether Takaichi\u2019s current rhetoric signals a revival of Japanese militarism and a challenge to the post-World War II international order. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also reaffirmed that Taiwan is a sovereign state, with its sovereignty belonging to all Taiwanese people, and that the People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan\u2014this is a widely recognized international fact. China warned Japan against interfering in its internal affairs, calling such actions a manifestation of hegemonic behavior and a threat to global stability. The statement concluded with a warning: 'Those who play with fire will be burned.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 08:58 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/acn/202511130285.aspx)\n\n**Poll: Majority Prefer Dialogue Over Military Buildup for Taiwan's Security**\nA October 2025 poll by Beautiful Island Electron Newspaper, commissioned to Dai Li'an for questionnaire design and analysis and conducted by Beken Market Research, surveyed 1,077 adults aged 20 and above across Taiwan's 22 counties and cities. The survey, conducted between October 20\u201322, 2025, used dual-frame sampling (landline and mobile phones) with a margin of error of \u00b13.0% at a 95% confidence level. Regarding the question 'Which approach better safeguards Taiwan\u2019s security and avoids cross-strait war?', 58.3% of respondents chose 'resuming official talks and easing civilian exchanges', 28.2% selected 'increasing annual defense budget to purchase weapons', and only 3.0% supported 'fully complying with U.S. President Trump\u2019s demands'. Another question asked whether military conflict is inevitable in resolving long-standing political disputes between Taiwan and China; 31.4% agreed (7.7% strongly agreed, 23.7% somewhat agreed), while 60.0% disagreed (32.1% strongly disagreed, 27.9% somewhat disagreed), with 8.6% undecided.

In a National Day speech, Lai warned that authoritarianism is expanding globally, posing 'serious challenges' to the international order. He highlighted that the balance in the Taiwan Strait, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea\u2014and the security of the entire First Island Chain\u2014is under grave threat.

This follows a similar incident on October 3, when six PLA aircraft and seven PLAN vessels were detected, with one sortie crossing into Taiwan's southwestern ADIZ. The MND stated that the Republic of China (ROC) Armed Forces monitored and responded appropriately to the movements. The increased military activity reflects rising tensions between Taiwan and China, with defense experts noting that China's newly unveiled weapon systems are specifically designed to counter Taiwan's asymmetric warfare strategy\u2014based on low-cost, high-impact systems developed over decades to deter a large-scale invasion. Taiwan, which governs itself independently with its own political and economic systems, maintains de facto independence despite China's claim under the 'One China' principle, a dispute rooted in the 1949 Chinese Civil War. Beijing continues to pursue reunification through military, diplomatic, and economic pressure, while Taiwan asserts its sovereignty amid sustained external challenges.

China asserts that the resolution, which resulted in Taiwan's expulsion from the UN and the transfer of its seat to the People's Republic of China (PRC), provides international legal backing for its claim over Taiwan. Taiwan, formally known as the Republic of China (ROC), argues that the resolution does not mention Taiwan and that the PRC has never governed the island, calling China's interpretation 'deliberately deceptive.' The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Taiwan stated that China's narrative aims to create a legal foundation for altering the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and enabling a future military attack. It emphasized that only Taiwan's democratically elected government can represent its 23 million people in the UN and multilateral international forums. China has not renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control and regularly conducts military activities near the island. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement replete with Cold War-era rhetoric, claimed the PRC is the legitimate successor to the government of all China, including Taiwan, following the 1949 revolution. It warned that challenging Resolution 2758 constitutes a challenge to China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as to the authority of the UN. The United States Department of State responded by criticizing China's 'intentional distortion and misuse' of Resolution 2758 as part of broader coercive efforts to isolate Taiwan, affirming that the resolution does not restrict any country's sovereign right to engage substantially with Taiwan.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 12:49 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Brasil](https://br.investing.com/news/world-news/taiwan-diz-que-china-esta-tentando-criar-base-legal-para-ataque-com-interpretacao-de-resolucao-da-onu-1695412)\n\n**China fires water cannons at over 10 Philippine ships - Taipei Times**\nAccording to the article, China Coast Guard fired water cannons at more than 10 Philippine ships near Scarborough Shoal on September 15, 2025, after accusing Manila of an 'illegal' intrusion and a ramming incident. China said the vessels had 'illegally invaded China's territorial waters of the Scarborough Shoal from different directions' and that vessel 3014 had 'disregarded solemn warnings from the Chinese side and deliberately rammed a Chinese coast guard vessel.' China claimed it had lawfully implemented control measures, including verbal warnings, route restrictions and water cannon spraying. The Philippine Coast Guard said it was resupplying more than 35 fishing boats and had encountered 'aggressive actions' by nine Chinese vessels, but did not mention water cannon. A Philippine Maritime Council spokesperson said there was 'no truth' in China's statement and called it 'another case of Chinese disinformation and propaganda.' The incident follows China\u2019s approval of plans to turn the shoal, which Taiwan also claims, into a national nature reserve, a move that could test Manila\u2019s response over the 150\u202fkm\u00b2 triangular chain of reefs. The dispute is part of a broader contest over sovereignty and fishing access in the South China Sea, where China claims almost the entire sea, overlapping the exclusive economic zones of Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.

Cao said the CCP\u2019s 2018 constitutional amendment that declares \"Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People\u2019s Republic of China\" is \"a blatant forgery\" and that the party\u2019s threat of \"\u6b66\u529b\u7d71\u4e00\" (military unification) is \"invasion, murder, arson, and robbery\"\u2014an act he labels \"anti\u2011human, anti\u2011civilization\". He argues that the CCP will inevitably collapse like East Germany, citing the East German fall in 1989\u20131990 as a parallel.\n\nCao also highlighted his own investment of 20\u202fmillion NTD (\u2248$672,300) in the film, noting that the production team plans to publish a scriptbook and novel by the end of September. He quoted the meeting with producer Lin Jinchang on 24\u202fMay\u202f2023, when the idea to film the story was first proposed.\n\nThe article invokes John Locke\u2019s 1689 \"Second Treatise of Government\" to argue that governments must protect life, property, and liberty, and that the CCP\u2019s actions violate these rights. Cao claims the United States will not tolerate a CCP invasion of Taiwan, citing the 1950 MacArthur statement that Taiwan is a \"strategic air\u2011carrier\" for the U.S. and the U.S. State Department\u2019s reaffirmation that UN Resolution\u202f2758 does not confer sovereignty over Taiwan to the CCP.\n\nHe accuses CCP officials of corruption, claiming that their wealth is hidden abroad and would be frozen if Taiwan were attacked. Cao concludes that the CCP\u2019s military threat is merely a bluff and that the real danger lies in covert infiltration and \"Trojan\u2011city slaughter\" within Taiwan\u2019s political system, a theme explored in \"Zero Day Attack\".\n\nKey metrics and dates: 20\u202fmillion NTD investment (\u2248$672,300), meeting on 24\u202fMay\u202f2023, article published 9\u202fSeptember\u202f2025.\n\nQuotes (single\u2011quoted):\n- \"\u6b66\u529b\u7d71\u4e00\"\u5c31\u662f\u4fb5\u7565\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u6bba\u4eba\u653e\u706b\u3001\u6253\u5bb6\u52ab\u820d\u3002\n- \"\u4e2d\u5171\u4e00\u5b9a\u6703\u6b65\u6771\u5fb7\u57ae\u53f0\u7684\u5f8c\u5875\uff0c\u88ab\u6383\u9032\u6b77\u53f2\u7684\u5783\u573e\u5806\u3002\"\n- \"\u7f8e\u570b\u4eba\u4e0d\u6703\u5141\u8a31\u4e2d\u5171\u6b66\u529b\u72af\u53f0\uff0c\u4e0d\u50c5\u56e0\u70ba\u9019\u662f\u72af\u7f6a\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u56e0\u70ba\u6b64\u8209\u6703\u4fb5\u72af\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5229\u76ca\u3002\"\n\nThe piece is a strongly opinionated political critique, presenting the CCP\u2019s actions as criminal and inevitable, and urging vigilance among Taiwanese readers.\n\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 09, 2025 02:46 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/9/9/n14590609.htm)\n\n**Taiwan, China battle it out in competing World War Two narratives**\nThe article reports that as China prepares a mass military parade in Beijing to mark the end of World War\u202fII, Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) are engaged in a heated dispute over who should be credited with the victory.  Taiwan\u2019s top China\u2011policy maker, Chiu\u202fChui\u2011cheng, said on the August\u202f15 anniversary that the Republic of China (ROC) led the war of resistance against Japan, while the PRC\u2019s Communist Party has repeatedly claimed it was the party that led the fight.  Chiu noted that the ROC signed the peace agreement with Japan after the war, whereas the PRC did not exist at that time.  The Mainland Affairs Council, headed by Chiu, said the communists\u2019 strategy during the war was \u201c70\u202f% about strengthening themselves, 20\u202f% dealing with the republican government and 10\u202f% about opposing Japan,\u201d a claim the party has denied.  Taiwan\u2019s defence ministry staged a concert featuring images of World War\u202fII\u2011era republican soldiers and the Flying Tigers, and the programme stated, \u2018History affirms that the War of Resistance was led and won by the Republic of China.\u2019  In response, the PRC\u2019s official newspaper, the People\u2019s Daily, warned against \u201cdistort[ing] and falsify[ing] the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s role as the country\u2019s backbone\u201d in fighting Japan.  The PRC claims the victory belongs to all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, and celebrates that the war\u2019s end in 1945 led to Taiwan\u2019s return to Chinese rule.  Taiwan\u2019s President Lai\u202fChing\u2011te posted on Facebook that aggression will be defeated, alluding to Beijing\u2019s military threats.  The PRC says it is the successor state to the ROC and that Taiwan is an inherent part of Beijing\u2019s territory, a view Taipei strongly rejects.  Taiwan\u2019s government urged its citizens not to attend the Chinese parade, warning it would reinforce Beijing\u2019s territorial claims.  Veteran Pan, who fled to Taiwan after the civil war, said, \u2018I can\u2019t say anything good about the communists,\u2019 and viewed the parade as unrelated to him.

Trump made this statement in an interview with Fox News, which was published by Newsweek. According to Trump, Xi said, 'I will never do it while you are president.' Trump replied, 'Well, I appreciate that, but he also added, 'But I am very patient, and China is very patient.' Trump did not specify when Xi made this promise. The first confirmed phone call between the two leaders during Trump's second term took place in June. Newsweek reached out to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment, but received no response. The magazine notes that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could lead to a military response from the US, resulting in a direct conflict between two nuclear superpowers and potentially catastrophic consequences for the world. China has repeatedly stated that the 'Taiwan question' is a top priority in Sino-US relations and insists on the 'one China' principle. Taiwan, with a population of around 23 million, is a partially recognized democratic state that China considers a 'rebellious province' and part of its territory. The island's government rejects the 'one country, two systems' model promoted by China since the 1980s. In recent years, China has conducted large-scale military exercises off the coast of Taiwan, which some military analysts have seen as a rehearsal for an invasion. The passage of military ships from other countries through the strait separating Taiwan from mainland China is seen by Beijing as a provocation. Xi has repeatedly stated that Taiwan will be 'reunified' with mainland China and has set a deadline of 2027 for establishing Chinese sovereignty over the island. Trump's second term is set to end in early 2029.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 11:15 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/tramp-si-czinpin-poobesal-licno-cto-kitaj-ne-vtorgnetsa-na-tajvan/a-73669642)\n\n**China and Taiwan: Understanding the Ongoing Conflict**\nThe article explains the ongoing conflict between China and Taiwan, tracing its roots to the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, when the Nationalist government under Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan after losing to the Communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Since then, two entities have existed: the People's Republic of China (PRC) on the mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, which continued to claim legitimacy as China's rightful government. Over time, international recognition shifted to the PRC, culminating in Taiwan losing its UN seat in 1972 and the U.S. recognizing Beijing in 1979 while pledging to support Taiwan militarily. Taiwan evolved into a democratic, economically advanced society, becoming a global leader in semiconductor manufacturing through companies like TSMC. It is now regarded as one of the most liberal and democratic nations in Asia, having legalized same-sex marriage in 2019. Despite China's official stance that Taiwan is an 'independent province' and its repeated threats of 'reunification' by force, most Taiwanese identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese, especially after observing the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong. Analysts warn that a military invasion could occur as early as 2027 or 2049, though China may instead pursue non-military strategies like economic blockades or cyberattacks. The article notes that while China claims peaceful reunification, current developments suggest growing tension and a diminishing likelihood of peaceful resolution.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: May 23, 2024 10:54 AM\nSource:[sauerlandkurier.de](https://www.sauerlandkurier.de/politik/china-taiwan-konflikt-fotostrecke-zr-91693880.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts forecast a very low probability that armed conflict between Taiwan (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) will result in at least 100 deaths before January 1, 2026. The consensus is overwhelming across a wide range of analytical perspectives\u2014including Military Analysis, Crisis and Probabilistic Risk Assessment, Diplomacy (Track II, Mediation), multiple paradigms in International Relations (Realism, Liberalism, Security Dilemma), and Strategic Studies (Deterrence, Escalation), as well as Asian regional expertise.\n\nKey points of agreement include:\n- No direct lethal exchanges between ROC and PRC military or law enforcement have occurred since 2021, and none in decades have come close to the 100-death threshold.\n- Rhetorical escalation, military maneuvers, and gray-zone activities are intense and ongoing, but these serve as deterrents and signaling rather than indicators of imminent large-scale combat.\n- All experts heavily weigh the historical base rate, which shows no such incident since the 1950s, despite repeated major crises.\n- While recent factors (greater Japanese rhetoric, new US arms sales, sharper PRC threats) incrementally raise the theoretical risk of miscalculation or black swan events, strong crisis management channels, deterrence dynamics, mutual risk aversion, and short time to resolution overwhelmingly favor stability.\n- Both public opinion in Taiwan and broader international (US, Japanese) postures reinforce incentives to avoid triggering a catastrophic conflict, with domestic and international costs for any major escalation seen as prohibitive for all sides.\n- The short time remaining before the resolution deadline makes spontaneous, large-scale mobilization and conflict highly improbable, with no signs of imminent preparation or intent for such escalation.\n\nProbabilities assigned by forecasters range narrowly from 1% to 6%, with most assessments clustered in the 1%-5% range. Scenarios for a 'Yes' outcome (100+ deaths) almost uniformly require either an unprecedented accident/miscalculation or sudden, deliberate escalation that is not forecasted by current indicators. All experts expect the status quo (high tension, no kinetic exchange causing mass casualties) to persist through the end of 2025.",
