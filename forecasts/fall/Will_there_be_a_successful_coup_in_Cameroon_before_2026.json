The regime has a history of surviving intense unrest via loyalty, patronage, and brutal force. Opposition leader Tchiroma\u2019s calls for escalation have largely been met with repression. Despite vocal and sometimes violent opposition, the military is widely seen as under tight regime control, and Biya\u2019s ruling coalition, while aging, is motivated by survival and deeply entrenched. International criticism has not translated into support for regime change, nor has there been a rapid mobilization of the kind of trans-elite alliance seen in successful coups elsewhere.

The possibility of a health crisis causing regime paralysis remains, but such an event would still require clear military or armed group initiative, which shows no present signs of germinating.

Notably, critiques of the one high estimate (22%) reinforced the consensus around lower single-digit or just above single-digit probabilities, heavily grounded in historical coup base rates and the absence of near-term warning indicators.

No new evidence or argument has emerged that would warrant increasing my probability: the risk is above historical background but remains well short of the 'acute' threshold some have suggested. There is a slight argument for trimming downward, given the strong cluster of expert views in the 7\u201313% range and no credible open-source signals of imminent armed group organization or elite breakdown, but the possibility of an internal and opaque palace coup\u2014while still low\u2014is not zero.

Those arguing for a higher probability were repeatedly critiqued for neglecting the decisive role of the cohesive, loyal security apparatus and mistaking volatility in protest dynamics for signs of regime collapse. As a Fragile States Index specialist, I also recognize the importance of not conflating chronic instability with acute vulnerability to successful coups. However, in support of my initial estimate, the aggregate of expert opinions skews closer to 6\u201310%, suggesting my 15% may slightly overestimate odds. The only justification for an estimate above 10% is the regime's extreme longevity, Biya's age, and lack of clear succession, which do elevate tail risk.

Opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary, a former ally of Biya, claims he is the rightful winner and has called for continued rallies and civil disobedience. HRW reported that while some protests involved violence and attacks on police, the state response included 'lethal force and mass arrests' of protesters and civilians. At least six individuals are detained at the State Defence Secretariat in Yaound\u00e9, a facility where HRW has 'documented routine use of torture.' Ilaria Allegrozzi, a senior HRW Africa researcher, stated, 'The violent crackdown on protesters and ordinary citizens across Cameroon lays bare a deepening pattern of repression that casts a dark cloud over the election.' She urged authorities to immediately release those detained for peaceful protest, investigate and prosecute security forces responsible for abuses, and ensure fair trials for those involved in violent acts.

Since late October, protests led by opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma\u2014formerly a minister and self-proclaimed winner\u2014have swept major cities, mobilizing youth demanding change. The Cameroonian government acknowledged 'several dozen' deaths, without providing an exact figure. HRW reported that some demonstrations turned violent, with protesters throwing stones at police and setting fire to public buildings and private property, prompting security forces to respond with lethal force. Ilaria Allegrozzi, HRW\u2019s Africa researcher, stated that the crackdown reveals a deepening repression casting a 'dark cloud' over the election. Authorities claimed to have arrested 'several hundred' people, with one group of 149 volunteer lawyers estimating up to 2,000 detainees, including minors. HRW expressed concern that some were held in a detention center where systematic torture has been documented. Allegrozzi demanded the immediate release of all individuals detained for peaceful protest or expressing opposition to the government, emphasizing that any violence must be prosecuted appropriately with full due process. HRW also highlighted that Biya abolished presidential term limits in 2008 and has systematically suppressed opposition and dissent, noting a 'closed civic space' with severe restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and association in the months preceding the election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 10:54 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/83RG6ZQ)\n\n**Human Rights Watch accuses Cameroon of killings, torture and mass arrests after disputed election**\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused Cameroonian security forces of using lethal force, committing killings, and conducting arbitrary mass arrests in a violent crackdown following the disputed October 12, 2025, presidential election. According to HRW\u2019s report released in Nairobi, police and gendarmes fired live ammunition and tear gas to disperse opposition-led protests challenging the re-election of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who was declared the winner with 53.66% of the vote on October 27. HRW documented killings, injuries, and detentions through interviews with 20 witnesses, including relatives of victims, lawyers, and opposition figures. UN sources reported 48 deaths, while opposition groups claimed 55. HRW\u2019s senior Africa researcher, Ilaria Allegrozzi, urged the authorities to immediately investigate and prosecute responsible security forces, release all detainees held for peaceful protest, and uphold due process, including rights to bail and a fair trial. Biya\u2019s main challenger, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, declared himself the victor and alleged widespread fraud. HRW reported that hundreds, including minors, were detained, with lawyers estimating up to 2,000 people held nationwide, many without judicial review. Cameroon\u2019s communication minister, Rene Emmanuel Sadi, defended the security operations, citing 'illegal gatherings, roadblocks, and violent mobs,' and warned that 'those fomenting unrest will face the full force of the law.'

Tchiroma, who contested the election and claims he was the rightful winner despite official results declaring President Paul Biya the victor, made the demand in a video posted on social media on November 10, 2025. He stated, 'I will never lower my stance until my people are free,' and accused security forces of unjust arrests during post-election protests. The election, which saw 92-year-old Biya declared the winner by the Constitutional Court, has triggered widespread unrest. Biya, who has ruled Cameroon for 43 years, was sworn in for an eighth term, extending his presidency for another seven years. According to the United Nations, at least 48 people were killed in post-election violence, with many believed to have been shot by police during clashes with protesters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 05:09 AM\nSource:[allafrica.com](https://allafrica.com/stories/202511100054.html)\n\n**Africa should abolish polls and return to fiefdoms and monarchies**\nThe article argues that elections in Africa are systematically flawed and often fraudulent, citing historical and recent examples to advocate for abolishing polls and reverting to fiefdoms and monarchies. It references Charles Dunbar Burgess King\u2019s 1927 Liberian presidential election, where he received 230,000 votes out of a registered electorate of 19,000\u20141,211% of votes\u2014highlighting a pattern of electoral fraud. The piece then details recent elections in Tanzania, where President Samia Suluhu won 98% of the vote amid widespread suppression of opposition, including the imprisonment of opposition leader Tundu Lissu on treason charges and the disqualification of candidate Luhaga Mpina. In Ivory Coast, President Alassane Ouattara secured 91% of the vote, while in Cameroon, 92-year-old Paul Biya won with 54% despite health concerns and a warning from his daughter against voting for him. Tunisia\u2019s Kais Saied won 90.69% amid repression, and the Central African Republic\u2019s Faustin-Archange Touad\u00e9ra assumed power through a disputed 2020 election. In Guinea, military leader Mamadi Doumbouya is expected to oversee elections, raising concerns about manipulation. In Uganda, opposition leaders Kizza Besigye and Bobi Wine face imprisonment and state violence, suggesting a sham process. The article predicts Kenya\u2019s 2026 election as the 'grand finale' of this cycle, warning that without reform, Africa should abandon elections and return to fiefdoms and monarchies. The author concludes with a satirical yet critical tone, calling the current system 'madness' and questioning the legitimacy of electoral processes across the continent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 03:10 AM\nSource:[Standard Digital News - Kenya](https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/opinion/article/2001534050/africa-should-abolish-polls-and-return-to-fiefdoms-and-monarchies)\n\n**After Them, the Flood: The Struggle to Uphold Democratic Rule in Africa**\nThe article, published on November 13, 2025, by Tunisian political thinker and philosophy professor Mohamed Ben Salem, analyzes the persistent instability in Africa due to political leaders' prolonged retention of power. It highlights that peaceful transitions of power are rare across African nations. The piece cites examples such as Ivory Coast\u2019s President Alassane Ouattara, who secured a fourth term with 89.77% of votes amid widespread suppression of opposition and broken promises; Tanzania\u2019s Samia Suluhu Hassan, who won 97.66% of votes following a violent election aftermath in which over 700 people were killed; Cameroon\u2019s Paul Biya, who has ruled for 42 years; and other long-serving leaders including Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma (Togo, 20 years), Denis Sassou Nguesso (Congo, 40 years), Paul Kagame (Rwanda, 31 years), and Teodoro Obiang Nguema (Equatorial Guinea, 45 years). The author argues that these leaders lack genuine public respect based on achievements, and their grip on power has undermined democratic development. Instead, elections have become theatrical performances followed by cycles of violence, ethnic polarization, and civil conflict, as seen in Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan. The article calls for a redefinition of elections as forums for policy debate rather than personal rivalry, emphasizing the need to cultivate democratic values, civic responsibility, and peaceful conflict resolution. It stresses that democracy requires mutual recognition, continuous negotiation, and respect for the rule of law\u2014qualities absent in many African autocratic regimes.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:50 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/opinion/%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%87%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B3%D9%91%D9%83-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**HRW slams Cameroon killings, arrests after disputed vote**\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has condemned Cameroon for lethal force and mass arrests following widespread protests against the disputed re-election of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, declared the winner on October 12, 2025.

Ilaria Allegrozzi, HRW\u2019s Africa researcher, stated that the crackdown reveals a deepening repression casting a 'dark cloud' over the election. Authorities claimed to have arrested 'several hundred' people, with one group of 149 volunteer lawyers estimating up to 2,000 detainees, including minors. HRW expressed concern that some were held in a detention center where systematic torture has been documented. Allegrozzi demanded the immediate release of all individuals detained for peaceful protest or expressing opposition to the government, emphasizing that any violence must be prosecuted appropriately with full due process. HRW also highlighted that Biya abolished presidential term limits in 2008 and has systematically suppressed opposition and dissent, noting a 'closed civic space' with severe restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, and association in the months preceding the election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 10:54 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/83RG6ZQ)\n\n**Human Rights Watch accuses Cameroon of killings, torture and mass arrests after disputed election**\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused Cameroonian security forces of using lethal force, committing killings, and conducting arbitrary mass arrests in a violent crackdown following the disputed October 12, 2025, presidential election. According to HRW\u2019s report released in Nairobi, police and gendarmes fired live ammunition and tear gas to disperse opposition-led protests challenging the re-election of 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who was declared the winner with 53.66% of the vote on October 27. HRW documented killings, injuries, and detentions through interviews with 20 witnesses, including relatives of victims, lawyers, and opposition figures. UN sources reported 48 deaths, while opposition groups claimed 55. HRW\u2019s senior Africa researcher, Ilaria Allegrozzi, urged the authorities to immediately investigate and prosecute responsible security forces, release all detainees held for peaceful protest, and uphold due process, including rights to bail and a fair trial. Biya\u2019s main challenger, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, declared himself the victor and alleged widespread fraud. HRW reported that hundreds, including minors, were detained, with lawyers estimating up to 2,000 people held nationwide, many without judicial review. Cameroon\u2019s communication minister, Rene Emmanuel Sadi, defended the security operations, citing 'illegal gatherings, roadblocks, and violent mobs,' and warned that 'those fomenting unrest will face the full force of the law.'

Biya was inaugurated on November 6, 2024. On November 9, Tchiroma broke his silence with a video message accusing the regime of 'state-sponsored terrorism,' 'ethnic cleansing,' and arbitrary arrests. He demanded the release of all political detainees within 48 hours. Despite speculation that Nigerian authorities may be restricting his movements to preserve relations with Yaound\u00e9, Tchiroma has signaled his intent to continue an escalating confrontation that has moved beyond legal channels into a protracted war of attrition. He has organized violent protests, resulting in deaths and destruction of commercial infrastructure, which he claims were caused by infiltrated agents. He also called for a three-day general strike under the slogan 'Ghost City,' though responses were inconsistent. Tchiroma threatened to target prisons, stating that after 48 hours, the Cameroonian people would have the right to defend themselves and reclaim their members by all means. This escalation follows a wave of arrests of his supporters across the country, with unclear reasons and identities of detainees. According to Tchiroma\u2019s lawyer, 121 people\u2014including 9 minors\u2014are being held at police and gendarmerie centers in Yaound\u00e9, while about 30 others were transferred to Ntuyi in the Centre Region after detention at Central Police Station No. 1. The stated goal of these detentions is to isolate Tchiroma and dismantle his networks. President Biya, drawing on decades of experience in silencing political rivals\u2014such as John Fru Ndi in 1992 and Maurice Kamto in 2018\u2014faces opposition with confidence, relying on institutional legitimacy and a planned routine cabinet reshuffle. He has maintained a low political profile, appearing only in routine state ceremonies and issuing no new political statements beyond his inauguration speech. Despite control over the military and administration, the regime acknowledges that the war of attrition could strain the already struggling economy, potentially undermining political stability. Minister of Regional Administration Paul Atanga Nji is leading a hardline approach, while Biya praised security forces in a speech despite credible allegations from human rights organizations that they used live ammunition against protesters, resulting in dozens of deaths. Tchiroma is attempting to damage the regime\u2019s international image, particularly among key European and U.S. economic partners. The report raises questions about Biya\u2019s ability to contain the crisis, even with institutional legitimacy and potential openings to moderate opposition figures like Kabral Libe. While Biya announced economic stimulus measures, their effectiveness in resolving the conflict with Tchiroma remains uncertain, as public trust in his promises continues to decline and political tensions persist.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 04:35 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/politics/2025/11/11/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b6-%d8%aa%d8%b4%d9%8a%d8%b1%d9%88%d9%85%d8%a7-%d9%8a%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%af%d9%89-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%a6%d9%8a%d8%b3-%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a)\n\n**Paul Biya Declares He Has Turned the Page on the Presidential Election \u2013 237 Actu**\nCameroonian President Paul Biya declared on November 11, 2025, via his official Facebook page, that he has 'turned the page' on the October 2025 presidential election, urging all citizens to join in a 'salutary struggle' and emphasizing that the time is now for national unity.

In a nearly five-minute social media speech, Bakary urged 92-year-old incumbent President Paul Biya\u2014Africa\u2019s longest-serving head of state, in power for 43 years\u2014to concede, stating, 'Our victory is clear. It must be respected.' Bakary, a former transport and communication minister under Biya, resigned from government in June 2025 and launched a surprise presidential bid, accusing Biya\u2019s administration of mismanaging the country\u2019s oil and cocoa wealth and failing to deliver basic services. His campaign gained momentum with endorsements from a coalition of opposition parties and civic groups known as the Union for Change, which supports him as a transitional leader to carry out institutional audits and reforms. Despite his claims, official results remain pending, as Cameroon\u2019s Constitutional Council has until October 26, 2025, to validate and release the final tally. The government, through Minister of Territorial Administration Paul Atanga Nji, has warned that any unilateral announcement of results constitutes 'high treason.'

Biya, who has ruled since 1982, will become the first head of state to serve past the age of 100 if he completes his seventh term. Cameroon's presidential term is seven years with no term limits, enabling indefinite re-election. In the previous election, Biya received 71% of the vote. This election featured 11 opposition candidates, but the most prominent was barred from running after the electoral commission rejected his registration, a decision upheld by the constitutional council, leaving Biya without meaningful competition. He conducted minimal campaigning. Biya\u2019s rule reflects a broader trend in Africa, where five of the world\u2019s seven longest-serving presidents are African. These include Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo of Equatorial Guinea (46 years), Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo (46 years), Yoweri Museveni of Uganda (40 years), Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea (since 1993 without elections), and Salva Kiir Mayardit of South Sudan (since 2011, delaying elections). Experts attribute the persistence of long-serving leaders to historical, geopolitical, and social factors, including the use of patronage networks, suppression of dissent, and the portrayal of leaders as national liberators. While some leaders have been ousted recently\u2014such as the Bongo family in Gabon (2023), Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe (2017), and Omar al-Bashir in Sudan (2019)\u2014there are signs of change: Seychelles saw a peaceful opposition victory in 2025, and Senegal\u2019s President Macky Sall stepped down after mass protests in 2024.

At 92 years old, Biya seeks to extend his presidency through 2032, which would make him 99 at the end of his term. Over eight million voters, including 34,000 abroad, participated in 31,000 polling centers. Results are expected by October 26, though opposition groups have raised concerns about unequal conditions and lack of transparency. Biya, who has been in power since 1982 after the resignation of Ahmadou Ahidjo, has won all seven elections since then. While his rule has brought formal political stability, it has also been marked by accusations of authoritarianism, repression, and corruption. Biya stated, 'The challenges we face are increasingly urgent. In such a situation, I cannot evade my mission,' without presenting a concrete program. His health, which has drawn persistent speculation due to his frequent stays in Europe, remains a concern, with real governance falling to his inner circle and senior officials of the ruling RDPC party. He faces nine opposition candidates, including Bello Bouba Maigari and Issa Tchiroma Bakary\u2014former allies now critical of his rule\u2014who draw support in the impoverished, conflict-ridden northern regions affected by Boko Haram and cross-border armed groups.

As October 3 is a public holiday in Germany (German Unity Day), Deutsche Welle is offering a special broadcast focusing on the stakes of this election. To maintain power for over 40 years, Biya has relied on a mix of political strategy, centralization of authority, and a repressive system. His main opposition is fragmented, with 11 candidates initially approved, but the field has narrowed due to withdrawals and endorsements. Most Cameroonian citizens do not believe a democratic transition will occur in 2025, and neither the ruling RDPC party nor the broader country is prepared for a post-Biya era.

According to Thabang, 'Some of the challenges of African development reside in the reluctance of leaders to leave power, even when their term is long expired.' Thabang also notes that 'the plague of African leadership is rooted in the negative ideology of long-term power, often referred to as dictatorship or autocracy in some states.' The article highlights the consequences of such leadership, including underdevelopment, dictatorship, elite domination, and corruption. It also warns that the return of Biya to power could lead to instability and coups, as seen in neighboring countries like Mali and Burkina Faso.

He has been in office since 1982, making him one of the longest-serving heads of state in the world. As the presidential election approaches on October 12, a question is being asked: will Biya run for an eighth term? The opposition is weakened and divided, while the population is resigned to the current situation. Biya's regime has consolidated its power through constitutional reforms, the abolition of term limits, and tight control over institutions. The 2008 constitutional amendment removed the two-term limit for presidents, allowing for indefinite re-elections. Although there has been no official announcement, several indicators suggest that the regime is preparing the ground for Biya's new candidacy. The ruling party, RDPC, has stated that Biya remains the 'best choice', while his potential successor, his son Franck Biya, has not been clearly designated. Biya's silence on the matter has maintained the ambiguity, reinforcing the regime's control. At 91, Biya's advanced age raises questions about his ability to lead the country, which faces numerous challenges, including insecurity in Anglophone regions, persistent poverty, endemic corruption, and irregular economic growth. The question of succession becomes crucial, but is carefully avoided by the regime, fueling internal tensions. If Biya were to run for re-election, it would be his eighth term, prolonging a rule that raises numerous criticisms on democratic and ethical grounds. Such a candidacy would also pose problems in terms of medium-term stability, particularly in the event of a sudden power vacuum. Cameroon is at a crossroads, between the perpetuation of a personal power and the people's aspiration for change. The upcoming election will be decisive.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: July 23, 2025 06:51 AM\nSource:[settimananews.it](https://www.settimananews.it/informazione-internazionale/paul-biya-verso-un-ottavo-mandato/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Forecasters broadly agree that while the risk of a successful coup in Cameroon before January 1, 2026, is elevated compared to historical norms\u2014largely due to Paul Biya's advanced age, unprecedented post-election unrest, intense repression, and recent coup contagion in West and Central Africa\u2014the probability remains low. All experts emphasize key stabilizing factors: the cohesion and loyalty of Cameroon's security forces, the entrenched nature of Biya's personalized and patrimonial regime, the absence of credible elite or military defections, and the regime's demonstrated ability to rapidly suppress dissent through violence and patronage. Although regional precedent (recent coups in Niger, Gabon, Burkina Faso) and Biya's age nudge risk upward, the lack of clear fractures among military or governing elites, successful coup-proofing since the failed 1984 coup, and a fragmented, militarily weak opposition keep the risk from rising further. Most experts envision a coup scenario only if there is a sudden health crisis or acute succession vacuum leading to elite fragmentation\u2014signs of which are currently absent. Probabilities offered range mostly from 4% to 15%, with one outlier of 22% reflecting a slight overweighting of structural instability indicators and visible elite cracks. Commonly, forecasters judge that, barring an unforeseen trigger, sustained regime survival is most probable through the close of 2025 despite the fraught, violent post-election environment.",
