While the water crisis is genuinely severe\u2014with technical near-collapse in some reservoirs\u2014mitigation steps are ongoing and the government\u2019s focus remains on maintaining order. For an evacuation to occur in the next five weeks, several low-probability events must all align: complete water failure, failed mitigations, uncontrollable unrest, and a regime decision to risk destabilization through an admission of logistical defeat. Viewed through the lens of crisis management, the next month is likelier to see continued appeals, stricter rationing, and possibly very localized voluntary or informal migration, but not a formal, large-scale, public evacuation order as required by the resolution criteria. The plausible 'yes' scenarios demand an almost unprecedented disaster/response failure, which current evidence and regime history do not support. Therefore, the probability remains very low but nonzero, since total water supply failure would force government action regardless of planning or preference.",

No formal evacuation order for 100,000+ people is issued; at most, some limited encouragement for temporary 'out-migration' (students, civil servants) or targeted evacuations of at-risk neighborhoods less than the threshold. Crisis persists but is managed via improvisation and denial.",
            "yes_scenario": "By mid-December, the water supply to large sectors of Tehran fails altogether, coinciding with infrastructure disruptions, rising disease risk, and/or incipient protests. Faced with clear, acute risks of mass disorder or a major humanitarian disaster with global media coverage, political calculations shift: state authority (possibly with military or IRGC backing) orders the evacuation of at least 100,000 residents from the most affected districts, likely justified as a temporary 'emergency evacuation.' Order is made publicly and officially, with strict requirements for compliance; busing and temporary encampments are established outside metropolitan Tehran.",
            "final_reasoning": "The drought in Tehran is historically severe and the crisis rhetoric unprecedented, with President Pezeshkian repeatedly warning of possible evacuation. However, all recent actions\u2014cloud seeding, rationing plans, and public statements from other officials\u2014demonstrate a clear preference for improvisation, delay, and denial over decisive and risky measures like mass evacuation. Government spokespersons are categorical that evacuation is 'impractical' and emphasize alternative approaches. The technical, logistical, and political barriers to evacuating even 100,000 residents within weeks are immense, and weather uncertainty (possibility of sudden winter rain or cloud seeding success) gives the regime plausible pretext to postpone decisions until after the 2025\u201326 rainy season. Historically, the Islamic Republic has avoided large-scale public admissions of failure and prefers to ride out crises with incremental steps rather than decisive ruptures. While the window for catastrophe remains open and has, arguably, never been closer, the base rate for such unprecedented government-ordered evacuations in Iran (or anywhere in the Middle East) is vanishingly low, even in the face of state collapse-level stress. Given the government's aversion to loss of control, commitment to regime stability, and multi-layered denial culture, the probability of an official evacuation order as defined (>=100,000 residents before Jan 1, 2026) is low, but not zero. I estimate a probability of 8%.",

True, you mention the window for disaster cannot be 'categorically ruled out,' but intelligence methodology is about likelihood, not mere possibility. With water cuts, the government will ration, fragment, and gamble rigidly against the political suicide of an evacuation decree.

President Masoud Pezeshkian warned in November 2024 that Tehran might need to be evacuated if rainfall does not occur by December, sparking public panic. In response, Iranian government spokesperson Fatemeh Mokhberani stated on November 18, 2025, that evacuating the capital is 'impossible and unfeasible' due to its massive population and logistical challenges. She emphasized that the government has 'serious plans' to address the crisis, including cloud seeding using silver iodide, water rationing, and water transfers from other sources. The crisis stems from six consecutive years of drought, climate change, inefficient agricultural water use (accounting for 90% of national consumption), illegal well drilling, over-extraction of groundwater causing land subsidence at 300 mm/year (60 times the critical threshold), and damage from the 12-day Israel-Iran conflict in summer 2024. Tehran recorded only 2.3 mm of rainfall by early November 2024, an 81% drop from the historical average. Key reservoirs like Latian and Amir Kabir have dropped below 14 million cubic meters from a previous capacity of 500 million. The crisis has spread nationwide, with reservoir levels in West and East Azerbaijan provinces falling to single-digit percentages, and economic and political instability fears intensifying amid international sanctions. Experts remain skeptical about the effectiveness of cloud seeding due to low atmospheric humidity.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 11:14 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0639\u0643\u0627\u0638](https://www.okaz.com.sa/variety/na/2222769)\n\n**Iran on the Brink of a Nervous Crisis: Water, Energy, and Existential Stress**\nIran is facing a deepening crisis marked by water scarcity, energy shortages, and environmental degradation. In 2024\u20132025, Iran achieved a historic record by purchasing nearly 12 million tons of wheat from domestic farmers under its guaranteed purchase program, nearly securing self-sufficiency in cereals. However, much of the agricultural sector remains focused on water-intensive crops like pistachios, primarily for export, accelerating groundwater depletion and increasing vulnerability to shortages. Rice, a dietary staple, is heavily imported\u2014mostly from India, which supplies over four-fifths of annual needs\u2014while animal feed maize is mainly sourced from Brazil. Contaminated water and land subsidence are worsening, with studies from Tehran\u2019s water and sanitation company (Abfa) and the Iranian Water Research Institute showing a 60\u201370 cm drop in groundwater levels in Shahriyar, linked to over-pumping and soil deformation. In July 2025, a record heatwave exceeding 50\u00b0C in southwestern cities caused unprecedented electricity demand, straining an aging grid due to austerity-driven underinvestment. As a result, daily power outages\u2014lasting up to four hours\u2014have become routine in Tehran and 28 other cities, disrupting households, businesses, and public services. Citizens report dire conditions: residents struggle to access clean water, face blocked elevators, and carry water manually. Social media posts highlight the suffering of students and caregivers. In response, proposals to relocate the capital to Mokran on the southeastern coast have resurfaced in early 2025, though no decision has been made. Supporters cite pollution, subsidence, and water shortages in Tehran; opponents argue the plan is unrealistic and costly, advocating instead for modernization of the current capital. The crisis reflects the cumulative impact of past political choices, climate constraints, international sanctions, regional tensions, and the real threat of military escalation. For many Iranians, this daily hardship fuels a profound sense of injustice and despair over a future without hope.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 10:27 AM\nSource:[orientxxi.info](https://orientxxi.info/magazine/l-iran-au-bord-de-la-crise-de-nerfs,8478)\n\n**Iran Seeks Alternatives to Evacuating Tehran Amid Historic Drought Period**\nIran's government has dismissed the idea of evacuating Tehran, deeming it impractical, despite President Masoud Pezeshkian's earlier warning that water rationing may be necessary by December and evacuation might be required if no rainfall occurs.

According to Mohammad Mehdi Javadianzadeh, head of the Organisation for Development and Utilization of Modern Meteoric Water Technologies, renewable water resources have declined from an annual average of 128 billion cubic metres two decades ago to about 80 billion cubic metres today. Nationwide dams are nearly empty, and over 90% of water is consumed by agriculture, much through inefficient irrigation, accelerating groundwater depletion and land subsidence. Authorities warn that without significant rainfall, Tehran could face water rationing and, in extreme cases, evacuation. The cloud seeding project will run until mid-May 2026, using aircraft and drones in favorable precipitation systems. Javadianzadeh stated, 'We are trying to carry out the operation on all systems entering the country that are favourable for fertilisation,' with missions over Tehran Province pending confirmation of conditions. The technique involves injecting silver iodide or potassium iodide into clouds to stimulate precipitation. Satellite and local reports indicated rainfall in northwestern provinces on November 15 and snowfall at a northern Tehran ski resort\u2014the first this year. Meteorologists reported that autumn rainfall was down by approximately 89% compared to long-term averages, marking the driest period in 50 years. Officials are also planning penalties for households and businesses exceeding water quotas. Ahmad Vezifeh, head of Iran\u2019s National Crisis and Drought Management Centre, described reservoir levels in Tehran, West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, and Central provinces as 'critical,' with capacities reduced to just a few percent. Public concern has risen, with hundreds gathering in Tehran and other cities to pray for rain. The drought has worsened electricity shortages, increasing reliance on fossil-fuel power plants as hydropower output declines. During summer, government offices in Tehran and other cities have periodically closed to conserve energy, sparking complaints from businesses over lost revenue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 04:21 PM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/iran-launches-first-cloud-seeding-of-water-year-amid-worst-drought-in-decades-411799/)\n\n**Iran Faces Unprecedented Water Crisis, Tehran Residents May Be Evacuated**\nIran's water crisis has reached unprecedented levels, with President Mas'ud Pezeshkiyon warning on November 6, 2025, that residents of Tehran may need to be evacuated due to a complete collapse in water supply.

As of November 17, 2025, Tehran had received only 1 millimeter of rainfall for the entire year\u2014unprecedented in a century. Despite the start of the rainy season over 50 days prior, more than 20 provinces had not seen any rain. Water reservoirs with storage below 5% have increased from 8 to 32. The government has initiated cloud-seeding operations, restricted bottled water purchases, and President Masoud Pezeshkian warned of potential evacuation of Tehran residents by mid-December. In response, people across Iran, including in religious sites in northern Tehran, have begun praying for rain, recalling historical miracles such as the 1944 drought in Qom, where three days of collective prayer reportedly led to heavy rain. Religious leaders, including Grand Ayatollah Javadi Amoli, have suggested the drought may be divine punishment for societal and moral failings. Former environmental official Kaveh Madani, now based in Canada, recalled being silenced for warning of 'water resource bankruptcy' and now questions public understanding of climate change. Water expert Mostafa Fadaei Fard expressed skepticism about nationwide evacuation, asking whether it would be justified if no rain occurs by late December. The crisis has escalated to the point where President Pezeshkian\u2019s evacuation warning underscores the severity of the situation, raising concerns over whether Iran is nearing a state of national collapse.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 10:35 AM\nSource:[www.ntdtv.com](https://www.ntdtv.com/b5/2025/11/17/a104039176.html)\n\n**Drought in Tehran, Flash Floods in Western Iran: Contrasting Crises Amid Record Dryness and Devastating Floods**\nIran is experiencing extreme weather contrasts: severe drought in the capital, Tehran, where water rationing may soon be introduced and residents may need to be relocated, while flash floods have devastated western Iran, particularly in Ilam Province's Shahrek Hejranie village. Heavy rainfall caused rapid flooding, submerging homes and vehicles, with emergency teams deployed to assist 40 affected families. A viral video on social media shows fast-moving floodwaters on village roads, with cars partially submerged and homes inundated. Another video from Marivan in western Iran shows streets flooded with strong water currents. The situation is exacerbated by a 11% deficit in annual rainfall\u2014making it the driest autumn in 50 years\u2014and the near-total drying of Lake Urmia, Iran\u2019s largest lake, now reduced to a salt flat. To combat the drought, authorities conducted cloud-seeding operations in the Urmia Basin and plan to extend them to eastern and western Azerbaijan. The Iranian government is also preparing to impose penalties on excessive water use. On Friday, hundreds gathered in a Tehran mosque to pray for rain. The National Center for Climate and Drought Crisis Management reported that reservoirs in Tehran, West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan, and Markazi are at single-digit levels.

The first operation took place in the Urmia Lake basin on November 16, 2025, marking the first such effort of the hydrological year, which begins in September. Urmia Lake, the largest lake in Iran located in the northwest mountains, has been shrinking since 1995 due to prolonged drought. Additional seeding operations are planned for East and West Azerbaijan provinces. The technique involves injecting chemicals like silver iodide into clouds to induce rainfall. Iran announced last year that it had developed its own cloud seeding technology. The country is experiencing its driest autumn in 50 years, with rainfall this year 89% below the long-term average. Despite this, rain was reported in several western and northwestern regions on November 15. In Tehran, precipitation levels are at their lowest in a century, and half of Iran\u2019s provinces have seen no rainfall in months. Water levels in reservoirs feeding multiple provinces have reached historic lows. On November 2, President Masoud Pezeshkian warned that evacuating Tehran residents might become necessary if rain does not fall before year\u2019s end, though the government clarified this was a warning to raise awareness, not a planned action. Other regional countries, including the UAE, also use cloud seeding to combat water scarcity.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 07:02 AM\nSource:[https://www.tuniscope.com](https://www.tuniscope.com/ar/article/417632/arabe/international/iran-050008)\n\n**Iran's capital faces unprecedented water shortages and even possible evacuation. What changes could help?**\nIran is experiencing its most severe water crisis in over 60 years, driven primarily by poor water management, agricultural expansion, and an extensive dam-building campaign. In Tehran, reservoirs are at less than 5% capacity, and in Mashhad, they are at just 3%. Authorities have begun implementing nighttime water cuts in Tehran, and President Masoud Pezeshkian has warned of potential evacuation if rainfall does not occur soon. Protests have erupted in Khuzestan and Isfahan due to water shortages, with the Zayandeh-Rud River drying up. In Shiraz, Isfahan, and Yazd, infrastructure is deteriorating due to soil instability from excessive groundwater extraction. Over 90% of Iran\u2019s water is used for agriculture, much of it lost to inefficient irrigation. The country\u2019s dam projects have disrupted ecosystems and contributed to the near-total desiccation of Lake Urmia, once the Middle East\u2019s largest salt lake, now a source of dangerous dust and salt storms. While climate change has worsened droughts, the crisis is largely man-made. The government\u2019s focus on large-scale infrastructure and energy self-sufficiency has undermined sustainability. Unregulated groundwater extraction\u2014especially through around one million wells, half of which are illegal\u2014has severely depleted aquifers. International sanctions have restricted Iran\u2019s access to advanced technologies, including precision agriculture tools, AI-powered monitoring platforms, smart sensors, satellite data (e.g., InSAR), and modern irrigation systems, which could help mitigate the crisis. Without systemic reform and technological investment, the water shortage could lead to mass displacement and irreversible environmental damage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 06:34 AM\nSource:[Down to Earth](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/water/irans-capital-faces-unprecedented-water-shortages-and-even-possible-evacuation-what-changes-could-help)\n\n**Iran's Real War May Be At Home, President Pezeshkian Warns Tehran May Need To Be Evacuated**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian warned on November 6, 2025, that Tehran\u2014home to approximately 10 million people\u2014may need to be evacuated if the ongoing water crisis worsens, as the capital\u2019s reservoirs are projected to run out of drinkable water in just nine days at current usage rates.

Nationally, 19 major dams\u2014around 10% of Iran\u2019s total\u2014have effectively run dry, and water reserves in Mashhad, a city of 4 million, have fallen below 3%. The crisis, exacerbated by five years of severe drought, is attributed by Pezeshkian to 'policies of past governments, climate change, and over-consumption,' while critics highlight decades of mismanagement, including overbuilding dams, illegal wells, and inefficient irrigation that consumes 80\u201390% of the country\u2019s water. In July, the president warned against water waste, as 70% of Tehran residents were reported to use more than the standard 130 liters per day. Although no major protests have occurred yet, officials acknowledge rising political risk, recalling violent demonstrations in Khuzestan in 2021 and rural unrest in 2018 over water mismanagement. The economy, already strained by U.S. sanctions and recent strikes on nuclear facilities, adds to public frustration.

In response, the Iranian government has launched cloud seeding operations\u2014artificially inducing rainfall by dispersing salt particles from aircraft into clouds to promote condensation and precipitation. A cloud seeding flight was conducted over Lake Urmia in the northwest on Saturday, according to the state news agency Irna. This method, used in countries including the USA, China, India, and Germany (for hail prevention), is considered environmentally low-risk due to minimal chemical concentrations, though concerns remain about potential long-term accumulation in sensitive ecosystems. Despite anecdotal claims linking cloud seeding to extreme rainfall in Dubai after April 2024 floods, no scientific evidence confirms this.

With a population of approximately 9.1 million, Tehran heavily relies on hydropower, but declining river and wetland levels have caused a sharp drop in electricity output, forcing some power plants to shut down due to lack of cooling water. Officials have labeled the current water shortage as 'unprecedented.' Iran\u2019s energy system remains highly dependent on hydropower and fossil fuels, and experts note that the growing interdependence between water supply and power production is becoming increasingly evident. Media analyses attribute the crisis to global climate change, which has led to frequent extreme heatwaves in Iran, combined with over-extraction of groundwater and poor water management. On October 2, 2025, Pezeshkian stated that due to excessive urban expansion, worsening water shortages, and increasing risks of land subsidence, Iran may have no choice but to relocate its capital from Tehran to southern Iran.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 05:23 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8o6zKd55xJa)\n\n**Situation 'Extremely Critical'!

He argues that water scarcity and overpopulation make current urban growth unsustainable and that relocating to Hormozgan Province\u2014on the Persian Gulf\u2014would provide direct sea access, economic potential, and reduced reliance on internal water transfers. Tehran, Karaj, and Qazvin are experiencing prolonged drought, with annual precipitation dropping to 140 millimeters last year\u2014well below the historical average of 260 millimeters\u2014and projections suggest levels could fall below 100 millimeters. Water reservoirs, which previously supplied nearly 70% of urban needs, have drastically declined, forcing reliance on overexploited aquifers and causing land subsidence of up to 30 centimeters per year in metropolitan areas. Summer water cuts became frequent, and state media even speculated about the approach of 'Day Zero'\u2014a scenario of complete water exhaustion. Ecological consequences include the drying of Golestan marshes, loss of bird habitats (including flamingos and pelicans), and threats to regional food security. Experts highlight that traditional water systems like qanats were neglected, while successive governments invested in large-scale infrastructure without rigorous environmental assessments. Official data indicate water distribution losses from leaks reach nearly one-third of supply, questioning the efficiency of recent projects. Pezeshkian\u2019s proposal remains a political 'trial balloon'\u2014lacking specific timelines or detailed plans\u2014but aims to force a national debate that previously stalled under past administrations, including that of Hassan Rouhani. Analysts warn Iran cannot delay action as the water crisis is already profoundly impacting lives and economies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 01:39 AM\nSource:[Radio Mitre \u270b\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\uddfc\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffd](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/mundo/iran-evalua-cambiar-su-capital-por-la-crisis-de-agua-que-sufre-teheran/)\n\n**Iran's President Proposes New Capital in Makr\u00e1n Amid Environmental Crisis**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has proposed relocating the capital from Tehran to a remote coastal region in Makr\u00e1n, on the Gulf of Oman, citing severe environmental degradation, water scarcity, and unsustainable urban growth as reasons. He argues that the city has exceeded its environmental limits, with depleted groundwater reserves and ongoing water transfers from other regions, calling the move 'not an option, but an obligation.' However, experts, including Ali Beitollahi from the Center for Road, Housing, and Urban Development Research, have dismissed the plan as impractical, noting Iran's economic crisis due to U.S. sanctions and war, lack of resources for such a massive project, and the misconception that relocating the capital would significantly reduce population pressure. They emphasize that only about 10% of the population might relocate for work, while others would replace them in Tehran. The city faces serious challenges, including land subsidence from drought, seismic risks, and overcrowded cemeteries. While other nations like Indonesia have attempted similar relocations (e.g., to Nusantara), these projects have faced major delays and costs. Experts argue that the focus should instead be on equitable distribution of jobs, healthcare, and education across Iran to reduce migration to Tehran. The proposal has not gained public traction, seen as a superficial response to long-standing mismanagement. According to a municipal official, addressing root causes\u2014such as unequal access to services\u2014would naturally reduce urban migration.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 03:09 PM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/economia/financial-times/2025/10/30/69037eec468aebaa498b4585.html)\n\n**Iran's president floats plan to build new capital city**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has proposed relocating the capital from Tehran to the remote southern coastal region of Makran along the Gulf of Oman, citing environmental degradation, groundwater depletion, land subsidence, seismic risks, and overcrowding as urgent reasons. Tehran, home to 10 million people, faces severe challenges including water shortages, sinking ground, earthquake vulnerability, and limited cemetery space. Pezeshkian argues that moving the capital is no longer optional but a 'mandate' for sustainable development. However, experts, including Ali Beitollahi from the Roads, Housing and Urban Development Research Centre, dismiss the plan as impractical, noting Iran lacks the financial capacity and infrastructure to undertake such a massive project. They argue that relocating the capital would not solve core problems like water scarcity, earthquakes, or air pollution, and may even reduce national attention on Tehran. Critics, including university student Mahla, view the proposal as a costly distraction from addressing systemic neglect. Instead, experts advocate for decentralizing economic and social opportunities\u2014such as education, healthcare, and jobs\u2014across Iran to reduce migration pressure on Tehran. The government is pursuing alternative measures, including a new metro station with Christian artwork, 100km of pedestrian and cycling trails, and a water transfer project from Taleghan Dam. However, international sanctions hinder scientific collaboration and technological advancement needed to address Tehran\u2019s crises. While countries like Indonesia have relocated capitals (e.g., Jakarta to Nusantara), such projects face enormous costs and delays. The Makran relocation plan remains in early feasibility stages and lacks public or expert consensus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/74854fde-908a-44da-a21c-81c840432414)\n\n**Due to Water Scarcity, Iran Will Have to Abandon Its Capital**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian announced that the country faces a water crisis so severe that relocating the capital from Tehran has shifted from a possible alternative to an unavoidable decision. He warned that the ongoing drought over the past five years has drastically reduced water levels in reservoirs and rivers, putting Tehran's stability at risk. According to official data, Tehran\u2014home to about 10 million people\u2014could run out of water within weeks if consumption is not reduced. Key reservoirs are at critically low levels: Amir Kabir reservoir operates at just 6% capacity, and 19 major dams across the country function below 20% capacity. Meteorological records show rainfall has dropped by up to 40% in recent months and between 50% and 60% in the previous year compared to historical averages. The crisis is exacerbated by intensive water use, with agriculture consuming nearly 80% of available water due to long-standing food self-sufficiency policies. In Tehran, about 70% of residents exceed the recommended daily water consumption of 130 liters. Over-extraction of groundwater has also caused land subsidence in parts of Tehran, with annual sinking rates reaching up to 30 centimeters. As a response, Pezeshkian proposed relocating the capital to the Persian Gulf region, specifically highlighting Hormozgan Province and the Makran coastal area for their access to open water and potential to boost foreign trade. Transporting water to Tehran from other regions would cost up to 4 euros per cubic meter, making it economically unviable to maintain the city as the administrative capital. While previous governments had considered relocation due to urban congestion or seismic risk, Pezeshkian is the first to declare it inevitable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 05:07 PM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/mundo/2025/10/2/por-escasez-de-agua-este-pais-tendra-que-abandonar-su-capital-560128.html)\n\n**Iran\u2019s President Urges Relocation of Capital from Tehran, Citing Strategic Necessity**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian called on Thursday, October 3, 2025, for accelerated steps to relocate the capital from Tehran, citing it as a strategic necessity rather than an administrative proposal. He emphasized that Tehran, home to approximately 15 million people, faces escalating crises including severe housing shortages, rising living costs, water scarcity, land subsidence, and extreme environmental pollution. According to Pezeshkian, these challenges have become unavoidable and demand urgent national action. The government is reportedly considering relocating the administrative center to a coastal city in southern or southeastern Iran, with provinces such as Sistan and Baluchestan and Hormozgan considered the most likely candidates due to their Gulf coastline and available urban planning space. Tehran has served as Iran\u2019s capital for over 200 years, but rapid population growth has outpaced infrastructure development, leading to worsening traffic congestion, deteriorating air quality, and increased internal migration. Previous governments discussed the idea without implementation due to high political and financial costs, but Pezeshkian\u2019s administration appears to be reviving the project as a key component of administrative reform and regional development.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 03:10 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0648](https://www.vetogate.com/5504748)\n\n**Iran's President: No Choice but to Relocate the Capital**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated on October 2, 2024, during a visit to Hormozgan Province on the Persian Gulf, that Iran has no choice but to relocate its capital from Tehran due to severe urban overexpansion, worsening water shortages, and increasing ground subsidence. Tehran, the capital for over 200 years, is home to 16 million people\u2014nearly one-fifth of Iran\u2019s population\u2014and serves as the nation\u2019s political, economic, and cultural hub. The city\u2019s rapid growth has placed immense strain on infrastructure and the environment. Although the idea of relocating the capital has been discussed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, it was previously shelved due to significant financial and logistical challenges. Since Pezeshkian took office in July 2023, the government has repeatedly revived the proposal, citing traffic congestion, water scarcity, poor resource management, severe air pollution, and land subsidence. In January 2024, government spokesperson Fatima Mohajerani confirmed that authorities were seriously considering the Makran region. By February 18, 2024, Iran was reportedly evaluating an extreme option: relocating the capital to a completely new site along the Oman Sea. On July 24, 2024, Pezeshkian stated that Iran might relocate, potentially requiring the forced evacuation of 15 million residents from Tehran. According to Iran International TV, while past presidents had suggested similar ideas, Pezeshkian is the first to frame relocation as an 'inevitable choice.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 07:40 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_1893892941_70e2834d02001udc2.html?from=society)\n\n**Iran\u2019s President Calls for Capital Relocation Amid Severe Water Crisis**\nIran's President Masoud Pezeshkian stated on October 2, 2025, that Tehran can no longer serve as the country's capital due to an escalating water crisis, citing a 50-60% reduction in annual rainfall\u2014140 mm compared to a 260 mm norm. He confirmed that the idea of relocating the capital to the southern coastal Makran region has already been discussed with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, making it 'not a matter of choice but an obligation.' Key reservoirs, including Amir Kabir (6% capacity), Lar, and Latyan, are at historically low levels, with 19 major dams operating below 20% of capacity. Ground subsidence in parts of Tehran reaches up to 30 cm per year due to groundwater depletion. The cost of transporting water to Tehran may reach \u20ac4 per cubic meter (approximately $4.65), highlighting the city's unsustainable resource burden. The proposal, first raised in January 2025, is driven by Tehran\u2019s overpopulation, chronic water and electricity shortages, and inefficient agriculture, which consumes about 80% of Iran\u2019s water. Experts warn that without major reforms in water management and consumption, Iran faces worsening water scarcity, ecological collapse, and rising public discontent.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 09:18 PM\nSource:[rossaprimavera.ru](https://rossaprimavera.ru/news/35d1040d)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across a broad spectrum of expertise\u2014including crisis management, intelligence analysis, political science, international relations, and Middle Eastern studies\u2014experts consistently assess the probability that Iran will announce an evacuation of at least 100,000 inhabitants of Tehran County before January 1, 2026 as very low, though not entirely impossible. All experts highlight the unprecedented scale and severity of the current water crisis in Tehran, with reservoirs reported below 5% capacity, dire warnings from President Pezeshkian, and intensified crisis rhetoric. However, they universally emphasize significant barriers:\n\n- **Logistical and Technical Feasibility:** Nearly all analysts judge that evacuating 100,000+ people from a city of over 10 million within a few weeks is a Herculean, near-impossible task given strained infrastructure, lack of resources, and the scale involved. Government officials publicly call large-scale evacuation 'impossible.'\n- **Historical Precedent:** There is no known case of a modern megacity being evacuated at such scale for environmental reasons, especially outside of war or sudden natural catastrophe. Past precedents in Iran and globally favor rationing, adaptation, or administrative relocation over mass civilian evacuation.\n- **Political and Regime Stability Calculus:** Experts note a strong regime aversion to actions that would signal loss of control or risk public unrest. Mass evacuation could severely undermine regime legitimacy, increase instability, and expose internal fractures: regimes tend to delay or avoid such steps unless faced with absolutely unmanageable collapse.\n- **Government Response Patterns:** Despite escalatory public warnings, the Iranian regime continues to favor crisis mitigation (rationing, cloud seeding, water transfers, communications management) and refrains from issuing or planning a mass evacuation order. Official messaging often walks back extreme warnings after initial public alarm.\n- **Possible Triggers for Evacuation:** The only credible 'yes' scenario identified by experts is immediate, catastrophic infrastructural failure (total water/utility failure, disease outbreak, or collapse of public order) within the short remaining timeframe, forcing the government to act out of desperation. Even so, most believe partial or spontaneous migration is likelier than a formal, public government order.\n- **Forecast Window:** The extremely short time left until resolution further decreases the likelihood that all necessary events\u2014total failure, unrest, executive consensus, and logistics\u2014could align in time.\n\nExpert probability estimates cluster tightly between 3% and 8%. The modal outcome is continued crisis management, increased hardship, rationing, and perhaps limited, localized or voluntary population movements, but no mass government-ordered evacuation meeting the criteria. The consensus is that only a 'black swan' disaster would overturn immense structural, logistical, and political obstacles within the coming weeks.",
