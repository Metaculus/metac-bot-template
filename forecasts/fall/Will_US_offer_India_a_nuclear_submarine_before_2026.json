No credible reporting indicates the US and India are anywhere near such an agreement. India's submarine development is robustly indigenous or in partnership with Russia/France, and its strategic autonomy stance further constrains US enthusiasm for deep defense tech transfer.

There is no evidence in authoritative news reporting up to November 2025 of even exploratory talks between the US and India on a nuclear submarine deal, let alone advanced negotiations. The news flow makes clear India's focus remains indigenous construction and ongoing Russian partnership, and recent reporting on US-AUKUS (and now South Korea) deals highlight both the complexity and slowness of such agreements even where they occur. The US' willingness to make such a deal with India\u2014non-ally, strategic partner, historically nonaligned, still using Russian arms, with its own indigenous program\u2014remains minimal over the remaining 1.5 months.

According to Reuters on November 11, 2025, the delay is primarily due to disagreements over the construction of nuclear-powered submarines. Analysts question whether the U.S. is willing to transfer sensitive technology. During the summit, President Yoon requested that the U.S. provide nuclear fuel for South Korea\u2019s nuclear-powered submarines to enhance naval capabilities. Trump did not respond directly at the time but on October 30 stated on social media that the U.S. would share nuclear propulsion technology to help South Korea build at least one nuclear-powered submarine. Officials from both sides initially said a factual summary outlining their security agreements\u2014including the nuclear submarine project\u2014would be released soon, along with the July trade deal, under which South Korea would invest billions in the U.S. in exchange for tariff reductions. However, South Korea\u2019s Defense Minister An Kwi-bok told KBS on November 9 that 'since the proposal to build nuclear-powered submarines, U.S. departments seem to need time to align their positions.' A senior presidential aide on November 7 revealed that the U.S. has approved South Korea\u2019s use of nuclear fuel for submarine construction, but the final draft of the factual summary remains delayed due to ongoing feedback and revisions from U.S. agencies. Reuters noted a discrepancy between the two nations\u2019 positions on the construction site: Yoon advocates building the submarines in South Korea, while Trump recently stated that the submarines are approved but will be built in U.S. shipyards. Analysts interpret this divergence as indicating uncertainty about the U.S. willingness to transfer sensitive technology. According to Yonhap News Agency, Minister An stated on November 5 during a parliamentary defense committee meeting that nuclear-powered submarines should be built domestically in South Korea, citing over 30 years of technical experience and deep research, and noting that the U.S. Philadelphia shipyard currently lacks sufficient technical capacity, human resources, and infrastructure.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 06:35 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u519b\u4e8b\u9891\u9053](https://military.china.com/important/64/20251112/48983284.html)\n\n**South Korea Pushes for New 'AUKUS-Style' Pact to Secure Nuclear Submarines**\nThe South Korean government is shifting its strategy toward securing nuclear-powered submarines (SSNs) by pursuing a separate agreement with the United States, distinct from the ongoing revision of the existing U.S.-South Korea Atomic Energy Agreement (also known as the '123 Agreement'). While the original agreement, based on U.S. Atomic Energy Act Section 123, restricts nuclear materials and technology to peaceful uses, the government believes a new, dedicated agreement\u2014modeled after the U.S.-UK-Australia 'AUKUS' pact\u2014would be more effective in gaining U.S. congressional approval. The AUKUS agreement, which enabled Australia to receive nuclear submarine technology, was the result of a three-year process involving U.S. legislative changes and congressional ratification. South Korea aims to replicate this approach by emphasizing regional security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, thereby justifying the transfer of nuclear submarine-related technology without altering the original agreement's peaceful-use framework. The current 123 Agreement allows South Korea to enrich uranium below 20% only with U.S. prior consent and prohibits reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The government is seeking to expand these rights through a revised agreement, similar to Japan\u2019s 'comprehensive approval' system. Meanwhile, South Korea has reportedly advanced its domestic nuclear submarine program, with the Ministry of National Defense confirming ongoing development of reactor systems, armament, and safety verification. If nuclear fuel is secured, South Korea aims to begin construction in the late 2020s and achieve the launch of its first SSN by the late 2030s. However, the timeline for actual negotiations and implementation remains uncertain, with estimates suggesting the process could take over three years, possibly delaying the start of construction until 2028 or later.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 05:41 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2a41](https://www.news1.kr/diplomacy/defense-diplomacy/5973384)\n\n**Nuclear Submarine Project Delayed: Doubts Over U.S. Willingness to Transfer Sensitive Technology**\nTwo weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung announced a consensus on tariffs and security issues during their summit, no written agreement has been released between the two countries.

Trump did not directly respond at the time but later stated on social media on October 30 that the U.S. would share nuclear propulsion technology to help South Korea build at least one nuclear-powered submarine. South Korea\u2019s Defense Minister An Kwi-bok told KBS on November 9 that U.S. departments are still coordinating their positions. A senior presidential official on November 7 revealed that while the U.S. has approved South Korea\u2019s use of nuclear fuel for submarines, final wording of the joint fact sheet remains unresolved due to ongoing feedback and revisions. Discrepancies exist over construction location: President Lee advocates building submarines in South Korea, while Trump recently stated they would be built in U.S. shipyards. Analysts interpret this divergence as indicating uncertainty about the U.S. willingness to transfer sensitive technology. South Korea\u2019s Defense Ministry, citing 30 years of technical development, insists the submarines should be built domestically, arguing the U.S. Philadelphia shipyard lacks sufficient technical capacity, human resources, and infrastructure. The broader context involves Trump\u2019s agenda to revive the U.S. shipbuilding industry, as China dominates 60% of the global commercial shipbuilding market, South Korea 22%, and the U.S. less than 1%. The partnership includes repairing U.S. warships, designing naval supply ships, and helping U.S. firms expand production, train workers, and improve efficiency. The Hanwha Ocean shipyard in Philadelphia is central to this effort, with a $5 billion investment plan to increase annual output from one to 20 commercial vessels and create thousands of jobs, with an internal goal of building 2\u20133 nuclear-powered submarines annually in the next decade. However, Hanwha has no prior experience building nuclear-powered submarines, and U.S. nuclear technology remains highly classified. Industry observers note the Trump administration\u2019s cautious approach toward allies, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of the partnership. South Korean scholars warn that the country\u2019s shipbuilding sector, having only recently recovered from a crisis, may be overburdened by the new responsibilities. Additionally, the draft trade agreement and its full content remain unpublished. A South Korean trade official said the tariff section is nearly finalized and will be released alongside the joint fact sheet. On November 11, Minister of Industry and Trade Kim Jung-won stated negotiations on the joint fact sheet are in the final stage but did not specify a release date. He also confirmed that a memorandum of understanding for $350 billion in South Korean investments in the U.S. is ready but not yet signed, with the signing method and timing still under discussion. Professor Jeong Han-beom of Korea National Defense University told the Korea Herald that the main obstacle in the U.S.-South Korea trade and security agreements lies in jurisdiction over review authority: the U.S. Department of Energy\u2014not the State Department or Defense Department\u2014controls approval of South Korea\u2019s use of enriched uranium for submarine fuel, and it evaluates the issue from its own policy perspective rather than from the standpoint of the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 12:02 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8oCiSFFqANP)\n\n**How South Korea is Pursuing Nuclear Submarines: Lessons from the AUKUS Agreement**\nSouth Korea has secured a U.S. commitment to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, but key issues such as fuel supply and construction location remain under discussion. The South Korean government is using Australia\u2019s AUKUS security pact with the U.S. and UK\u2014signed in 2021\u2014as a primary reference. Under the original 2015 U.S.-South Korea nuclear agreement, based on U.S. Atomic Energy Act Section 123, any uranium enrichment above 20% or post-use reprocessing requires prior U.S. approval and is limited to peaceful purposes. To overcome this, South Korea aims to secure comprehensive U.S. approval for nuclear fuel use and establish a separate agreement for military purposes\u2014mirroring the AUKUS model. In the AUKUS deal, the U.S. granted Australia nuclear submarine technology and construction support despite non-proliferation concerns, citing Indo-Pacific stability and countering China. The U.S. eventually signed a separate military-use agreement with Australia three years after the initial announcement, in August 2024. The South Korean government believes a similar approach\u2014negotiating a standalone military fuel agreement\u2014would be more feasible than revising the existing nuclear pact. However, the process faces delays due to internal U.S. agency disagreements over the 'U.S.-South Korea Tariff and Security Joint Fact Sheet.' The fact sheet\u2019s release has been postponed since the October 29 summit, with officials stressing it must be issued by the end of this week. South Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun-won is expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Niagara Falls, Canada, on November 12, 2025, to seek a breakthrough. The government insists that, given the two-week delay since the summit, the fact sheet must be released this week, with the meeting seen as a critical opportunity to resolve the impasse.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 10:10 PM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/diplomacy/1228716.html)\n\n**South Korea\u2019s Pursuit of Nuclear Submarines: A Strategic Shift Amid Escalating East Asian Tensions**\nOn October 29, 2024, during talks with South Korea\u2019s President Lee Chae-myung, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his support for building and operating nuclear-powered submarines (SSBNs) for South Korea, with the first vessel to be constructed at a Philadelphia shipyard. South Korea\u2019s Defense Minister An Gyu-bak confirmed the decision, stating the new submarines would have greater speed and range than current diesel-electric models, significantly enhancing deterrence against North Korea. Although North Korea has not officially commented, analysts predict a sharp reaction, including potential military countermeasures. Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Shigeru Koizumi stated on November 6 that Japan faces a 'severe security environment' and is considering transitioning to nuclear submarines. Experts, including Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, warn that the region is entering a new arms race, driven by North Korea\u2019s rapid military advancements\u2014including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and an expanding nuclear arsenal, possibly aided by Russia. China is also increasing its military capabilities, aiming to reassert dominance in East Asia, while the U.S. appears to be withdrawing from regional commitments. The situation is further complicated by North Korea\u2019s recent missile tests\u2014short-range ballistic missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles\u2014just before Trump\u2019s visit to Seoul for the APEC summit on November 1. Meanwhile, China commissioned its third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, on November 5, and intensified military exercises near Okinawa and the South China Sea. Taiwan is increasing defense spending, including plans to purchase 66 F-16V Block 70 fighters and AGM-154C bombs from the U.S. by 2027\u20132028. Japan is expanding its navy and air force, including new frigates, drones, and submarines, and plans to raise defense spending from 1% to 2% of GDP by April 2025. Japan also agreed to transfer P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and coastal radar systems to the Philippines to monitor Chinese vessels in disputed waters. Professor Dan Pinkston of Troy University in Alabama warned that South Korea\u2019s acquisition of nuclear submarines\u2014despite its 1975 adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\u2014could be a step toward developing its own nuclear weapons, especially given South Korea\u2019s ability to enrich uranium and operate nuclear reactors. He noted that Trump\u2019s unpredictable foreign policy makes future U.S. commitments uncertain, and that South Korea may pursue nuclear weapons if it perceives a security threat. 'If these submarines are equipped with conventional warheads, it\u2019s a small step toward developing nuclear warheads\u2014something South Korea sees as essential for its security,' Pinkston concluded.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 04:58 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/atomnye-podlodki-dla-uznoj-korei-oni-nuzny-seulu-ili-trampu/a-74699615)\n\n**U.S.-South Korea Nuclear Submarine Project Stalls Without Written Agreement**\nTwo weeks after U.S. President Trump and South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol announced a consensus on tariffs and security issues during their summit, no written agreement has been released between the two countries.

On November 4, 2025, the 57th U.S.-South Korea Security Consultative Meeting was held at the South Korean Ministry of Defense in Seoul, addressing the nuclear-powered submarine development plan, alliance modernization and deterrence strategy, wartime operational control, coordination mechanisms on the Korean Peninsula, defense funding, and defense industry cooperation. The meeting implemented topics from the U.S.-South Korea summit and may have lasting implications for regional security. South Korea emphasized that its nuclear submarine development is for self-defense, operates under nuclear non-proliferation treaty constraints, and uses nuclear propulsion without carrying nuclear weapons. Defense Minister An Gwi-bok stated that as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), South Korea cannot possess nuclear weapons and remains committed to denuclearization of the peninsula. U.S. Defense Secretary Hegseth affirmed active support for South Korea\u2019s nuclear submarine construction. Both sides agreed to base cooperation on a 'nuclear coordination group' model to integrate nuclear and conventional forces, exploring details on nuclear fuel technology, operational support, and training collaboration. South Korea\u2019s development and deployment of nuclear-powered submarines require recognition from international bodies like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmation that the program complies with the NPT, and amendments to the U.S.-South Korea Atomic Energy Agreement. On October 29, 2025, Trump publicly declared the U.S. would assist South Korea in gaining international recognition for the project. The joint development is a key component of U.S.-South Korea alliance modernization and strategic deterrence in the Asia-Pacific. The meeting reaffirmed the shared goal of countering North Korean provocations and enhancing the alliance\u2019s responsiveness in the region. Deploying nuclear submarines at southern Korean waters such as Jeju Island and Busan would strengthen the northernmost segment of the U.S.-led island chain aimed at containing China, complementing Australia\u2019s acquisition of nuclear submarines. This strategic framework began during the Biden administration.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 04:10 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20251112/48983977.html)\n\n**Nuclear Submarine Project Delayed: Doubts Over U.S. Willingness to Transfer Sensitive Technology**\nTwo weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung announced a consensus on tariffs and security issues during their summit, no written agreement has been released between the two countries.

The broader context involves Trump\u2019s agenda to revive the U.S. shipbuilding industry, as China dominates 60% of the global commercial shipbuilding market, South Korea 22%, and the U.S. less than 1%. The partnership includes repairing U.S. warships, designing naval supply ships, and helping U.S. firms expand production, train workers, and improve efficiency. The Hanwha Ocean shipyard in Philadelphia is central to this effort, with a $5 billion investment plan to increase annual output from one to 20 commercial vessels and create thousands of jobs, with an internal goal of building 2\u20133 nuclear-powered submarines annually in the next decade. However, Hanwha has no prior experience building nuclear-powered submarines, and U.S. nuclear technology remains highly classified. Industry observers note the Trump administration\u2019s cautious approach toward allies, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of the partnership. South Korean scholars warn that the country\u2019s shipbuilding sector, having only recently recovered from a crisis, may be overburdened by the new responsibilities. Additionally, the draft trade agreement and its full content remain unpublished. A South Korean trade official said the tariff section is nearly finalized and will be released alongside the joint fact sheet. On November 11, Minister of Industry and Trade Kim Jung-won stated negotiations on the joint fact sheet are in the final stage but did not specify a release date. He also confirmed that a memorandum of understanding for $350 billion in South Korean investments in the U.S. is ready but not yet signed, with the signing method and timing still under discussion. Professor Jeong Han-beom of Korea National Defense University told the Korea Herald that the main obstacle in the U.S.-South Korea trade and security agreements lies in jurisdiction over review authority: the U.S. Department of Energy\u2014not the State Department or Defense Department\u2014controls approval of South Korea\u2019s use of enriched uranium for submarine fuel, and it evaluates the issue from its own policy perspective rather than from the standpoint of the U.S.-South Korea alliance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 12:02 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8oCiSFFqANP)\n\n**How South Korea is Pursuing Nuclear Submarines: Lessons from the AUKUS Agreement**\nSouth Korea has secured a U.S. commitment to acquire nuclear-powered submarines, but key issues such as fuel supply and construction location remain under discussion. The South Korean government is using Australia\u2019s AUKUS security pact with the U.S. and UK\u2014signed in 2021\u2014as a primary reference. Under the original 2015 U.S.-South Korea nuclear agreement, based on U.S. Atomic Energy Act Section 123, any uranium enrichment above 20% or post-use reprocessing requires prior U.S. approval and is limited to peaceful purposes. To overcome this, South Korea aims to secure comprehensive U.S. approval for nuclear fuel use and establish a separate agreement for military purposes\u2014mirroring the AUKUS model. In the AUKUS deal, the U.S. granted Australia nuclear submarine technology and construction support despite non-proliferation concerns, citing Indo-Pacific stability and countering China. The U.S. eventually signed a separate military-use agreement with Australia three years after the initial announcement, in August 2024. The South Korean government believes a similar approach\u2014negotiating a standalone military fuel agreement\u2014would be more feasible than revising the existing nuclear pact. However, the process faces delays due to internal U.S. agency disagreements over the 'U.S.-South Korea Tariff and Security Joint Fact Sheet.' The fact sheet\u2019s release has been postponed since the October 29 summit, with officials stressing it must be issued by the end of this week. South Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Cho Hyun-won is expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the G7 Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Niagara Falls, Canada, on November 12, 2025, to seek a breakthrough. The government insists that, given the two-week delay since the summit, the fact sheet must be released this week, with the meeting seen as a critical opportunity to resolve the impasse.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 10:10 PM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/diplomacy/1228716.html)\n\n**Poland\u2019s Search for a New Submarine: The Orka Program and Global Contenders**\nPoland has renewed its commitment to the Orka program, aiming to build new submarines for its navy, with the partner selection expected to be finalized by the end of 2025. The program, originally launched in 1997 as OPNT and later renamed Orka, has faced repeated delays despite plans to procure three submarines by 2013. Poland\u2019s navy currently lacks operational submarines, relying on aging vessels such as two 45-year-old U.S. Oliver Hazard Perry frigates, one modernized corvette (Sl\u0105zak), and outdated missile boats. To compensate, Poland is developing a 'small but very capable' fleet, including three frigates under the Miecznik program, designed by British firm Babcock International based on the Type 31 design, with construction beginning in 2021 and delivery expected between 2029 and 2032. The program includes technology transfer to Polish shipbuilder PGZ and collaboration with international firms like Thales, MBDA, and OSI Maritime Systems. Poland has explored multiple international partners, including Germany (TKMS, with proven submarine projects like 212A), South Korea (Hanwha Ocean, offering KSS-III Batch II and a temporary 209-class submarine for training), France (Naval Group\u2019s Scorp\u00e8ne), Sweden (Saab Kockums\u2019 A26), Spain (Navantia\u2019s S-80), and Italy (Fincantieri\u2019s 212NFS). South Korea has offered a temporary submarine for 2027, full technology transfer, local maintenance partnerships, and a gift of a Pohang-class corvette. Germany remains a leading contender due to geographic proximity, experience, and existing cooperation. France and Spain face reputational risks due to past project delays and failures. Sweden\u2019s A26 program is also delayed. Poland requires submarines with air-independent propulsion (AIP), vertical launch systems for cruise missiles, and technology transfer. The NSM Block IA anti-ship missile, already in Polish service, can be adapted for submarines and has a range exceeding 300 km. The final decision is expected soon, with potential implications for NATO\u2019s Baltic naval posture.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 09:51 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/kakuyu-podvodnuyu-lodku-vyberet-polsha-731044.html)\n\n**South Korea's Path to Acquiring Nuclear-Powered Submarines: Challenges and Considerations**\nSouth Korea's potential acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines (SSN) is under increasing public discussion, especially following the recent South Korea-U.S. summit. Currently, about 130 nuclear-powered submarines are operated globally by the U.S. (66), Russia (31), China (12), the UK (10), France (9), and India (2). Nuclear-powered submarines are categorized into strategic ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), designed to store nuclear weapons for retaliatory strikes, and attack submarines (SSNs), which carry no nuclear weapons but are used for surveillance, pursuit, and destruction of enemy submarines and warships. The SSN type, like the ones the U.S. plans to supply to Australia under the AUKUS agreement, offers significant advantages: twice the speed of diesel submarines and the ability to remain submerged for months, making them ideal for long-range naval operations. However, South Korea faces four major obstacles to acquiring such submarines. First, U.S. nuclear non-proliferation policy raises concerns, as submarine reactors are military facilities not subject to IAEA inspections or monitoring. Second, U.S. military technology protection policies restrict sharing of advanced nuclear propulsion technology, which uses weapons-grade uranium (over 90%) and operates differently from civilian reactors. Third, South Korea must define a clear operational purpose\u2014deploying such expensive assets in distant waters like the South China Sea could provoke conflict with China, while using them only for monitoring North Korea\u2019s 70+ submarines would be inefficient. A more cost-effective alternative might be deploying advanced AIP diesel submarines and underwater sensor networks. Fourth, long-term U.S. political stability and alliance cohesion are essential, as future U.S. administrations may not support the project, and sustained U.S. maintenance and support post-construction are critical. The article concludes that strong South Korea-U.S. alliance trust is a prerequisite for any progress on this project.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 08:25 PM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/opinion/chosun_column/2025/11/11/UK7BLPTC7JDDRH5QYOCXFZ7MXQ/)\n\n**South Korea\u2019s Pursuit of Nuclear Submarines: A Strategic Shift Amid Escalating East Asian Tensions**\nOn October 29, 2024, during talks with South Korea\u2019s President Lee Chae-myung, U.S. President Donald Trump announced his support for building and operating nuclear-powered submarines (SSBNs) for South Korea, with the first vessel to be constructed at a Philadelphia shipyard. South Korea\u2019s Defense Minister An Gyu-bak confirmed the decision, stating the new submarines would have greater speed and range than current diesel-electric models, significantly enhancing deterrence against North Korea. Although North Korea has not officially commented, analysts predict a sharp reaction, including potential military countermeasures. Japan\u2019s Defense Minister Shigeru Koizumi stated on November 6 that Japan faces a 'severe security environment' and is considering transitioning to nuclear submarines. Experts, including Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University, warn that the region is entering a new arms race, driven by North Korea\u2019s rapid military advancements\u2014including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and an expanding nuclear arsenal, possibly aided by Russia. China is also increasing its military capabilities, aiming to reassert dominance in East Asia, while the U.S. appears to be withdrawing from regional commitments. The situation is further complicated by North Korea\u2019s recent missile tests\u2014short-range ballistic missiles and sea-launched cruise missiles\u2014just before Trump\u2019s visit to Seoul for the APEC summit on November 1. Meanwhile, China commissioned its third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, on November 5, and intensified military exercises near Okinawa and the South China Sea. Taiwan is increasing defense spending, including plans to purchase 66 F-16V Block 70 fighters and AGM-154C bombs from the U.S. by 2027\u20132028. Japan is expanding its navy and air force, including new frigates, drones, and submarines, and plans to raise defense spending from 1% to 2% of GDP by April 2025. Japan also agreed to transfer P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and coastal radar systems to the Philippines to monitor Chinese vessels in disputed waters. Professor Dan Pinkston of Troy University in Alabama warned that South Korea\u2019s acquisition of nuclear submarines\u2014despite its 1975 adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)\u2014could be a step toward developing its own nuclear weapons, especially given South Korea\u2019s ability to enrich uranium and operate nuclear reactors. He noted that Trump\u2019s unpredictable foreign policy makes future U.S. commitments uncertain, and that South Korea may pursue nuclear weapons if it perceives a security threat. 'If these submarines are equipped with conventional warheads, it\u2019s a small step toward developing nuclear warheads\u2014something South Korea sees as essential for its security,' Pinkston concluded.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 04:58 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/ru/atomnye-podlodki-dla-uznoj-korei-oni-nuzny-seulu-ili-trampu/a-74699615)\n\n**The Indian Navy Is Building And Fielding A New Ship Every 40 Days**\nThe Indian Navy is commissioning a new domestically built warship or submarine every 40 days, according to Admiral Dinesh K. Tripathi, Chief of Naval Staff, at the India Defence Conclave. This rapid pace of shipbuilding is part of a broader modernization effort driven by the Make In India and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives, aiming for over 200 warships and submarines by 2035. With 52 platforms currently under construction in Indian shipyards\u2014including stealth frigates, destroyers, corvettes, and submarines\u2014the Navy is shifting from a reliance on imported vessels to self-reliance in defense manufacturing. The fleet\u2019s modernization includes the INS Vikrant, India\u2019s first domestically produced aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2022, and the deployment of advanced systems such as the BrahMos cruise missile and next-generation P-15B Visakhapatnam-class destroyers. The Navy is also developing a nuclear-powered carrier and expanding its submarine fleet with six nuclear-powered attack submarines to complement two nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines. This transformation enhances India\u2019s ability to project power across the Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific, ensuring sea-lane security for 95% of its trade by volume and countering growing Chinese and Pakistani naval presence. The strategic shift reflects India\u2019s ambition to become a sovereign maritime power with sustained regional influence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 01:57 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vikrammittal/2025/11/11/the-indian-navy-is-building-and-fielding-a-new-ship-every-40-days/)\n\n**Pakistan to Receive Its First Chinese-Made Submarine in 2026 to Counter India\u2019s Naval Dominance in the Indian Ocean**\nThe Chief of the Pakistan Navy, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, announced that the first submarine of the Hangor class, built in China, will enter service in 2026, marking a strategic shift in the naval balance of the Indian Ocean. The $5 billion (4.356 billion euros) deal includes the delivery of eight submarines by 2028, with the first four constructed in China and the remaining four assembled locally in Karachi\u2019s shipyards. This technology transfer aims to counter India\u2019s regional naval dominance and enhance Pakistan\u2019s deterrence capabilities. The Hangor-class submarines, derived from China\u2019s export model S26, feature advanced stealth, long-range autonomy, and can carry up to six 533 mm torpedo launchers and cruise missiles, including the Babur-3, enabling precision land-attack capabilities. With a 76-meter hull and a submersion displacement of nearly 2,800 tons, these submarines are designed for maritime denial, offensive operations, and surveillance of critical energy routes in the northern Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. The program, described by Ashraf as 'advancing without problems,' strengthens Pakistan\u2019s maritime patrol and surveillance capacity amid rising regional tensions. The strategic alliance between China and Pakistan extends beyond naval cooperation, forming part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which links China\u2019s Xinjiang region to Gwadar Port in the Arabian Sea, reducing China\u2019s reliance on the Strait of Malacca. According to SIPRI, Pakistan absorbed over 60% of China\u2019s defense exports between 2020 and 2024. Ashraf emphasized that the partnership reflects a shared strategic vision, mutual trust, and long-term collaboration, with future plans including greater interoperability, joint research, technology exchange, and industrial cooperation. The introduction of these submarines challenges India\u2019s naval supremacy and reconfigures the geopolitical dynamics of South Asia.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 01:24 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/observatorio-defensa/20251111/pakistan-recibira-primer-submarino-origen-chino-contrarrestar-hegemonia-india-indico/1003744000311_0.html)\n\n**Challenge to India's naval dominance as Pakistan to get Hangor-class submarines**\nPakistan's Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, confirmed that the first batch of Chinese-built Hangor-class submarines\u2014co-developed by China and Pakistan\u2014will enter service next year, marking a major technological milestone for Beijing and a challenge to India's naval dominance in the Indian Ocean. The conventionally powered attack submarines, based on China's Type 039A design with air-independent propulsion, can remain submerged for up to three weeks and have a total mission time of around 60 days. They are equipped with torpedo tubes capable of launching anti-ship and submarine-launched cruise missiles, potentially enabling Pakistan to develop a second-strike nuclear capability. The submarines are part of an $5 billion contract signed in 2015, under which Pakistan will receive eight vessels\u2014four built in China and four produced locally under technology transfer. The program has overcome earlier delays caused by Germany\u2019s refusal to export MTU396 engines due to an EU arms embargo, prompting China to develop the CHD620 engine, which analysts believe has largely resolved supply-chain constraints. However, experts caution that the CHD620 engine\u2019s operational performance, especially in noise and stealth, remains unproven. Analysts including Liselotte Odgaard of the Hudson Institute and Jagannath Panda of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute note that the Hangor-class submarines will enhance Pakistan\u2019s anti-access and area-denial capabilities, thicken its sea-denial posture in the northern Arabian Sea, complicate Indian anti-submarine operations, and support China\u2019s broader Indo-Pacific ambitions, including maritime corridors to the Middle East via Gwadar port. Pakistan already operates five conventional submarines from France and has received four Type 054 frigates (renamed Tughril-class) from China. Pakistan is the world\u2019s largest importer of Chinese weapons, accounting for 63% of Beijing\u2019s global arms exports from 2020 to 2024.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 07:19 PM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2576658/pakistan-to-get-chinese-hangor-class-submarines-in-2026)\n\n**South Korea's nuclear submarines & regional tensions**\nSouth Korea's acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, approved by U.S. President Donald Trump on October 30, 2024, has intensified regional security concerns and sparked debate in Japan about pursuing similar capabilities. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung cited limited underwater endurance of current diesel-powered submarines as justification, prompting the U.S. to support the development of nuclear-powered vessels. This move has drawn criticism from Russia, China, and North Korea, with experts warning of potential regional instability and an arms race. Dr. Andrew Yeo of the Brookings Institution cautioned that South Korea\u2019s pursuit of nuclear propulsion could create a permissive environment for future nuclear weapons development, despite its adherence to non-proliferation commitments. South Korea aims to build the submarine domestically within a decade, potentially becoming the eighth nation with such technology\u2014after the U.S., Russia, China, France, Britain, India, and Australia (under AUKUS). North Korea, meanwhile, is reportedly advancing its own nuclear-powered submarine program, possibly with Russian assistance, and has threatened aggressive actions against the U.S. and South Korea. Japan, constrained by its Three Non-Nuclear Principles and historical trauma from atomic bombings, remains divided, though Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi acknowledged the need to consider nuclear-powered submarines due to the worsening regional security environment. Japan\u2019s Defense Ministry expert panel had recommended such submarines for the first time in September 2024. The U.S. decision is linked to a broader $350 billion South Korean investment deal, with $150 billion allocated to revive the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The submarine is planned for construction at Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Pennsylvania, acquired by South Korea\u2019s Hanwha Ocean for $100 million in 2024, with additional $5 billion pledged in August. However, Seoul is negotiating to build the vessel domestically due to the shipyard\u2019s lack of necessary infrastructure and expertise. China has sanctioned five Hanwha subsidiaries on October 14, accusing them of aiding U.S. efforts against Chinese maritime sectors, signaling potential strain in Sino-Korean relations. Analysts like Dr. Bence Nemeth of King\u2019s College London view the arrangement as a strategic win for both Washington and Seoul, enhancing U.S. shipbuilding capacity and fulfilling South Korea\u2019s long-standing defense ambitions. Professor Heng Yee Kuang of the University of Tokyo suggests that if Japan follows suit, it could help maintain a balanced undersea power dynamic in the region.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 01:25 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/as-us-allows-south-korea-to-join-nuclear-sub-club-how-will-this-impact-japan-and-the-region)\n\n**South Korea\u2019s Pursuit of Nuclear Submarines: Balancing Deterrence and Non-Proliferation**\nSouth Korea's potential acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, supported by the United States, could significantly alter the security environment in East Asia and influence Japan's ongoing debate over nuclear submarine possession. U.S. President Trump announced on his social media in late October 2024 that he had approved South Korea's construction of nuclear-powered submarines\u2014equipped with conventional weapons\u2014at a shipyard in Philadelphia, U.S. This marks a policy shift, as previous U.S. administrations had opposed such a move. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol had requested U.S. support during a bilateral summit, arguing that current diesel-powered submarines lack sufficient endurance and mobility to track North Korean and Chinese submarines effectively. Currently, only six countries\u2014U.S., UK, France, Russia, China, and India\u2014operate nuclear-powered submarines. China operates a dozen or more, deploying them routinely near Japan and in the South China Sea. North Korea is pursuing development of a nuclear-powered submarine capable of launching ballistic missiles. The U.S.-UK-Australia trilateral agreement to support Australia\u2019s acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines is also seen as a strategic move to counter China. South Korea now seeks U.S. supply of nuclear fuel, but the existing U.S.-South Korea Atomic Energy Agreement prohibits military use of supplied fuel, requiring a treaty revision. To prevent nuclear proliferation concerns, transparency in U.S.-South Korea negotiations is essential. In Japan, the Defense Ministry\u2019s advisory panel recommended in September 2024 the introduction of next-generation propulsion submarines as part of defense enhancement, and Defense Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi stated at a press conference that 'all options' should be considered to strengthen deterrence. However, Japan\u2019s Atomic Energy Basic Law restricts nuclear use to peaceful purposes, making current legal frameworks a significant barrier. Japan is the only non-nuclear-weapon state with the right to reprocess spent fuel and recover plutonium, and it publicly reports its stockpile status. Japan should engage in dialogue with the U.S. and South Korea to balance nuclear non-proliferation commitments with the need to strengthen deterrence.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 09:23 PM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/editorial/20251105-OYT1T50256/)\n\n**US-South Korea nuke sub pact deeper than it seems - Asia Times**\nOn November 6, 2025, the Asia Times reported that the U.S.-South Korea agreement to transfer nuclear submarine propulsion technology\u2014announced by President Donald Trump in Busan\u2014marks a strategic shift in Indo-Pacific security. For the first time, South Korea will join an elite group of nations capable of operating nuclear-powered submarines, alongside the U.S., UK, France, China, India, and Australia under AUKUS. While Washington emphasizes the transfer involves propulsion only, not nuclear weapons, the strategic implications are profound: nuclear-powered submarines offer extended submerged endurance, stealth, and deep-water patrol capabilities, significantly enhancing South Korea\u2019s deterrence, especially given its ongoing state of war with North Korea. The move reflects a broader U.S. strategy to decentralize regional security by building a network of semi-autonomous, well-armed allies to counter China\u2019s naval expansion. This shift pressures Japan, whose conventional submarine fleet lacks nuclear propulsion, to reconsider its posture, despite constitutional constraints. Beijing is expected to respond by accelerating undersea modernization and anti-submarine warfare capabilities in the East and South China Seas, while Pyongyang may justify further missile and submarine tests. The deal also signals a strategic evolution from U.S. containment to a coalition-based model akin to NATO\u2019s burden-sharing, fostering deeper industrial collaboration between South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. in shipbuilding, sensors, and reactor technology. The article concludes that this development signifies a move toward a more distributed power structure in the Indo-Pacific, where regional middle powers like Japan and South Korea must actively shape the new strategic order rather than passively adapt.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 06, 2025 08:58 AM\nSource:[Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2025/11/us-south-korea-nuke-sub-pact-deeper-than-it-seems/)\n\n**The Hypocrisy of Nuclear Submarines vs. Civilian Nuclear Power: A Contradiction in South Korea's Energy Policy**\nAt the 2025 APEC summit, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung announced plans to develop nuclear-powered submarines, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to publicly approve the U.S. supplying nuclear fuel via social media. This move marks a significant shift, as South Korea has long pursued nuclear submarine development since the 1993 North Korean nuclear crisis, with early efforts including the acquisition of design blueprints from Russia and the development of the SMART reactor by 2012. The 'Project 362' initiative under the 2003 government aimed to build three nuclear-powered attack submarines by 2017 but was halted due to diplomatic tensions and U.S. refusal to supply fuel based on non-proliferation principles. The article argues that nuclear-powered submarines are fundamentally different from nuclear weapons\u2014they provide propulsion via small reactors without weaponization. Historically, nuclear submarines predate commercial nuclear power plants, with the U.S. launching the USS Nautilus in 1954. Today, countries including the U.S., UK, France, China, India, and Australia possess such vessels. However, challenges remain: South Korea may need to revise its U.S. nuclear agreement, face opposition from China and North Korea, and secure stable nuclear fuel supplies\u2014especially high-enriched uranium. Domestic opposition is also strong, particularly given the new Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment's push for 'Phase 2 of the anti-nuclear policy.' The article criticizes the contradiction in allowing nuclear technology for military use while rejecting it for civilian and industrial energy, calling it illogical and lacking persuasive power. The author, Professor Lee Deok-hwan of Sogang University, highlights this inconsistency as a central flaw in national policy.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 03:06 AM\nSource:[\uc544\uc2dc\uc544\uacbd\uc81c](https://www.asiae.co.kr/article/2025110307544501069)\n\n**Korean Defense Industry Gains Momentum: Nuclear Submarine Deal with U.S. Signals Global Breakthrough**\nSouth Korea has secured the right to construct nuclear-powered submarines through a surprise agreement with the United States, marking a major milestone for national defense and strategic autonomy. U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed the approval on October 30, 2025, stating the submarines will be built at the Philadelphia shipyard, with details to be finalized in follow-up negotiations. This agreement, which signals U.S. recognition of South Korea's advanced defense technology, is expected to significantly boost the global standing of K-Defense (K-\ubc29\uc0b0). Currently, only five official nuclear-armed states\u2014U.S., Russia, China, UK, and France\u2014and India possess nuclear-powered submarines; Australia and Brazil are pursuing acquisition through foreign purchase. South Korea already has world-class capabilities in conventional submarine construction and has nearly mastered key technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs) for nuclear propulsion. President Lee Jae-myung's request to the U.S. for only nuclear fuel supply\u2014excluding other aspects\u2014reflects strong technical confidence. The deal also marks a strategic shift, as the U.S., facing reduced naval capacity, is turning to South Korea as a partner, effectively breaking the previous non-proliferation cartel. According to Korean Institute for Defense Analysis (KIDA) Director Woo Ji-hoon, the agreement has generated positive ripple effects, with countries like Canada and Poland\u2014currently evaluating submarine procurement worth 60 trillion and 8 trillion KRW respectively\u2014now viewing South Korea more favorably. South Korea is competing with established powers like Germany and France in these bids. While K-Defense has already achieved strong market presence in land-based systems like the K2 Black Panther tank and K9 Thunder howitzer, this breakthrough could elevate it into high-value underwater and surface combat systems. The agreement also reverses the U.S. precedent set in 2023 when it sold nuclear-powered submarines to Australia under a one-off exception. Notably, the AUKUS submarine agreement is now under strain due to U.S. domestic submarine demand constraints, creating new opportunities for South Korea. Sejong Institute senior researcher Jung Sung-jang and researcher Peter Ward urged in a June report that South Korea should be considered for AUKUS cooperation to help sustain U.S. attack submarine capacity.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 08:55 PM\nSource:[\ub178\ucef7\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.nocutnews.co.kr/news/6421325)\n\n**UK and India Finalize $470 Million Missile Deal Amid Expanding Defense Cooperation**\nThe United Kingdom and India signed a \u00a3350 million (approximately $470 million USD) contract on October 9, 2025, under which the UK will supply India's army with Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMM) and launchers, identical to those provided to Ukraine. The missiles and launchers will be delivered by Thales Air Defence Systems, headquartered and manufactured in Northern Ireland, primarily for air defense purposes. The UK previously announced in March 2025 that it would supply over 5,000 LMMs to Ukraine. The UK Ministry of Defence stated that this contract advances broader defense system cooperation between the two nations. Additionally, UK-India collaboration on developing a shipboard full-electric propulsion system for amphibious assault transport ships is now in a new phase, with detailed implementation plans completed. This system will be used in India\u2019s newly constructed fleet of amphibious ships. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding in November 2024 to jointly design, develop, and produce the propulsion system, supporting India\u2019s advancement in indigenous naval technology. Propulsion systems for military aircraft and ships are among the UK\u2019s priority defense technology cooperation projects with India. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer led a delegation of over 120 British business, cultural, sports, and education representatives on a two-day visit to Mumbai on October 7, 2025, to finalize a series of agreements, including defense cooperation. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s flagship aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales led a carrier strike group currently docked in India. The group recently completed joint maritime and air exercises in the Indian Ocean with Indian forces and conducted the first-ever dual-carrier exercise with the Indian carrier strike group. The UK-led strike group includes Japan\u2019s JS Akebono destroyer and Norway\u2019s HNoMS Roald Amundsen anti-submarine frigate. On October 5, 2025, the UK and Indian navies began a four-day 'Konkan' exercise in the Indian Ocean, both deploying submarines. The HMS Prince of Wales strike group departed from England in late April 2025 for Indo-Pacific deployment and conducted exercises with India during its June 2025 visit, including joint anti-submarine warfare. Prior to arriving in India, the strike group participated in a two-week 'Five Power Defence Arrangements' (FPDA) exercise in Malaysian waters from September 2025 with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Malaysia, covering maritime, land, air, and cyber operations. The FPDA, signed in 1971 by the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Malaysia, remains the only multilateral defense agreement in Southeast Asia.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 06:23 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/9061851)\n\n**EXPLAINER: Growing military ties with Germany, a collaborator in Indias latest submarine project - The Tribune**\nThe Indian government has authorised formal negotiations to move forward with the joint acquisition of six submarines under Project\u201175 (India), a partnership between Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) and Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL). The project, valued at Rs 70,000\u202fcrore, follows TKMS\u2011MDL\u2019s successful clearance of the Navy\u2019s field trials, beating competitors such as Navantia\u2011Larsen & Toubro. Negotiations are slated to begin by month\u2011end and are expected to take 6\u20138\u202fmonths, after which a contract will be signed once final government approval is obtained.\n\nThe programme, originally conceived in 1997 to replace the ageing Soviet\u2011origin Kilo (Sindhughosh) submarines, has faced repeated delays. The first P\u201175(I) submarine is now projected for delivery in 2032\u201133, with a total cost estimated at Rs 43,000\u202fcrore plus an additional Rs 27,000\u202fcrore, bringing the project cost to roughly Rs 70,000\u202fcrore. TKMS has offered a customised Type\u2011214\u2011based design, displacing about 3,000\u202ftonnes, armed with 18 heavyweight torpedoes and 12 land\u2011attack or anti\u2011ship cruise missiles, and featuring air\u2011independent propulsion that could keep the vessel submerged for up to three weeks.\n\nThe article notes that the submarine\u2019s design and technology could feed into Project\u201176, which aims to produce 12 indigenous conventional diesel\u2011electric submarines, and that India is also building two nuclear\u2011powered attack submarines.\n\nOn the broader Indo\u2011German defence relationship, the piece highlights a historical trajectory: the first German\u2011made Type\u2011209 submarines entered Indian service in 1986, and since 2006 India and Germany have signed several defence cooperation agreements, culminating in a 2019 Berlin agreement to deepen defence industry ties. In 2024, Germany\u2019s \u2018Focus on India\u2019 paper and a proposed memorandum of arrangement for mutual logistical support signal a renewed emphasis on Indo\u2011Pacific security cooperation.\n\nKey metrics: 6 submarines, Rs 70,000\u202fcrore project value, 3,000\u2011tonne displacement, 18 torpedoes, 12 missiles, 3\u2011week submerged endurance, 2032\u201133 delivery, 27,000\u202fcrore cost increase. Quotes: 'The project was originally conceived way back in 1997', 'The submarine will also feature air\u2011independent propulsion and diesel\u2011electric propulsion, enabling it to remain submerged for up to three weeks at a stretch'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 24, 2025 11:34 AM\nSource:[The Tribune](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/defence/explainer-growing-military-ties-with-germany-a-collaborator-in-indias-latest-submarine-project/)\n\n**India Considers Leasing Second Nuclear-Powered Attack Submarine from Russia**\nIndia is considering leasing a second nuclear-powered attack submarine of the Akula class from Russia, following the INS Arighaat, which was commissioned in 2023. The Indian Navy has a history of leasing submarines from the Soviet Union and Russia to acquire the necessary skills for its nuclear-powered submarine program. The program aims to have four units, with the first one, INS Chakra, being leased from Russia in 2012 and returned in 2021. A new agreement was signed with Russia in 2023 for a second Akula-class submarine, but the delivery has been delayed due to Western sanctions and is now expected in 2028. Meanwhile, India has launched the project 75 Alpha, which aims to build two nuclear-powered submarines domestically, with a potential French partnership, at an estimated cost of $5.4 billion. The first submarine is expected to be operational in 2035. It is unclear which Akula-class submarine will be involved in the potential lease agreement, with options including the K-519 Iribis, K-335 Gepard, K-157 Vepr, or K-295 Samara, all of which have recently undergone modernization.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 06, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[opex360.com](https://www.opex360.com/2025/08/06/la-russie-envisagerait-de-proposer-a-linde-de-lui-louer-un-second-sous-marin-nucleaire-dattaque-de-type-akula/)\n\n**UK and Australia Sign 50-Year Treaty for Nuclear-Powered Submarines**\nThe UK and Australia have announced a 50-year treaty to cooperate on building Australian submarines with nuclear propulsion. The agreement was signed by UK Defense Secretary John Healey and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles on Saturday. Marles said, 'It's a treaty as important as the one we signed between our two countries since federation.' The trilateral alliance was announced in 2021 to counter China's growing military power in the Asia-Pacific region. The agreement, known as AUKUS, will provide Australia with at least eight submarines, including three to five used Virginia-class submarines from the US. The UK and Australia will work together to build their own SSN-AUKUS submarines. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is reviewing the pact, established by the previous administration of President Joe Biden. There are concerns that the US may not provide Australia with its first Virginia-class submarine by the early 2030s, as planned, due to delays in the construction of that armament in the US. Marles and Healey declined to speculate on whether the UK and Australia would continue building submarines together if the US were to withdraw. Healey said, 'Australia and the UK welcome the review because we see this as an opportunity for a new administration to renew its commitment to AUKUS. And that's what we expect.' He added, 'Any kind of hypothesis that suggests we simply won't form part of the picture.' The Australian government confirmed this week that it made a second payment of $500 million to the US under the AUKUS agreement. The first payment of $500 million was made in February. It is expected that the submarines will cost Australia up to $245 billion.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 25, 2025 09:25 AM\nSource:[Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/07/25/reino-unido-y-australia-firmarn-tratado-de-submarinos-nucleares-por-50-aos/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts, representing diverse disciplines such as Defense Policy Analysis, Diplomacy, Naval Strategy, International Relations, Security Studies, and South Asian Area Studies, unanimously assess the probability that the US will offer India a nuclear submarine before January 1, 2026, as extremely low (1\u20132%). Across all perspectives, the main reasons cited are:\n\n1. **Base Rate and Precedent:** The US has only ever offered nuclear submarine technology to the UK and, recently, Australia (AUKUS)\u2014the latter after years of negotiation, exceptional alliance trust, and unique geopolitical circumstance. Even for close treaty allies like South Korea, a formal agreement has been elusive and slow.\n\n2. **Non-Proliferation and Legal Constraints:** US law (Atomic Energy Act), strong nonproliferation norms, and congressional oversight make transfer of naval nuclear propulsion technology highly restrictive. India is a non-NPT nuclear weapons state, further complicating legal and political pathways.\n\n3. **India\u2019s Strategic Autonomy and Indigenous Development:** India prioritizes self-reliance in defense technology (e.g., 'Make in India'), is making rapid progress with its indigenous SSN/SSBN programs, and continues to source nuclear submarines from Russia. There are no public signals of India seeking a US nuclear submarine deal.\n\n4. **Current US-India Relations:** While US-India defense cooperation is deepening (joint exercises, conventional platform sales, tech transfer in select domains), there is no evidence of movement toward a nuclear submarine agreement. India is not a formal US treaty ally, nor within the 'inner circle' of trusted US defense partners.\n\n5. **Geopolitical Drivers:** While China\u2019s naval buildup and Indo-Pacific rivalry provide strategic incentives for closer US-India ties, experts agree these have not\u2014and are unlikely to\u2014overcome the high institutional, legal, and political barriers in the near term.\n\n6. **Lack of News/Signals:** All major recent news coverage and official statements focus on the US-Australia (AUKUS) and US-South Korea cases, and on India\u2019s own domestic and non-US partnerships. No leaks, rumors, or formal negotiations about a US-India nuclear submarine deal have emerged.\n\n7. **Time Constraint:** Less than two months remain before the resolution deadline. Given the historical pace (years for AUKUS), the chances of a sudden, unprecedented breakthrough are effectively nil.\n\n**Typical scenarios outlined:**\n- In the 'No' outcome, India continues developing its own submarines, leverages Russian (and potentially European) support, and strengthens non-nuclear defense ties with the US. \n- The 'Yes' scenario would require a dramatic geopolitical shock and swift political/legal changes, for which there is absolutely no evidence.\n\n**Conclusion:** The collective forecast probability is at the practical floor (1\u20132%), reflecting overwhelming evidence, historical precedent, institutional barriers, and the absence of any signaling of imminent change.",
