The last-minute, divided opposition coalescence around Fernando Dias will not substitute for organizational capacity or enthusiasm, especially with ongoing repression and evident institutional bias. The recent base rate for incumbents in similar African electoral settings, where the main opposition is excluded, is >90% for regime retention.

Embal\u00f3\u2019s control of media, the judiciary, security organs, and parliament underscores an environment of consolidated, soft authoritarian rule. Recent coup attempts have been foiled with security loyalty maintained, making a last-minute nigh-impossible disruption. There is historical precedent\u2014both regional and in Guinea-Bissau\u2014that manipulated elections following opposition exclusion strongly correlate with incumbent wins, usually with lopsided percentages. The most credible 'No' pathways are all highly improbable within the event horizon (coup, death, total regime fissure, mass abstention with overwhelming protest vote).

The official exclusion of PAIGC and its longtime leader (Sim\u00f5es Pereira)\u2014on highly dubious procedural grounds\u2014removes the single structural threat to Embal\u00f3's rule. While the endorsement of Fernando Dias and some internal PAIGC protest suggest marginal contestation, opposition fragmentation and demobilization are typical under these conditions, and no alternative coalition matching PAIGC's mobilizational reach exists. All signals from elite and security structures point toward a highly managed electoral process, minimizing all but the most remote possibilities of regime defeat. Comparative cases (Mozambique 2019, Togo 2020, etc.) reinforce the extremely high predictive value of regime control in similar settings. Big, open fraud or violence could generate post-election instability or lead to international condemnation, but absent hard evidence of a real threat to ballot control, the chance of Embal\u00f3 not being re-elected is vanishingly small.",

The group, including ministers Jos\u00e9 Carlos Esteves (Minister of Public Works) and Carlos Pinto Pereira (Minister of Foreign Affairs), criticized the PAIGC leadership's decision to support Fernando Dias da Costa, an independent candidate from the PRS party, in the upcoming presidential election. They argue the decision, made via a public vote by raising arms at the Central Committee, was illegal and violated party statutes, which require secret ballots. The group claims the vote was invalid and demands that internal party organs annul the decision. This follows the exclusion of Sim\u00f5es Pereira and the PAIGC-led coalition PAI-Terra Ranka from both the presidential and legislative elections, after the Supreme Court rejected their candidacies. The PAIGC, historically dominant, has been removed from power following the dissolution of the National People's Assembly by President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3, who appointed a presidential-initiative government. Sim\u00f5es Pereira, who lost the 2019 presidential election to Embal\u00f3, was preparing to run again but was barred from both elections. The PAIGC has not publicly declared its stance on the legislative elections, which are scheduled for November 23, 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 06:09 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-002/dirigentes-do-paigc-no-governo-pedem-sa%C3%ADda-de-sim%C3%B5es-pereira/a-74634053)\n\n**Fifth Day of an Electoral Campaign Heating Up in Guinea-Bissau**\nThe presidential election campaign in Guinea-Bissau is intensifying, with Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3, Fernando Dias, Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, Siga Batista, and Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz as key figures. Incumbent President Sissoco Embal\u00f3 has been campaigning in southern Guinea-Bissau, emphasizing that his generation is 'the generation of truth that does not lie to the people.' He claimed that during his first term, he built more hospitals, roads, and provided clean water to communities than the PAIGC did in 50 years, and asserted that political assassinations have ceased under his leadership. He urged southern voters not to be misled by the PAIGC's choice of Fernando Dias as its presidential candidate, stating he is confident of re-election on November 23. In contrast, Fernando Dias\u2019s campaign, now supported by members of PAI-Terra Ranka, expresses confidence in victory. M\u00e1rio Famb\u00e9, Dias\u2019s campaign director, called for citizens to unite behind Dias to 'restore freedom to citizens.' Ant\u00f3nio Patroc\u00ednio Barbosa of the PAIGC leadership declared that 'nothing will stop Fernando Dias\u2019s victory' and promised 'true change' in Guinea-Bissau. However, a faction of PAIGC leaders, including Foreign Minister Carlos Pinto Pereira, opposes the party\u2019s endorsement of Dias, arguing it violates party statutes because the decision was made by a show of hands rather than a secret ballot.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 04:40 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/pt/%C3%A1frica-lus%C3%B3fona/20251105-quinto-dia-de-uma-campanha-eleitoral-que-come%C3%A7a-a-aquecer-na-guin%C3%A9-bissau)\n\n**afriquinfos.com Explores the Inner Workings of African Politics**\nafriquinfos.com publishes a comprehensive analysis of current political developments across Africa, covering multiple countries and issues.

The agreement includes a pre-election commitment to mobilize PAIGC supporters and a post-election pledge from Dias to restore the National People's Assembly and ensure full constitutional compliance. Despite historical rivalry between PAIGC and PRS, Pereira emphasized that national unity and the defense of democracy outweigh past divisions. He rejected a boycott, arguing that low turnout would legitimize the incumbent president, Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3, and stressed that the PAIGC's role is to offer the Guinean people a viable alternative to authoritarianism.

The Supreme Court rejected Pereira\u2019s candidacy, citing a late submission of documents\u2014denied by Pereira, who claims he submitted the paperwork on September 19, within the deadline of September 25. This exclusion follows a pattern: Pereira previously criticized the regime for using coup allegations as a pretext to consolidate power, citing a February 1, 2025, incident when the president reportedly seized authority and requested military reinforcement from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The government is also accused of silencing journalists to manipulate the electoral process. A separate allegation emerged of a coup attempt involving two generals\u2014Mamadu Tur\u00e9 and Fernando da Silva\u2014who claimed to have thwarted a plot led by brigadeiro-general Daba Na Walna, who allegedly requested weapons and body armor under false pretenses. Meanwhile, a protest in Lisbon, organized by the collective Firkidja di Pubis, condemned the regime of President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3, demanding democracy and human rights. The protest highlighted the disappearance of 12 activists from the Revolutionary Movement 'P\u00f3 di Terra' and the alleged ongoing use of violence against dissenters since February 27, 2020. Samanta Fernandes, a recent law graduate from Lisbon, joined the demonstration, calling the elections 'already a fait accompli' and criticizing the instrumentalization of the Supreme Court. The movement continues to demand a just, free, and equal society where citizens can express dissent without fear.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 10:22 AM\nSource:[esquerda.net](https://www.esquerda.net/artigo/ativistas-raptados-alegacoes-de-golpe-e-principal-dirigente-da-oposicao-excluido-das)\n\n**Fifth Day of an Electoral Campaign Heating Up in Guinea-Bissau**\nThe presidential election campaign in Guinea-Bissau is intensifying, with Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3, Fernando Dias, Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira, Siga Batista, and Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz as key figures.

The demonstration, organized by the collectives 'Firkidja di Pubis' and 'Movimento Revolucion\u00e1rio P\u00f3 di Terra (MRPT)', was in solidarity with 12 activists allegedly abducted in Bissau during the early hours of November 2, 2025, by heavily armed men. The group claims the abduction was orchestrated by forces loyal to Embal\u00f3's regime. The activists were preparing for a nationwide protest on November 1, 2025, to denounce alleged atrocities committed since February 27, 2020. Yussef, a member of the MRPT, stated that the regime and state security forces are directly responsible for the safety of the abducted citizens. Protesters in Lisbon carried signs with slogans such as 'Out Sissoco', 'Down with the dictatorship', and 'Down with opportunistic generals'. Participants included Samanta Fernandes, a recent law graduate from the University of Lisbon, who joined the protest against what she described as the 'dictatorial regime' of Embal\u00f3. The organizers condemned the exclusion of major political forces\u2014such as the PAIGC and the PAI-Terra Ranka coalition\u2014from the upcoming November 23, 2025, elections by the Supreme Court of Justice (STJ), which admitted only 12 presidential candidates. Samanta Fernandes criticized the STJ for what she called the 'instrumentalization' of the judiciary, stating it should uphold the rule of law, not undermine it. Amadeu da Silva, another demonstrator, expressed concern over the country\u2019s trajectory and rejected the current regime, questioning how Guineans can return to a nation under such leadership. He emphasized that democracy requires inclusive and transparent elections and expressed hope that the people of Guinea-Bissau will ultimately decide their future, despite the current silence of the Supreme Court.

The country's 860,000 voters are set to elect a president and 102 members of the new National People's Assembly on November 23, 2025. Fourteen political parties are contesting the legislative election, while 12 candidates, including incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 and former president Jos\u00e9 Mario Vaz, are running for the presidency. Ten other candidates include civil society figures, former ministers, and retired military officers. The central issue is restoring stability in a nation marked by over a decade of coups, military crises, and clan rivalries. The day before the campaign began, General Mamadu Ture, Deputy Chief of Staff of the armed forces, announced a failed coup involving several officers, with an investigation ongoing. President Embal\u00f3 opened the campaign in the Bairro de Ajuda neighborhood, using irony to downplay the coup threat, stating he would run without a bulletproof vest: 'Look, neither do I have a vest. Let whoever wants confrontation come forward. We came to power through the ballot box, and we will leave through the ballot box. Nothing else.' The historic African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), a key force in the country\u2019s independence and subsequent politics, was excluded from the elections due to administrative irregularities, according to official sources. Opposition leader Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira chose not to boycott and instead formed a support agreement with independent candidate Fernando Dias to maintain symbolic presence. Observers warn that the PAIGC\u2019s exclusion undermines democratic credibility, risks voter abstention among its supporters, and could weaken the legitimacy of the next government. Guinea-Bissau has experienced around ten coups or attempted coups since independence in 1974. President Embal\u00f3, elected in 2019, dissolved the parliament in 2022 amid institutional crises, held early legislative elections in 2023, and faced a brief, unstable cohabitation with the PAIGC, which collapsed in December 2023, leading to a renewed political crisis.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 11:46 AM\nSource:[RT en Fran\u00e7ais](https://francais.rt.com/afrique/126984-guinee-bissau-entame-campagne-21-jours-elections-generales)\n\n**Guinea-Bissau Launches Election Campaign Amid Opposition Exclusion and Military Crackdown**\nThe electoral campaign in Guinea-Bissau officially began on Saturday, three weeks ahead of the scheduled legislative and presidential elections on November 23, 2025. This election cycle is marked by the absence of major opposition forces, as the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC)\u2014the historic liberation movement\u2014was excluded from the race by the Supreme Court. The court ruled that the party and its coalition, 'Ba\u00eda Terra Rancra' (led by Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira), failed to submit their candidacies on time, sparking widespread controversy over the fairness of the electoral process. The military announced the thwarting of a 'plot to undermine the constitutional order' and the arrest of several senior officers, with Deputy Chief of Staff General Mamadu Turi stating the aim was to 'disrupt the electoral process.' President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 reiterated that 'any chaos will not be tolerated' in a country that has experienced four coups and numerous failed attempts since independence from Portugal in 1974. With approximately 860,000 registered voters, citizens will choose from 12 presidential candidates\u2014including Embal\u00f3 and former president Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz\u2014and 102 parliamentary seats contested by 14 parties, including the pro-Embalo coalition 'Novo Comit\u00e9 Guineense.'

The PAIGC, which won the 2023 legislative elections, claims the Supreme Court acted in bad faith by rejecting their filings. Twelve candidates are running for president, including incumbent Umaro Sissoco Embalo seeking a second term and former president Jos\u00e9 Mario Vaz. Fourteen political parties, including the coalition N\u00f4 Kumpu Guin\u00e9 supporting Embalo, are contesting the 102 parliamentary seats. Just hours before the campaign launch, the military announced it had foiled a 'subversion of the constitutional order' and arrested several senior officers, though it did not disclose the number or specific actions. The country, which has experienced four coups d'\u00e9tat, seventeen attempted coups, and frequent government changes since independence in 1974, faces heightened political tension. President Embalo warned against 'any chaos,' while election commission head Mpabi Cabi called the vote a key step toward stability. The 2019 election, which also pitted Embalo against Sim\u00f5es Pereira, was highly contested and led to a four-month post-electoral deadlock before the ECOWAS recognized Embalo\u2019s victory. Today, Sim\u00f5es Pereira\u2019s opposition argues Embalo is no longer the legitimate president, as his term expired in 2025. The country\u2019s instability and poverty have also facilitated the presence of drug traffickers using Guinea-Bissau as a transit route for cocaine from Latin America to Europe.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 07:15 AM\nSource:[TV5MONDE](https://information.tv5monde.com/afrique/guinee-bissau-la-campagne-electorale-souvre-sans-le-principal-parti-dopposition-2796804)\n\n**Campaigning kicks off in G.Bissau vote without main opposition**\nCampaigning began on Saturday in Guinea-Bissau ahead of legislative and presidential elections on November 23, 2025, with incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embalo expected to dominate the race after the disqualification of the main opposition parties. For the first time in the country\u2019s history, the PAIGC party\u2014historically central to the 1974 independence movement\u2014and the Pai Terra Ranka coalition, led by Embalo\u2019s rival Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira, were barred from the ballot by the Supreme Court for submitting applications too late. The court\u2019s decision excluded around 10 parties, including PAIGC, from the final list. The country\u2019s army reported thwarting an 'attempt to subvert the constitutional order' on Friday, arresting several senior military officers, which General Mamadu Ture described as an effort to disrupt the electoral process. Embalo, who was first elected in December 2019 and initially pledged to serve only one term, dissolved parliament in 2023 after armed clashes he labeled an attempted coup, a move condemned by Pereira as a 'constitutional coup.' The election will feature 12 presidential candidates, including Embalo and former president Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz, and 14 parties contesting 102 parliamentary seats, with the No Kumpu Guine coalition supporting Embalo. Political analyst Fransual Dias stated that with 'serious opponents eliminated from the competition,' Embalo\u2019s victory is a 'foregone conclusion.' Political stability remains a central concern, given Guinea-Bissau\u2019s history of four coups since independence, including one in 2012, and repeated coup attempts. Embalo postponed the election to November 2025, drawing accusations of extending his rule beyond his constitutional mandate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 01, 2025 02:27 AM\nSource:[Digital Journal](https://www.digitaljournal.com/world/campaigning-kicks-off-in-g-bissau-vote-without-main-opposition/article)\n\n**In Guinea-Bissau, President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 Claims Coup Attempt Foiled**\nIn Guinea-Bissau, President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 stated that a 'coup d'\u00c9tat attempt' had been thwarted, asserting the plot aimed to disrupt the electoral process.

Sim\u00f5es Pereira, contacted by DW \u00c1frica, said he was unavailable due to leading a meeting at the PAIGC headquarters in Bissau, attended by key opposition candidates, including former President Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz, who accused Embal\u00f3 of having 'undermined democracy' in the country.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 02:58 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-002/sissoco-diz-que-vit%C3%B3ria-%C3%A0-primeira-volta-%C3%A9-garantida/a-74558909)\n\n**Supporter of Embal\u00f3 Calls for Dialogue Between Sim\u00f5es Pereira and President**\nBotche Cand\u00e9, a key supporter of Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3's re-election bid and coordinator of the Republican Platform\u2014a coalition backing Embal\u00f3\u2019s second five-year term\u2014called on opposition leader Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira to engage in dialogue with the President of Guinea-Bissau. Speaking in a town in the interior of the country, Cand\u00e9 urged Sim\u00f5es Pereira to seek out Embal\u00f3 and vice versa, emphasizing the need for unity to prevent the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) from declining. This appeal comes after the Supreme Court of Justice (STJ) barred the Alliance Inclusiva (PAI - Terra Ranka) from participating in the upcoming elections on November 23, 2025, which include both legislative and presidential votes. The PAI, led by the PAIGC and previously aligned with Sim\u00f5es Pereira, was excluded after the dissolution of the majority-led parliament in 2023. Sim\u00f5es Pereira\u2019s presidential candidacy was rejected by the STJ due to procedural delays. Cand\u00e9 cited Senegal\u2019s example, where Ousmane Sonko, barred from running, endorsed Diomaye Faye, who was elected days after being released from prison. Cand\u00e9 warned that the PAIGC risks 'dying' if its leader persists in seeking the presidency alone. He affirmed that he would never insult Sim\u00f5es Pereira, whom he considers a brother, and reiterated his call for national political unity under Embal\u00f3\u2019s leadership, stating, 'I make an appeal to the unity of all Guinean politicians under the leadership of Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3, so that we may make history in Guinea-Bissau.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 05:53 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-002/apoiante-de-embal%C3%B3-pede-entendimento-com-sim%C3%B5es-pereira/a-74516676)\n\n**Opposition in Guinea-Bissau Denied Participation in Upcoming Elections**\nThe Supreme Court of Guinea-Bissau has barred the historic African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and the main opposition coalition, 'Bai Tera Ranka', from participating in the upcoming presidential and legislative elections on November 23, 2025, citing late submission of candidacies. The court's final ruling, issued on October 17, 2025, stated that opposition leader and former Prime Minister Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira submitted his presidential candidacy for PAIGC after the legal deadline, following an initial failed attempt via the unregistered coalition. Pereira leads 'Bai Tera Ranka', a coalition of around 10 parties, including PAIGC, which led Guinea-Bissau to independence from Portugal in 1974. The court had previously ruled in September 2025 that the coalition was ineligible for legislative elections due to late filing, and PAIGC did not submit any parliamentary candidacy. Pereira returned to Guinea-Bissau in mid-September 2025 after nine months abroad, citing threats to his life and legal persecution, and declared before his return that he would lead a 'democratic struggle' domestically. In contrast, incumbent President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 has been officially registered as a presidential candidate. Embal\u00f3 defeated Pereira in the 2019 elections, a result Pereira rejected vehemently. In 2023, Embal\u00f3 dissolved the opposition-dominated parliament following armed clashes, which Pereira\u2014then speaker\u2014labeled a 'constitutional coup'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 10:19 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/10/19/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%b6%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%a6%d9%8a%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%ba%d9%8a%d9%86%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%b3%d8%a7%d9%88-%d8%ae%d8%a7%d8%b1%d8%ac)\n\n**Guinea-Bissau: Sim\u00f5es Pereira Warns Democracy Is at Risk After PAIGC and PAI Excluded from Elections**\nDomingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira, leader of the historic African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) and the inclusive alliance PAI-Terra Ranka, warned on October 17, 2025, that democracy in Guinea-Bissau is at risk following the exclusion of his party and the PAI alliance from the upcoming general, legislative, and presidential elections scheduled for November 23. The exclusion, confirmed by the Supreme Court of Justice, rejected the PAI-Terra Ranka and API Cabas Garandi coalitions' legislative candidacies and did not rule on Sim\u00f5es Pereira\u2019s presidential bid. Sim\u00f5es Pereira stated that the exclusion stems from his role as the main opposition figure to President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3, the incumbent candidate for a second term. He emphasized that the excluded coalitions are uniting to defend democratic foundations and fundamental freedoms, calling for inclusive elections. Sim\u00f5es Pereira postponed a planned peaceful march to the Supreme Court to better prepare it, while demanding equal treatment and awaiting formal responses to legal appeals. Fernando Dias, leader of the PRS and API Cabas Garandi, who is an independent presidential candidate, urged calm and expressed belief that the court may reverse its decision, stating that excluding PAI and API would exclude 70% of the population from the electoral process. The Supreme Court accepted 12 presidential candidates and only one legislative coalition\u2014the Republic Platform supporting the current president. The civil movement 'P\u00f4 de Terra' also condemned the court\u2019s decision, calling it a political tool serving a regime that fears the people, and announced a national demonstration for November 1. The movement\u2019s spokesperson, Vig\u00e1rio Lu\u00eds Balanta, accused the Supreme Court of abandoning its constitutional role as guardian of the Constitution and becoming a political instrument of manipulation.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 05:58 PM\nSource:[Observador](https://observador.pt/2025/10/17/guine-bissau-simoes-pereira-alerta-que-democracia-esta-em-risco-apos-paigc-e-coligacao-pai-serem-excluidos-das-eleicoes/)\n\n**Exclusion of Key Opposition Candidate in Guinea-Bissau Presidential Election Raises Political Tensions**\nThe Supreme Court of Guinea-Bissau excluded prominent opposition leader and former Prime Minister Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira from the preliminary list of presidential candidates for the upcoming election on November 23, 2025, escalating political tensions in the country. Pereira leads the main opposition coalition 'Bai Tera Ranka,' which includes around 10 parties. The court had previously excluded the same coalition from the September 2025 legislative elections due to late submission of candidacy applications. According to Eduardo Sanka, a member of the central committee of the party, Pereira submitted his candidacy application late, initially attempting to register through the coalition, which was not permitted. The court received 14 candidacy applications, but only 12 names were included in the preliminary list after one candidate withdrew. The preliminary list includes current President Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 and former President Jos\u00e9 M\u00e1rio Vaz (2019\u20132014). The final list of candidates is expected to be published before October 23, 2025. Pereira returned to Guinea-Bissau in late September 2025 after a nine-month absence, only to face renewed conflict with his long-time rival Embal\u00f3, whom he lost to in the 2019 election amid widespread controversy over the results. Embal\u00f3 postponed the elections to November 2025 in February 2020, citing logistical and financial challenges. In 2023, the opposition-dominated parliament was dissolved following armed clashes described as a coup attempt. The exclusion of Pereira adds a new chapter to the ongoing power struggle between the government and opposition, raising concerns about increased division and instability in a country that has experienced repeated political crises and coups since independence.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/10/14/%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%ad%d9%83%d9%85%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%a8%d8%b9%d8%af-%d8%a3%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%b2-%d9%85%d8%b1%d8%b4%d8%ad%d9%8a)\n\n**Domingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira Announces Candidacy for Guinea\u2011Bissau Presidency \u2013 Teranga News**\nDomingos Sim\u00f5es Pereira, former Prime Minister and President of the National Assembly of Guinea\u2011Bissau, officially announced his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election scheduled for 23 November 2025. After more than a year in exile in Lisbon following the dissolution of the National Assembly in December 2023, he said he intends to return to the country to run. In a meeting with the Bissau\u2011Guinean diaspora in Lisbon, Pereira stated his willingness to present a candidate for Prime Minister if he wins. He also criticized the recent expulsion of Portuguese media, calling it evidence of the 'absence de d\u00e9mocratie' in the country. If his profile is validated by the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC), he will attempt a fourth presidential bid.

They argue that Embal\u00f3\u2019s mandate, which began in February 2020, should have ended at the start of the year in accordance with the Constitution. In March 2025, Embal\u00f3 announced his candidacy for a second term, stating he expects to win the vote in the first round. Candidates for the upcoming presidential and legislative elections must file their dossiers by 25 September 2025. The legislative elections, originally set for November 2024, were postponed by one year for logistical and financial reasons. Additionally, Embal\u00f3\u2019s administration has drawn criticism from Reporters Without Borders (RSF). In August, authorities suspended three Portuguese\u2011language public media outlets\u2014RTP Africa, RDP, and Ag\u00eancia Lusa\u2014for an indefinite period without official explanation, ordering their correspondents to leave the country by 19 August.

Embal\u00f3 stated, 'I will not be a hostage to anyone, but the President of the Republic. However, all political parties and associations that want to support me will be welcome.' The president is seeking a second term in office. Embal\u00f3 made the announcement during the inauguration ceremony for the new prime minister, Braima Camara, who became the third head of government since Embal\u00f3 took power in 2020. The president will not run on behalf of his party, the Movement for Democratic Alternation (MADEM-G15). The elections were originally scheduled for November 24, 2024, but were postponed by the president in March due to technical issues. The opposition rejected the postponement. The early call for elections was due to the crisis triggered in December 2023 by the assault on a police station by members of the National Guard, which was seen as an attempt to overthrow the government. Embal\u00f3 subsequently appointed a new government and dissolved the National People's Assembly (APN). The presidential election has also generated tension in the country, as the opposition argued that Embal\u00f3's five-year term ended on February 27, 2025, while the Supreme Court ruled that it ended in September, supporting the president. The political crisis in the country led the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to deploy a mission in February, which was forced to leave after Embal\u00f3 threatened to expel it. Guinea-Bissau has been plagued by political instability since 2015 and has experienced numerous military uprisings and four successful coups since its independence from Portugal in 1973.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: August 09, 2025 10:23 AM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/el-presidente-embal%C3%B3-de-guinea-bis%C3%A1u-concurrir%C3%A1-en-las-elecciones-como-independiente/89807792)\n\n**G.Bissau leader to run as independent amid political crisis**\nGuinea-Bissau President Umaro Sissoco Embalo announced his candidacy for the November presidential elections as an independent, citing his desire not to be 'anyone's hostage'. Embalo, who was originally elected in 2019 for a five-year term, had stated he would only serve once, but postponed the election date until November this year, sparking months of turmoil. He created a new 'Move Forward Together' movement under which he will campaign, and welcomed support from any political parties, corporate bodies, or religious organizations. Embalo's decision comes as he inaugurated his new prime minister, Braima Camara, and replaced opposition party prime minister Rui Duarte Barros, whom he sacked on Thursday. 'I will not be any political party's candidate because I don't want to be anyone's hostage,' Embalo said, 'Any political parties, corporate bodies or religious organisations that wish to support me are welcome,' he added.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 08, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[AFP](https://afp.com/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All experts, drawing on different disciplinary perspectives (election monitoring, intelligence and risk analysis, political science theories, African studies, and sociology), converge on a near-unanimous view: there is an overwhelming probability (ranging from 93% to 98%) that Umaro Sissoco Embal\u00f3 will be re-elected president of Guinea-Bissau in the 2025 election. This consensus is primarily grounded in the exclusion of the principal opposition party (PAIGC) and its leader through Supreme Court rulings, fragmentation and demoralization of remaining opposition forces, manipulation of the judiciary and electoral institutions, and robust control of the security apparatus by the incumbent. Experts note the election is proceeding in an environment characterized by repression, media clampdowns, activist disappearances, and an absence of meaningful international intervention or leverage (ECOWAS, AU, EU). Theoretically, a 'No' outcome (i.e., Embal\u00f3 not being re-elected) is judged possible only if there is an unprecedented, swift and large-scale shock\u2014such as a successful military coup, mass popular uprising, a dramatic and unified opposition surge, or overwhelming international intervention\u2014all of which are assessed as highly unlikely within the brief window remaining before the vote. The base rate for incumbents winning manipulated or exclusionary elections in similar African regimes is cited as well above 90%, reinforcing the view that barring a major, unforeseeable disruption, Embal\u00f3's re-election is all but certain.",
