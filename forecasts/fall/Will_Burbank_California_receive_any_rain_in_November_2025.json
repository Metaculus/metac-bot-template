The Southern Hydrometeorological Station warned that tide peaks at Phu An Station on the Saigon River could reach 1.70\u20131.75 m\u2014above the third warning level, the highest alert\u2014between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. on Thursday and Friday. This follows Typhoon Kalmaegi's expected entry into the East Sea (South China Sea) on Wednesday, which may bring up to 100 mm of rain to the city. Le Dinh Quyet, head of the weather forecasting department, stated that the combination of strong tides and heavy rain will cause severe flooding in low-lying areas and along the Saigon River. He warned that five to six more tidal peaks are expected in the final two months of 2025, and if they coincide with heavy rain or strong northeasterly winds, the flooding risk will be 'very serious.' Earlier in October, tides reached a record 1.77 m, submerging the Binh Quoi tourist area by up to one meter and affecting hundreds of households in Thanh Da. Major roads such as Tran Xuan Soan, Pham Huu Lau, and National Highway 50 were submerged, disrupting traffic. In southern provinces, including Can Tho and Vinh Long, water levels exceeded 2.3 m\u2014surpassing 2022 records\u2014causing widespread flooding of streets, homes, fruit gardens, and aquaculture ponds.

Is fire season over now?**\nIn October 2025, California experienced significantly above-average rainfall, particularly in Northern California, leading fire experts to assess whether fire season has ended. According to Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, fire season has likely ended in Northern California due to sufficient rainfall, while Southern California remains at elevated risk. Statewide, 522,372 acres had burned by October 27, a 40% decrease from the 5-year average of 1.3 million acres. Northern California saw substantial rain: San Jose received 2 inches (400% of average), Oakland 1.64 inches (195%), Sacramento 2 inches (200%), Santa Rosa 125%, and San Francisco 113%. Southern California rainfall was uneven\u2014Los Angeles received 1.41 inches (252% of average), Fresno 1.18 inches (223%), but San Diego and Palm Springs remained below average. A single storm on October 15 brought most of Southern California\u2019s rain, followed by rising temperatures (97\u00b0F in LA) and red flag warnings issued by the National Weather Service. In response, Governor Gavin Newsom pre-positioned 129 firefighters, 10 engines, and three helicopters. In contrast, Cal Fire canceled controlled burns in Soquel Demonstration Forest and halted a planned burn in San Mateo County due to damp vegetation. Cal Fire forester Sarah Collamer stated, 'We are getting small starts. They are going until we put them out. But the fire danger is greatly reduced.' Grass fires near Alum Rock Park (10 acres) and Altamont Pass (20 acres) were quickly contained. Craig Clements of San Jose State University noted that while grass fires can still ignite, they are unlikely to spread due to high moisture levels and green-up in the hills. The National Interagency Fire Center lists 'little or no fire risk' for most of California, except for 'low risk' in parts of southern California. Experts agree there is no fixed rainfall threshold to end fire season, but 1 inch of rain is often a benchmark. Dan Cayan of Scripps Institution of Oceanography noted that 90% of Southern California\u2019s fall fires since WWII occurred before 0.35 inches of rain fell. However, winter dry spells and Santa Ana winds can still spark fires. Historically, major fires have occurred in fall (e.g., 1991 Oakland Hills Fire, 2017 Tubbs Fire, 2018 Camp Fire), prompting officials to declare fire season year-round due to climate change. Yet, fire risk generally declines with rain, cooler temperatures, and shorter days. Cal Fire has relaxed back-yard burning rules starting October 17, allowing permits across nearly all Bay Area counties and all counties north to Oregon. Cal Fire stations have not yet reduced staffing. Capt. Robert Foxworthy warned, 'We could still have 80-degree days with winds. There's still a chance of wildfire. We're not expecting large damaging, destructive fires... but in some places there is a threat still there.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 03:51 PM\nSource:[San Jose Mercury News](https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/31/it-rained-a-lot-in-october-is-fire-season-over-now/)\n\n**Belo Horizonte Issues Landslide Alert After Heavy Rains**\nFollowing a full day of heavy rainfall in Belo Horizonte, the city's Civil Defense issued a geological risk alert on Thursday, October 30, 2025, valid until Monday, November 3, 2025, warning of potential landslides in the eastern and northeastern regions.

Burbank saw 2.28 inches, shattering its previous October record of 0.25 inches set in 2009, while new daily rainfall records were also set in Camarillo, Santa Maria, and Lancaster. Evacuations were ordered near the burn scars of the Eaton Fire and Palisades Fire due to the risk of mudslides and flooding, as charred, vegetation-free soil increases runoff. No major mudslides had been reported by Wednesday morning. In the Sierra Nevada, snow blanketed the region, with Mammoth Mountain recording 10 inches; Interstate 80 near Donner Pass saw hazardous conditions, prompting the California Highway Patrol to issue warnings about slick roads and chain controls.

According to Marty Ralph, director of the Center for Western Weather and Water Extremes at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, the storm acted as a 'Goldilocks atmospheric river'\u2014just right to provide beneficial moisture without causing flooding. The rainfall has delayed the fire season by weeks or even months by increasing soil and vegetation moisture, reducing flammability. This is especially significant after more than a year of severe drought, including January's hurricane-strength winds that fueled massive fires in Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and Altadena. While one storm cannot reverse long-term drought or eliminate fire risk, Ralph noted that it provides a favorable start to the water year. However, if the remainder of fall remains dry and Santa Ana winds return, vegetation could dry out again, reigniting fire concerns. As of mid-July 2025, California had already seen over 220,000 acres burned\u2014nearly 100,000 more than the five-year average\u2014driven by early fires and ongoing blazes, though no major fires have occurred in Southern California during the fall of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 02:31 PM\nSource:[Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-10-15/rare-october-rains-could-push-back-la-fire-season)\n\n**Storm pounds LA area with rain, evacuations ordered  --  PHOTOS**\nA rare October storm brought heavy rainfall to Southern California on October 15, 2025, with up to 1.5 inches of rain recorded in most Los Angeles areas and over 5 inches in the San Gabriel Mountains. The storm triggered flash flood warnings in fire-scarred regions, where burned hillsides\u2014rendered impermeable like asphalt\u2014increased the risk of mudslides. Authorities evacuated approximately 115 homes in Pacific Palisades and Mandeville Canyon, areas devastated by a January fire that killed over 30 people and destroyed more than 17,000 structures. Firefighters rescued two people and two dogs from the swollen Los Angeles River; one man was hospitalized for exposure, and one woman declined medical transport. At least two tornado warnings were issued, rockslides were reported, and over 21,000 customers lost power. In Sierra Madre, debris flows trapped cars and damaged garages, while a section of the Pacific Coast Highway was submerged under at least 3 feet (1 meter) of sludge. A Los Angeles Fire Department vehicle was swept into the ocean. The storm followed a dry year, with much of Southern California under moderate to severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Climatologist Curtis Riganti noted the rain was welcome but its long-term drought impact remains uncertain. In the Sierra Nevada, up to 3 feet (1 meter) of snow was forecast, and in Tempe, Arizona, a microburst caused widespread damage, including uprooted trees, roof collapses, and power outages, rendering nine apartment buildings and several homes uninhabitable.

Rainfall totals across California ranged from 0.75 to 1.5 inches, with mountainous areas like the San Gabriel Mountains seeing up to 4 inches. Snowfall began in the Sierra Nevada, marking the first measurable snow of the season. The storm system was fueled by moisture from the Pacific Ocean, with meteorologists noting 'locally high rainfall rates' and 'atypical' conditions for October.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 08:29 PM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/10/14/nation/los-angeles-rain-storm/)\n\n**Atmospheric river slams Southern California with floods, evacuations | Honolulu Star-Advertiser**\nAn intense atmospheric river struck Southern California on October 14, 2025, bringing torrential rains, flash flood warnings, debris flow risks in burn scars from recent wildfires, severe thunderstorms, and tornado warnings. The storm hit Los Angeles in the early morning, with rainfall rates reaching up to 1.5 inches per hour in the Palisades fire burn scar and 3.5 inches per hour in Ventura County\u2019s mountains, prompting flash flood warnings and evacuation alerts. Burned soil\u2019s inability to absorb water increases the risk of debris flows, especially in areas affected by the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, and Sunset fires. The National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings with 60-mph wind gusts and hail potential across west central Los Angeles County. Flash flood watches were in effect through the afternoon, with peak rainfall expected between 9 and 11 a.m. The storm also caused road flooding in the Bay Area, downed trees, and power outages. In preparation, emergency crews pre-deployed strike teams, search-and-rescue units, and swift-water rescue teams. Authorities urged residents to sign up for emergency alerts at NotifyLA.org and heed evacuation warnings, as conditions can change rapidly. The storm system originated in Northern and Central California, where it brought snow to the Sierra, flight delays at San Francisco Airport, and a rare whirlwind over Monterey Bay. Lingering showers were expected to end by Wednesday evening, with normal temperatures and weather returning by Thursday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 05:40 PM\nSource:[Honolulu Star Advertiser](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/10/14/breaking-news/atmospheric-river-slams-southern-california-with-floods-evacuations/)\n\n**Warning issued as California could be hit by significant mudslides**\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) in Los Angeles issued warnings for significant debris flows and flash flooding in Southern California on October 14, 2025, due to heavy rainfall from a Pacific storm. The storm brought over 3 inches of rain\u2014up to 3.5 inches on the Eaton Scar and 3.2 inches on the Bridge Scar\u2014over recent wildfire burn scars, increasing the risk of mudslides and rockslides. Burned soil, which acts like pavement in repelling water, exacerbates runoff, heightening the danger of debris flows. The NWS issued a 'low-moderate risk of SIGNIFICANT flash flooding/debris flows' across burn scars and a 'high risk for rockslides/mudslides and urban roadway flooding.' Additional alerts included a severe thunderstorm watch, special marine warning, and flash flood watch. Heavy snowfall exceeding 3 feet was forecast in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The storm was expected to continue through Tuesday, with most alerts set to expire by Tuesday afternoon. Residents near burn scars, including Bridge, Line, Apple, El Dorado, and Airport, were advised to prepare for flooding and stay updated with local authorities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 03:40 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/warning-california-mudslides-flooding-10877547)\n\n**Early season rainstorm makes its mark**\nA major early-season rainstorm impacted California, exiting the state after triggering flash flood warnings, flight delays, and a rare severe thunderstorm warning for parts of the Los Angeles Basin on October 14, 2025. The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that the rain fell predominantly within a six-hour period, causing more flooding than anticipated in some areas. The warning covered Santa Monica, Burbank, Hollywood, Venice, Altadena, Studio City, and downtown Los Angeles\u2014locations where such warnings are uncommon, with the last one issued on January 27, 2008. The city of Los Angeles issued an evacuation warning for areas near the Palisades Fire burn zone, including Pacific Palisades and Malibu. Before reaching Southern California, the storm brought the season\u2019s first major snow accumulation to the Sierra Nevada, delayed flights at San Francisco International Airport, and produced a visible whirlwind of air and mist over Monterey Bay.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 01:59 PM\nSource:[inlandnewstoday.com](https://inlandnewstoday.com/story.php?s=78927)\n\n**Early Season Storm Dumps On California - Videos from The Weather Channel**\nAn early-season storm is impacting California, posing a flood threat and severe weather risks to Southern California on Tuesday, October 14, 2025. The Weather Channel reports that severe storms may occur in areas including Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Santa Barbara, with the primary hazards being damaging wind gusts. Isolated brief tornadoes and hail are also possible. Heavy rainfall could trigger flooding, particularly near burn scars from previous wildfires.

Burn scar areas are especially vulnerable to hazardous debris flows, prompting residents in these zones to prepare for possible evacuation. The storm system follows an earlier round of precipitation that began on Saturday, with intermittent rain expected through Monday. The National Weather Service noted a 'wet westerly flow pattern' leading to periods of precipitation, with the most significant rainfall anticipated around Saturday night. This event is part of a broader pattern of severe weather impacting various regions globally, including Austria and Ukraine, which have also issued storm warnings for thunderstorms, hail, and strong winds.

This amount equates to 408 liters of water falling on each square meter, equivalent to over four large household water tanks. The 30-year reference period used by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), from 1991 to 2020, shows that only four Septembers\u20141999, 2003, 2008, and 2020\u2014exceeded 350 mm. September 2009 was the driest. In 2025, rainfall in June surpassed the 1991\u20132020 average, exceeding 250 mm, but a severe drought occurred in July due to the 'can\u00edcula' (summer dry spell), with up to 25 days without rain in various regions, according to the National Institute of Seismology, Volcanology, Meteorology, and Hydrology (Insivumeh). Rainfall resumed in late August and intensified in September, exceeding the reference period by 150 mm. W\u00e1lter Arnoldo Bardales Espinosa, a meteorology expert at Agua Consulta, attributes the heavy rains to the passage of eastern waves and favorable atmospheric conditions, noting that while June and September are typically rainy months, June saw dry periods due to high-pressure systems. By September 23, soil saturation in Pet\u00e9n, Huehuetenango, Quich\u00e9, Alta Verapaz, Izabal, Zacapa, El Progreso, Chiquimula, and Jalapa reached or exceeded 90% in the upper layer, increasing landslide and collapse risks in mountainous areas. Agua Consulta forecasts continued heavy rains in October, with severe flooding reported in areas like the Anillo Perif\u00e9rico, Roosevelt Avenue, and Ra\u00fal Aguilar Batres Avenue, disrupting traffic. Insivumeh\u2019s C\u00e9sar George predicts the rainy season may end between October 15 and 25 but warns of possible national-scale precipitation systems. The Northern Transversal Strip and Caribbean regions will remain prone to rain. NOAA is monitoring a low-pressure system south of Mexico, which could develop into a tropical depression by week\u2019s end and trigger disordered rains and thunderstorms in central and southern Guatemala. Bardales warns that with about 25 days of rain already recorded since September, further damage from floods, landslides, and mudslides is likely. He attributes this to climate variability and suggests the season could extend into early November, as in 2020 when hurricanes Eta and Iota caused fatalities and disasters. Insivumeh\u2019s October outlook indicates neutral conditions, but there is a 60% chance of La Ni\u00f1a, a 39% chance of neutral conditions, and a 1% chance of El Ni\u00f1o. La Ni\u00f1a typically brings drier conditions in some areas and increased Atlantic hurricane activity. Cold fronts are expected to begin in late October, marking the start of the cold season, which may last until March or April in some regions, with up to 16 cold fronts forecasted, especially impacting the central highlands and western Guatemala.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 07, 2025 06:05 AM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/comunitario/septiembre-del-2025-ha-sido-el-mas-lluvioso-de-los-ultimos-30-anos-de-registros-mensuales/)\n\n",

    "summary": "All forecasting experts estimate a high probability that Burbank, California will receive measurable rain in November 2025, with individual probabilities ranging from 75% to 88%. The consensus reasoning is based on several key factors:\n\n1. Climatological base rates: Historically, around 70\u201385% of Novembers in Burbank see at least one day of measurable precipitation, supporting a strong baseline for a 'Yes' outcome. Complete absence of rain in November is atypical.\n\n2. Recent weather: While Burbank is on a 17-day dry streak post a record-setting mid-October 2025 rainstorm, experts highlight that previous extreme October events do not preclude subsequent November rainfall.\n\n3. Drought status: Moderate drought is present and slightly reduces the odds, but experts note it does not eliminate the chance of at least one minor rain event, especially after a wet October reset soil/fuel moisture.\n\n4. Current and forecasted patterns: Atmospheric river activity and active Pacific storm tracks are observed impacting Northern and Central California. While early November is dry for Southern California, most experts expect at least one storm system or frontal passage to push south by mid- or late November.\n\n5. Outlooks/models: NOAA and CPC 30-day forecasts (along with global models GFS/ECMWF) call for above-average precipitation probabilities in California for November, including Southern California, increasing confidence in rain reaching Burbank.\n\n6. Teleconnections (ENSO/El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a): No extreme anomaly is currently dominating, though some slight uncertainties about La Ni\u00f1a effects persist. Most agree this is not strong enough to suppress all rain in November.\n\nAcross all perspectives (weather forecasting, climatology, synoptic meteorology, geography, and seasonal climate analysis), experts agree the risk of a rainless November exists but is comparatively low given historic averages, recent anomalies, and model projections. Most foresee at least one weak-to-moderate frontal system or remnant atmospheric river bringing some measurable rain (\u22650.01\") before month's end. Final assigned probabilities for a 'Yes' outcome are: 75, 78, 78, 80, 80, 83, 85, 85, 88\u2014indicating strong consensus with moderate-to-high confidence.",
