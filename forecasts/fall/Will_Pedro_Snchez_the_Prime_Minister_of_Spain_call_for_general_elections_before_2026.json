Junts and/or minor parties abstain or selectively support bare-minimum votes (as happened post-2017).

With mounting pressure and no route to pass major bills or silence opposition calls, S\u00e1nchez calculates that calling elections in late 2025 (to hold polls early in 2026) is preferable to further reputational damage or possible no-confidence maneuvers. He frames the move as necessary to restore stability.",
            "final_reasoning": "As of November 2025, Spain\u2019s government led by S\u00e1nchez is under severe judicial and political pressure, but has survived similar crises before due to the PM\u2019s tactical skills, the lack of parliamentary alternatives, and the flexibility accorded by Spanish election law. Notably, while the opposition is clamoring for early elections and corruption scandals are ongoing, the base rate of snap elections in comparable minority government/corruption scenarios is modest. Defeated budgets or complete deadlock are required to trigger early elections, and S\u00e1nchez is notably resistant to such a move unless forced. However, the lack of a majority, the explicit Junts withdrawal, and judicial momentum are extraordinary and could escalate further. The critical variable is the 2026 budget: if S\u00e1nchez cobbles together votes for even a minimal budget or can govern by extended credits, he is likely to delay elections until 2026. If, however, procedural gridlock becomes absolute (e.g., budget rejection + major scandals), the legal and practical path to an early election is open, as per Article 115 of the Spanish Constitution. Given these competing dynamics and current instability, but weighing the historic reluctance and available procedural evasions, the probability of S\u00e1nchez calling general elections before 2026 stands at 35%.",

Present dynamics\u2014while fraught\u2014still point to executive stonewalling as default, and the opposition's inability (so far) to break deadlock has historically meant governments cling on till the regular calendar. There are no open signs of party mutiny or calls for S\u00e1nchez\u2019s resignation within PSOE at leadership level yet. Unless further escalation occurs in judicial proceedings or a parliamentary censure crystallizes, the more likely case is muddling through. Still, the risk is markedly above historic baseline: base rate (15-20%) plus clear upward pressure from present volatility, so my estimate reflects this risk without being overly extreme, pending the emergence of a 'tipping point' event.

Nevertheless, there is no clear legal avenue for forcing him to call elections until either parliamentary or external pressure hits a breaking point. He has repeatedly and emphatically ruled out early elections, aware that his hold on power is fragile. Historically, minority governments under pressure in Spain do sometimes call early elections, but only after exhausting all other options, and often precipitated by a major new trigger event. Current polling and political commentary suggest mounting, but not yet insurmountable, pressure. Most importantly, to satisfy the fine print, elections must be CALLED by January 1, 2026\u2014a very short window. There is no public evidence that S\u00e1nchez is preparing to do so imminently (indeed, current headlines focus on his insistence on finishing the term).

Critiques of the lowest forecasts (18%) are also valid, highlighting the historically non-linear collapse mechanisms in Latin European parliamentary crises\u2014yet, as several forecasters defend, those tipping events are not currently materializing at a high enough rate to justify extreme risk. My view remains that the opportunity structure is highly stressed but not (yet) at the puncture point for a snap election. In sum: I see no compelling new evidence or arguments to shift my odds meaningfully up or down, so I hold at 33%.",

S\u00e1nchez directly criticized the opposition, particularly the regional presidents of Madrid and Andalusia, asserting that 'there has been no government in the history of the country as parliamentary as the one I lead.' He denounced the opposition as 'destructive,' 'fueled by absurdity,' and 'aligned with the far right,' and also attacked Junts after the party led by Carles Puigdemont announced it would block government initiatives. S\u00e1nchez urged them to reconsider their stance 'for the benefit of the people.' In his rebuttal, People's Party (PP) leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o portrayed S\u00e1nchez as 'entrenched' and 'terrified' of judicial proceedings involving the government, the PSOE, and his family, stating, 'If the case arises, I won't pardon him,' signaling his belief that S\u00e1nchez faces a complex judicial future.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 11:22 AM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2025/11/12/69146c61e9cf4a7c3b8b45c4-video.html)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez to Target PP on Healthcare, Feij\u00f3o to Focus on Corruption in Congress Appearance**\nOn Wednesday, November 12, 2025, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez appeared before the Congress of Deputies for a plenary session, initially requested by himself to report on the recent European Council in Brussels and international summits, but primarily focusing on the management of public services\u2014especially healthcare\u2014to criticize the People's Party (PP). S\u00e1nchez aims to highlight the deterioration in public service management, particularly in regions governed by the PP, such as Andalusia\u2019s ongoing breast cancer screening crisis under Juanma Moreno. In response, opposition leader Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o plans to portray S\u00e1nchez as 'cornered by corruption,' emphasizing the 'unsustainable' situation due to the absence of approved budgets and parliamentary majority. The PP has included several contentious points in the agenda, demanding S\u00e1nchez address his wife Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez\u2019s imputation in five crimes, the judicial investigation into socialist Leire D\u00edez, and the GRECO\u2019s recommendations on corruption prevention. The PP also plans to raise the UCO\u2019s report on Minister \u00c1ngel V\u00edctor Torres and cash payments to PSOE leaders from Ferraz. Additionally, the PP will press S\u00e1nchez on the political fallout from Junts\u2019 decision to break ties with the government, block legislation, and oppose the 2026 state budget. S\u00e1nchez\u2019s government insists it can still advance legislation with Junts\u2019 support, citing the possibility of crafting proposals appealing to the Catalan independence party. The PP, however, argues the situation is 'insustainable' and demands early elections, claiming S\u00e1nchez is 'cornered by corruption' and that the legislature is effectively over. The session coincides with high-profile judicial developments, including the prosecutor general\u2019s testimony in the case against Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso\u2019s partner and ongoing scrutiny of the 'dirty war machine' of the S\u00e1nchez administration, as described by PP officials.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 05:45 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/politica/20251112/sanchez-feijoo-corrupcion-junts-mazon-123623052)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Faces Parliamentary Scrutiny Over Governance Without Majority, Budget Crisis, and Corruption Allegations**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez will appear before the Congress of Deputies on Wednesday to address the outcomes of recent European Councils and respond to urgent demands from the opposition People's Party (PP). The PP is seeking explanations on corruption cases affecting S\u00e1nchez\u2019s government, his family, and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), particularly regarding the judicial investigation into Leire D\u00edez. This appearance comes amid a highly challenging political context: S\u00e1nchez governs without a parliamentary majority after Junts ended its support, lacks approved budgets, and faces ongoing scrutiny due to the leaked audio of a PSOE 'plumber' admitting to being appointed to manage the party\u2019s internal affairs. The PP has registered an urgent request for S\u00e1nchez to clarify how he will ensure governability after the collapse of his investiture majority. Junts\u2019 spokesperson, M\u00edriam Nogueras, declared the legislature 'blocked' and stated her group would oppose all new government legislation, including the Budgets and key reforms like the Bola\u00f1os and Bego\u00f1a laws. Despite this, government sources downplay the threat, noting Junts says it won\u2019t negotiate but may still vote on legislation. The plenary session is a 'macropleno' consolidating multiple urgent requests. S\u00e1nchez will have unlimited speaking time, while opposition parties have 20 minutes for their first reply and 5 for the second. The session coincides with the public declaration of Spain\u2019s Attorney General, \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Ortiz, before the Supreme Court over alleged confidential data leaks. S\u00e1nchez and PSOE leadership have publicly defended Garc\u00eda Ortiz\u2019s innocence, calling the trial baseless, while regional leaders like Emiliano Garc\u00eda-Page have praised the judicial process as 'impeccable.' The session is expected to extend into the afternoon, with the control of government taking place afterward.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 07:34 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/politica/20251111/congreso-obliga-sanchez-explicar-gobernara-sin-mayoria-presupuestos-sombra-corrupcion/1003744009256_0.html)\n\n**Documents Reveal PSOE\u2019s Campaign to Discredit Judge Marchena by Linking Him to Villarejo**\nDocuments obtained by El Confidencial reveal that the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) orchestrated a campaign to discredit Judge Manuel Marchena, former president and current member of the Supreme Court's Penal Chamber, by fabricating allegations of ties to former police commissioner Jos\u00e9 Manuel Villarejo and others, including Rafael Catal\u00e1 and Alfonso Carrascosa, without any supporting evidence. The dossier, prepared between spring and summer 2024 by Leire D\u00edez Castro, Javier P\u00e9rez Dolset, and journalists linked to PSOE\u2019s Ferraz headquarters, relied on intercepted recordings made by Villarejo and speculative claims. These materials were stored on a USB drive handed to PSOE leadership by D\u00edez on June 3, 2024, during her voluntary resignation, and later turned over to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The campaign was part of a broader, year-long effort by the PSOE\u2019s inner circle\u2014led by Santos Cerd\u00e1n\u2014to compile compromising information on judges, prosecutors, police officers, journalists, and businessmen deemed hostile to the government, with the intent to launch smear campaigns. Some of this material surfaced during the April 2024 reflection period following the indictment of Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, and was disseminated through major media outlets to promote the narrative that the judicial investigation was a conspiracy to undermine the prime minister. D\u00edez and P\u00e9rez Dolset are currently under investigation for bribery and influence trafficking, and are scheduled to testify on November 17, 2025. Two prosecutors also accuse them of attempting to bribe officials to obtain information on the Anti-Corruption Chief Prosecutor, Alejandro Luz\u00f3n.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2025-11-11/psoe-marchena-sanchez-fiscal-garcia-ortiz-cloacas-leire_4245045/)\n\n**Garc\u00eda-Page Urges S\u00e1nchez to Prosecute PSOE Figures Accused of Using Party as Money Laundering Tool**\nEmiliano Garc\u00eda-Page, President of Castilla-La Mancha, has called on Pedro S\u00e1nchez and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) leadership to file legal complaints against individuals he alleges used the party as a 'laundry service' to launder dirty money, specifically referencing Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos and Koldo Garc\u00eda. Garc\u00eda-Page echoed reports from El Espa\u00f1ol stating that the PSOE internally suspects \u00c1balos and Koldo of blanching funds through potentially falsified invoices, though Ferraz (the PSOE headquarters) has refused to file a complaint despite claiming the party is the 'victim.' \u00c1balos responded on social media platform X, demanding that PSOE leaders voluntarily disclose all financial records of party members and predecessors from 2017 to 2025. The PSOE\u2019s deputy spokesperson, Emma L\u00f3pez, declined to comment on individual statements, affirming the party acts with transparency and cooperates with judicial authorities, but did not accept \u00c1balos\u2019s challenge to provide documentation. Garc\u00eda-Page reiterated his call for the PSOE to 'build a wall' against corruption\u2014reformulating S\u00e1nchez\u2019s earlier phrase about opposing 'reactionary right-wing' forces\u2014emphasizing that such a wall should also target corrupt figures 'within the Socialist Party itself.' He stated that if evidence confirms the misuse of the party for money laundering, the PSOE must not only file complaints but also distance itself completely. He also demanded legal action against Leire D\u00edez, whom he claimed did not speak on his behalf. This request, made a week prior, remains unaddressed by Ferraz. Garc\u00eda-Page condemned the practice of using the Prime Minister\u2019s name to commit crimes or threaten judges and prosecutors, calling it 'vile and serious,' and insisted that such individuals must face judicial proceedings with a formal complaint from the party. While he expressed that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s re-election bid is normal for a sitting president, he noted the current political climate is complicated due to the 'generalizing environment of corruption.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 01:36 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/politica/20251111/page-pide-sanchez-querelle-usaron-psoe-lavadora-alusion-koldo-abalos/1003744007368_0.html)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Affirms Commitment to 2027, Feij\u00f3o Urges Early Elections**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez defended his government's performance during an extraordinary session of the Congress of Deputies, addressing a fragile parliamentary situation and ongoing corruption cases involving the government, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), and his family circle.

Amid a fragile coalition following Junts' certification of a rupture in the governing majority\u2014coupled with ongoing scandals involving former PSOE officials, including one under trial and another in preventive detention\u2014and revelations from leaked audio of Leire D\u00edez suggesting coordinated efforts by the PSOE to discredit investigators, S\u00e1nchez reaffirmed his commitment to not calling general elections until 2027. He dismissed the need to account for scandals under his leadership in just one minute, instead shifting focus to criticizing regional governments led by the PP. S\u00e1nchez argued that corruption is not only illegal acts like bribery or embezzlement but also includes the privatization and cutting of public services in exchange for political or financial favors\u2014describing this as 'immoral' and damaging to the majority of citizens, even if not strictly illegal. He specifically targeted Andalusian President Juanma Moreno and Madrid President Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, accusing them of dismantling public services. S\u00e1nchez also reiterated his demand for regional elections in the Valencian Community after Carlos Maz\u00f3n's resignation, despite opposing national early elections. He claimed his minority government offers greater stability than past absolute majorities, such as Mariano Rajoy\u2019s, and projected a future in 2027 marked by economic growth, job creation, reduced inequality, normalized relations with Catalonia through the full implementation of the amnesty law, and improved public finances despite crises including pandemics, natural disasters, and a 'destructive' opposition. He accused the PP of 'destructive opposition' aligned with the far right and criticized other parties for blocking key legislation\u2014such as digital protection for minors, family law, and universal healthcare\u2014arguing that such actions undermine the public good. S\u00e1nchez appealed to a 'spirit of agreement' among parliamentary groups, emphasizing that politics must serve citizens regardless of ideology, as the well-being of many depends on legislative outcomes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 10:29 AM\nSource:[El Comercio](https://www.elcomercio.es/politica/sanchez-esgrime-recortes-privatizacion-corrupcion-ataca-moreno-20251112112937-ntrc.html)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez to Target PP on Healthcare, Feij\u00f3o to Focus on Corruption in Congress Appearance**\nOn Wednesday, November 12, 2025, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez appeared before the Congress of Deputies for a plenary session, initially requested by himself to report on the recent European Council in Brussels and international summits, but primarily focusing on the management of public services\u2014especially healthcare\u2014to criticize the People's Party (PP).

In a strategic move to counter the opposition's emphasis on corruption, S\u00e1nchez's government is demanding that PP-led autonomous communities provide data on cancer screening programs and register conscientious objectors to abortion, while also criticizing the handling of public services. The government highlights discrepancies in funding allocation, citing that of 130 billion euros transferred to Madrid between 2019 and 2025, only 45% was used for public healthcare, with significant contracts awarded to private entities like Quir\u00f3n. The strategy targets regional PP leaders such as Isabel D\u00edaz Ayuso, Juanma Moreno, Carlos Maz\u00f3n, and Alfonso Ma\u00f1ueco, aiming to discredit their governance ahead of upcoming regional elections. Key figures in the government, including Minister of Health M\u00f3nica Garc\u00eda-L\u00f3pez and Madrid Socialist leader \u00d3scar L\u00f3pez, are being used to amplify this narrative, with the government asserting that 'Madrid is a national issue.' S\u00e1nchez plans to address both international summits and public service performance in a parliamentary session, while also responding to the PP\u2019s demands to discuss corruption, framing the debate as 'corruption in public services.' Government sources claim this approach is designed to 'put pressure on regional barons' and establish the image that PP leaders lack the capacity to manage public affairs effectively.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 01:13 AM\nSource:[EL MUNDO](https://www.elmundo.es/espana/2025/11/12/69137a95e4d4d887198b457a.html)\n\n**S\u00e1nchez Faces Parliamentary Scrutiny Over Governance Without Majority, Budget Crisis, and Corruption Allegations**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez will appear before the Congress of Deputies on Wednesday to address the outcomes of recent European Councils and respond to urgent demands from the opposition People's Party (PP).

Maz\u00f3n had earlier shown willingness to testify, even waiving the three-day grace period, and had originally proposed the commission in November 2024. While Morant questioned Maz\u00f3n\u2019s statements and suggested they might be subject to judicial review, she made no mention of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s absence. Neither the PSOE nor Comprom\u00eds commented on S\u00e1nchez\u2019s non-attendance, but both parties criticized Maz\u00f3n for his testimony. The contrast between S\u00e1nchez\u2019s refusal to appear and Morant\u2019s active presence in the regional parliament underscores a strategic inconsistency in the government\u2019s stance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 06:21 PM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/comunidad-valenciana/sanchez-rehuye-comision-investigacion-pero-envia-morant-cortes-criticar-mazon-15741894)\n\n**Documents Reveal PSOE\u2019s Campaign to Discredit Judge Marchena by Linking Him to Villarejo**\nDocuments obtained by El Confidencial reveal that the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) orchestrated a campaign to discredit Judge Manuel Marchena, former president and current member of the Supreme Court's Penal Chamber, by fabricating allegations of ties to former police commissioner Jos\u00e9 Manuel Villarejo and others, including Rafael Catal\u00e1 and Alfonso Carrascosa, without any supporting evidence. The dossier, prepared between spring and summer 2024 by Leire D\u00edez Castro, Javier P\u00e9rez Dolset, and journalists linked to PSOE\u2019s Ferraz headquarters, relied on intercepted recordings made by Villarejo and speculative claims. These materials were stored on a USB drive handed to PSOE leadership by D\u00edez on June 3, 2024, during her voluntary resignation, and later turned over to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. The campaign was part of a broader, year-long effort by the PSOE\u2019s inner circle\u2014led by Santos Cerd\u00e1n\u2014to compile compromising information on judges, prosecutors, police officers, journalists, and businessmen deemed hostile to the government, with the intent to launch smear campaigns. Some of this material surfaced during the April 2024 reflection period following the indictment of Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, and was disseminated through major media outlets to promote the narrative that the judicial investigation was a conspiracy to undermine the prime minister. D\u00edez and P\u00e9rez Dolset are currently under investigation for bribery and influence trafficking, and are scheduled to testify on November 17, 2025. Two prosecutors also accuse them of attempting to bribe officials to obtain information on the Anti-Corruption Chief Prosecutor, Alejandro Luz\u00f3n.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2025-11-11/psoe-marchena-sanchez-fiscal-garcia-ortiz-cloacas-leire_4245045/)\n\n**Garc\u00eda-Page Urges S\u00e1nchez to Prosecute PSOE Figures Accused of Using Party as Money Laundering Tool**\nEmiliano Garc\u00eda-Page, President of Castilla-La Mancha, has called on Pedro S\u00e1nchez and the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) leadership to file legal complaints against individuals he alleges used the party as a 'laundry service' to launder dirty money, specifically referencing Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos and Koldo Garc\u00eda. Garc\u00eda-Page echoed reports from El Espa\u00f1ol stating that the PSOE internally suspects \u00c1balos and Koldo of blanching funds through potentially falsified invoices, though Ferraz (the PSOE headquarters) has refused to file a complaint despite claiming the party is the 'victim.' \u00c1balos responded on social media platform X, demanding that PSOE leaders voluntarily disclose all financial records of party members and predecessors from 2017 to 2025. The PSOE\u2019s deputy spokesperson, Emma L\u00f3pez, declined to comment on individual statements, affirming the party acts with transparency and cooperates with judicial authorities, but did not accept \u00c1balos\u2019s challenge to provide documentation. Garc\u00eda-Page reiterated his call for the PSOE to 'build a wall' against corruption\u2014reformulating S\u00e1nchez\u2019s earlier phrase about opposing 'reactionary right-wing' forces\u2014emphasizing that such a wall should also target corrupt figures 'within the Socialist Party itself.' He stated that if evidence confirms the misuse of the party for money laundering, the PSOE must not only file complaints but also distance itself completely. He also demanded legal action against Leire D\u00edez, whom he claimed did not speak on his behalf. This request, made a week prior, remains unaddressed by Ferraz. Garc\u00eda-Page condemned the practice of using the Prime Minister\u2019s name to commit crimes or threaten judges and prosecutors, calling it 'vile and serious,' and insisted that such individuals must face judicial proceedings with a formal complaint from the party. While he expressed that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s re-election bid is normal for a sitting president, he noted the current political climate is complicated due to the 'generalizing environment of corruption.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 01:36 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/espana/politica/20251111/page-pide-sanchez-querelle-usaron-psoe-lavadora-alusion-koldo-abalos/1003744007368_0.html)\n\n**01:30H | November 11, 2025 | Poniendo las Calles**\nJudicial fronts surrounding the Spanish government are advancing, with the trial of the State Attorney General approaching, and his testimony imminent.

The investigation involves former high-ranking members of the Socialist Party (PSOE), including S\u00e1nchez's wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, and his younger brother, David S\u00e1nchez, as well as figures like former Transport Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos and ex-party leader Santos Cerd\u00e1n. The case centers on alleged illegal commissions and contract manipulations in public medical equipment procurement during the Covid-19 pandemic. Koldo Garc\u00eda, a former aide to \u00c1balos, is identified as a central suspect, prompting a police raid on the PSOE headquarters in Madrid and the arrest of Cerd\u00e1n. The opposition, led by the People's Party (PP), alleges that S\u00e1nchez was aware of or involved in the illicit activities. The PP seeks to use the inquiry to push for early legislative elections, previously scheduled for 2027. S\u00e1nchez denies any involvement or knowledge of the irregularities. A police report released in summer 2025 included transcripts of conversations discussing bribes and even prostitution, undermining the government coalition between PSOE and the left-wing Sumar party. Despite mounting pressure, S\u00e1nchez has rejected calls to resign, though he admitted to considering it amid rising political tension. In July 2025, he unveiled an anti-corruption package aimed at restoring alliances with Sumar and nationalist parties, crucial for passing legislation in the minority government.

S\u00e1nchez will be accompanied by his inner circle, including Minister of Justice F\u00e9lix Bola\u00f1os, whose controversial 'Ley Bola\u00f1os' aims to reform the judiciary amid corruption allegations against the PSOE\u2014though it currently lacks parliamentary support. Rafael Simancas, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s close ally and Secretary of State for the Cortes, and Iv\u00e1n Garc\u00eda Yustos, an advisor with a history of controversy\u2014including a 2003 scandal involving calls to erotic lines from a municipal phone\u2014will also be present. Ana Manzano, previously S\u00e1nchez\u2019s top advisor, will join the PSOE leadership as its new Communications Director, reinforcing the fusion between government and party. Despite the gravity of the issues, the government downplays the session, calling it a routine control meeting and dismissing it as potentially becoming a 'circus.' S\u00e1nchez will not present documents disproving the existence of a 'caja B' (off-the-books fund) or provide specific figures on cash payments, leaving transparency concerns unresolved\u2014especially after former PSOE treasurer Mariano Moreno admitted to receiving cash payments before the Supreme Court.

The article demands accountability, stating that the investigations by the UCO, the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the judiciary have uncovered serious crimes, including prevarication, bribery, influence trafficking, misappropriation of public funds, and illegal party financing. The article notes that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, brother, former State Attorney General, two former top PSOE leaders, and numerous high-ranking officials are currently imprisoned, prosecuted, or under investigation. It criticizes the lack of attendance by four of the seven parliamentary groups\u2014Catalan and Basque nationalist parties who were allies in S\u00e1nchez\u2019s investiture\u2014during over 100 prior sessions of the commission, though it anticipates their presence on October 30 to support him. The article claims that only three groups regularly attend: the mixed group, the Socialist group (which defends S\u00e1nchez without questioning), and the Popular Party (PP), which is expected to conduct rigorous questioning. The PP is highlighted as the only force likely to hold S\u00e1nchez accountable, citing over \u20ac2 billion in public funds allegedly misused across multiple scandals, including mask procurement, public works contracts, Air Europa and Plus Ultra rescues, hydrocarbons, and the fake Bego\u00f1a chair.

It references a denunciation by Ignacio Stampa, former anti-corruption prosecutor in Madrid, who claims that PSOE envoys pressured the judiciary to undermine investigations targeting the government. The author argues that this is not merely a plea for leniency but a serious allegation from a senior member of the Public Ministry, suggesting S\u00e1nchez was aware of these pressures. The article portrays the PSOE as a 'machinery of mud' unlike any seen in recent political memory, highlighting the contrast between S\u00e1nchez's image and the actions of figures like Koldo Garc\u00eda, Cerd\u00e1n, and \u00c1balos, who were expelled from the party. The author claims that the denunciation is a serious legal indicator that the judiciary will investigate with urgency, potentially threatening the political and financial stability of regional leaders and allied parties due to the risk to public payroll positions. The piece criticizes media outlets like Telepedro for orchestrating a coordinated response to deflect attention from the scandal, accusing them of discrediting whistleblowers by labeling them as agents of extremism, while dismissing such arguments as illogical and easily repeated by voters.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 01:31 AM\nSource:[Libertad Digital](https://www.libertaddigital.com/opinion/2025-10-22/pablo-molina-a-ver-como-lo-explican-en-telepedro-7310848/)\n\n**Political Turmoil Over Spanish Prime Minister's Senate Appearance Amid Corruption Probe**\nThe upcoming appearance of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez before the Senate on October 30, 2025, has sparked political controversy and raised expectations among analysts. S\u00e1nchez will face questions from opposition senators of the People's Party (PP) regarding the 'Koldo case,' a corruption investigation involving the aide of a former minister. The PP views the session as an opportunity to publicly challenge S\u00e1nchez, pressure him, and demand his resignation and early elections. The PP has maintained secrecy about which senator will lead the questioning, aiming to prevent S\u00e1nchez from preparing anticipated responses. Some television commentators warn that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s performance could backfire if his rising popularity is undermined during the session. Despite this, S\u00e1nchez continues to face persistent criticism from right-leaning media, including scrutiny over investigations involving his wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, and other figures linked to his party, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), such as a former minister and the former secretary of organization.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 11:43 AM\nSource:[Prensa latina](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/10/17/revuelo-por-comparecencia-de-gobernante-espanol-ante-senado/)\n\n**Spain to Use AI to Combat Corruption Amid Political Scandal**\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, leader of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), has committed to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to combat corruption in Spain amid ongoing allegations against his government and inner circle. The Spanish government has approved a transparency initiative that includes publicly disclosing the agendas of senior officials, official travel records, and public entity accounts. The plan also calls for a 'deep transformation' of public procurement through AI-powered automation and advanced data analysis to detect irregular patterns and potential fraud. S\u00e1nchez described AI integration in public contracting as a 'deep and essential change' in how public funds are allocated, emphasizing the need for open, intelligent, and shared oversight. He stated that the initiative aims to restore public trust and counter citizen disillusionment with politics. S\u00e1nchez announced the launch of a new government 'transparency portal' designed to be clearer, more open, and grounded in the right to know, understand, and participate. This move follows investigations into S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife, brother, two former close associates, and the Attorney General, involving allegations of influence trafficking, corruption, and leaking state secrets. Critics claim these overlapping cases indicate a culture of corruption within his administration and argue he should resign, while allies accuse judges and journalists of politically motivated 'lawfare'. The high-profile 'Caso Koldo' investigation, involving two of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s closest allies, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos and Santos Cerd\u00e1n, has intensified political pressure, with Cerd\u00e1n facing potential detention.

Four key challenges\u2014parliamentary gridlock, the autonomous calendar, ongoing corruption investigations, and the Gaza conflict\u2014favor an early election. Despite S\u00e1nchez's personal unpopularity and a weakened government team, especially his first vice-president, the PSOE sees early elections as a strategic necessity to prevent further erosion. The government's attempt to present a budget is seen as a political maneuver to shift blame for legislative stagnation onto opposition parties. Corruption probes against S\u00e1nchez\u2019s inner circle, including his wife, brother, and top allies like \u00c1balos, have intensified, with the UCO revealing extensive misuse of influence and illicit financial channels. The upcoming trial of the Attorney General may further inflame political dynamics. S\u00e1nchez aims to capitalize on the current political chaos, using the early election as a way to reset the political landscape, avoid judicial escalation, and maintain power. The article suggests that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s strategy is to preempt the judicial and political momentum against him, framing the election as a moment of national renewal. The article concludes with a metaphorical call: 'The urn is in sight,' signaling that the political battle is about to escalate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 01:19 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/opinion/carta-del-director/20251005/armada-capitan-sanchez-acerca-urna-vista/1003743955211_20.html)\n\n**The 'Ley Bego\u00f1a' Fails to Prevent the President\u2019s Wife from Facing Corruption Trial**\nThe article explains that the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) proposed the \"ley Bego\u00f1a\", a law intended to protect fundamental rights against abusive judicial actions. The law would have prevented the wife of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez from being close to a trial for corruption, but it has not yet been approved and remains frozen in Congress. The proposal seeks to reform the \"acci\u00f3n popular\" (popular action) by limiting its use to cases where the prosecutor or a private accuser has filed a complaint, thereby preventing political or collective groups from initiating lawsuits without a concrete accusation. The law would also restrict the ability of judges and prosecutors to act during the investigative phase, allowing them to intervene only after the investigation is finished and only if the judge deems the facts potentially criminal. The article quotes the law\u2019s proponents saying, 'Cuando no se formule acusaci\u00f3n por el Ministerio Fiscal o por la acusaci\u00f3n particular el proceso penal ser\u00e1 archivado, no pudiendo continuar el mismo s\u00f3lo con la acusaci\u00f3n formulada por la acusaci\u00f3n popular salvo por delitos en los que concurra un inter\u00e9s exclusivamente p\u00fablico.' It also notes that the law would exclude legal entities, public bodies, political parties, and associated foundations from popular accusations to prevent political manipulation. The piece portrays the law as a tool to curb what it calls \"lawfare\" and to silence judicial criticism of the government, suggesting a politically motivated agenda.

S\u00e1nchez said the investigations, which he described as a \"minority\", cause a \"terrible damage\" to justice. He denied any systemic corruption in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and said he had no \"objective information\" that his wife or associates had committed wrongdoing. The article notes that G\u00f3mez is scheduled to testify on September 11 in a corruption case, and that S\u00e1nchez\u2019s brother is under investigation for embezzlement and tax fraud. It also mentions former PSOE officials Santos Cerd\u00e1n, Jos\u00e9 Luis \u00c1balos, and Koldo Garc\u00eda, who are implicated in bribery and public contract investigations.

This comes at a time when Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is facing a series of corruption scandals involving his entourage and members of his Socialist Party. The Group of States against Corruption (Greco) states that 'there is no determined action and concrete results regarding the recommendations for high-ranking officials of the central government executive'. Although the report acknowledges that 'improvements are proposed' in the framework of a Plan of Action for Democracy and a draft law on administrative transparency, it emphasizes that 'these initiatives remain to be implemented'. The institution denounces that 'no measure has been taken to reform the special procedure of penal responsibility of government members' and that the Bureau of Conflicts of Interest 'is still not truly independent and does not have its own budget'. The Greco demands that the Spanish authorities submit a report on the progress made in implementing its recommendations by June 30, 2026. The government of Pedro Sanchez has welcomed the progress made by the Greco 'in the prevention of corruption' in Spain, without mentioning the criticisms made by the Strasbourg-based institution. Despite this, several judicial investigations are ongoing, targeting close associates of the Prime Minister and leader of the Socialist Workers' Party of Spain (PSOE), Pedro Sanchez.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: August 01, 2025 10:44 AM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/fr/infos/international/corruption-des-hauts-dirigeants-l-espagne-pingl-e-2808615.html)\n\n",

    "summary": "The forecasts regarding whether Pedro S\u00e1nchez will call general elections in Spain before 2026 coalesce around a moderately elevated, but less-than-even, risk of an early election. Most experts agree that the government is in a very precarious state: S\u00e1nchez leads a minority government after losing Junts' support, cannot pass a budget, and several judiciary investigations involving his wife, brother, and close allies are creating ongoing reputational damage. These factors all increase the underlying probability of early elections, as such conditions historically lead to snap elections in Spain and similar parliamentary systems. However, the experts emphasize that S\u00e1nchez has repeatedly and strongly insisted he will not call early elections, and that Spanish law and precedent allow minority governments to survive for extended periods using executive powers and ad hoc deals. Additionally, current polling and party support suggest that S\u00e1nchez and PSOE would likely fare poorly in an early election, further deterring him from calling one unless absolutely forced by a triggering event such as a failed budget, a loss of confidence vote, or severe judicial escalation (e.g., indictments close to S\u00e1nchez). Most forecasters view the status quo as S\u00e1nchez trying to \u2018ride out the storm\u2019 via narrative management and party discipline. The likelihood of an early election rises if either a coalition partner like Sumar quits, judicial proceedings directly implicate or indict S\u00e1nchez or his family, or if a complete budgetary/legislative shutdown occurs. Notably, while base rates since 2015 show a relatively high proportion of truncated legislatures in Spain, the window for calling an election before 2026 is rapidly closing, making last-minute snap calls increasingly unlikely barring sudden shocks. Probability estimates: most experts cluster around the 28-37% range (with one higher outlier at 68%), reflecting genuine risk but recognition of institutional \u2018stickiness\u2019 and personal reluctance. The aggregate expert consensus is that while an early election is plainly plausible given the crisis, it is still less likely than not, absent a new and dramatic escalation.",
