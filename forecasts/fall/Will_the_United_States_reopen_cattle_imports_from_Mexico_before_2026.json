The technical bar now hinges not on eliminating all risk, but on providing enough assurance and documentation for the USDA to justify a re-opening without fear of immediate recrimination if a rare case emerges. On the other hand, the past history of abrupt reversals, explicit statements about not compromising 'at any price,' and the need for thorough verification\u2014all in a highly charged political environment\u2014mean that even small uncertainties may delay action until after the holidays or into early 2026. With less than seven weeks left, a sudden administrative breakthrough is possible but would be unusual for a biosecurity and SPS risk of this magnitude. Overall, the probability of resolution before 2026 should be upgraded from pure base rates (10-20%) due to very recent facility openings, absent cases, and pressure, but is still less than even odds given the tight timeline and prevailing caution.",

The rapid operationalization of the Tampico sterilized fly dispersal facility, good surveillance data (no new cases in over a month north of central Mexico), intense regulatory collaboration, and direct incentives (political and economic) for reopening are strong signals in favor of resumption. However, APHIS protocol is traditionally conservative, especially with high-magnitude biological threats like NWS. Historical risk-adverse behavior around vector-borne livestock pathogens means the default is caution and waiting for robust, sustained evidence of eradication (likely >30, ideally 60\u201390 days), often with ramp-up of new certification/tracing regimes, none of which have been explicitly stated as achieved yet. The critical practical limitation here is time: with ~6 weeks to go and the precedent of prior sudden reclosures, any new incident or administration-level hesitancy would keep the ban in place. Yet the window is just large enough, if data stays clean, for a (likely partial, possibly region-limited or risk-managed) reopening\u2014especially if lobbying intensifies and there are no further NWS detections through early/mid December.

Still, there is no historical precedent for reopening within weeks of border-adjacent NWS detections, and both public and private signals from USDA indicate ongoing risk aversion. The just-launched Tampico facility will need time to show real-world impact; major new US (Texas) and Mexican biocontrol facilities will not be operational until (early) 2026. Essentially, the operational and bureaucratic steps required\u2014certification, surveillance, biocontrol validation, port-of-entry readiness\u2014make meaningful border reopening before January 1, 2026, unlikely. A small, nonzero chance persists if case numbers rapidly drop and political pressure wins out, but the window is much too tight for a routine, risk-averse bureaucracy to clear all hurdles.

News signals suggest substantial progress (new Tampico facility, high-level US-Mexico cooperation, lack of recent northward spread, and aggressive investments into future capacity), but the durable risk aversion at USDA and political signals ('cannot compromise safety,' 'no timeline announced,' 'every tool deployed') point to a bias in favor of caution until domestic US production lines are online. The Trump Administration\u2019s rhetoric has focused on toughness and biosecurity, suggesting no rush unless there is extremely convincing evidence. Given the approximately six-week window and the fact that prior reopening was instantly reversed due to a single case, the hurdle is extremely high for USDA to restart trade in 2025 \u2014 even as every day brings incremental progress.

The historical base rate for reopening after comparable border closures\u2014especially in the face of zoonotic disease risk with multi-billion-dollar downside\u2014suggests that while rapid reopening is possible under commercial pressure, it typically happens only when there is overwhelming evidence the threat is truly contained, or when new countermeasures (like the soon-to-begin Texas fly plant) are operational. With key US facilities not online until 'early 2026', the final weeks of December may be deemed too close to risk premature exposure, especially if there is any ambiguity in disease data.

The U.S. historically prioritizes over-precaution when facing major biosecurity risks, especially so soon after high-profile near-misses. The new Texas facility to double fly production capacity will not be operational until after New Year\u2019s Day, slightly reducing the institutional willingness to rush a decision and face even a modest risk of an NWS incursion into the U.S. The probability of reopening before the end of 2025 is materially higher due to recent facility launches and positive public statements, but the 6-week window is short, institutional caution runs high, and the risk from a single stray case or ambiguous surveillance report is substantial.\n\nGiven all factors, I estimate the chance of U.S. cattle imports from Mexico resuming before Jan 1, 2026, at 35%. This is well above zero due to clear upward momentum, but below even odds because institutional inertia, recent epidemiological setbacks, and the history of regulatory risk-aversion in U.S. biosecurity policy suggest the default remains 'wait until January or later, unless overwhelming evidence of safety emerges.'",

The operational ramp-up of new US-based sterile fly production is also not complete until early 2026, further reducing the incentive to reopen beforehand. The pattern with past quarantines and animal health bans supports a several-months-to-a-year timeline from apparent containment to reopening.

The fact is, new high-output facilities (Texas, Metapa) will not be online before deadline, meaning true operational confidence simply cannot be asserted until 2026.

Even Animal Health/APHIS experts flagged protocol-driven caution as a core drag. The median/mean probability still supports a conservative forecast, and the detailed consensus underscores the improbability of reopening before all new infrastructure, protocol stabilization, and monitoring cycles are fully implemented. There's no strong argument to boost probability from my initial estimate given the timelines and risks. However, the slight lean toward the lower end by some (10-18%) does push me to consider whether recent technical progress is already priced in and perhaps overestimated. Conversely, there is real upward momentum; intense bilateral effort and new containment tools keep a modest but nontrivial chance alive for a late-breaking reopening.

The critiques especially targeting the outlier optimism (e.g., 71% from RiskAnalysisOIE) align tightly with the historic and institutional context I outlined: the base rate of reopening is very low when US animal health authorities face even faint ambiguity. Notably, every major domain (trade policy, animal health regulation, border inspection, international relations, agricultural economics, supply chain) continues to stress the high likelihood of institutional caution prevailing through the end of 2025. No one advanced a robust argument or new evidence justifying an upward revision. If anything, consensus skepticism about a rapid policy shift strengthens my confidence in my Phase I forecast. Recent technical advances and public optimism nudge the probability above zero, but the short timeframe, political optics, holiday period, and the lack of operational redundancy (i.e., Texas facility still pending) make rapid reopening exceedingly improbable.",

Nearly every knowledgeable forecaster outside of technical vet risk is converging around the same core logic: bureaucratic inertia and risk aversion at the USDA/APHIS, base rates for animal disease ban reversals, and the high political downside risk all dominate. No one credibly disputed that urgency and economic pressure help\u2014but not enough to overcome a holiday-season decision window, recent history of 'snapback' closures, explicit rhetoric from USDA about prioritizing safety, and the fact that new production capacity (Texas plant) won\u2019t be online until after the deadline. If anything, the collective forecasting consensus is less bullish than my own initial low-probability estimate, with most well-argued probabilities clustered from 10-35% and strong critiques of more optimistic outliers. I see no evidence or argument that would justify raising my probability. Indeed, I am inclined to maintain or even slightly lower it, but given the possibility of sudden political override under severe beef price pressure, will hold at 12%.",

NWS flies are parasitic insects that lay eggs in wounds or bodily orifices of warm-blooded animals; upon hatching, the larvae burrow into the tissue and feed on living flesh, causing severe tissue damage and often leading to the death of the host animal. A single female NWS fly can lay up to 3,000 eggs in her lifetime, making infestations highly destructive to livestock. The facility will release sterile male flies to disrupt reproduction and reduce the population of harmful NWS flies, thereby protecting U.S. agricultural interests. The announcement was made in a USDA statement released on November 14, 2025, by The Epoch Times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 05:19 PM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/usda-opens-mexican-facility-for-controlling-spread-of-flesh-eating-new-world-screwworm-5944755)\n\n**USDA confirms new sterile fly facility in Northern Mexico**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on November 13, 2025, the opening of a sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico, as part of its efforts to prevent the spread of New World screwworm (NWS) into the United States. The Tampico facility enables aerial dispersal of sterile flies across northeastern Mexico, including Nuevo Le\u00f3n, enhancing the USDA\u2019s ability to respond quickly to outbreaks. US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins stated the facility is a critical tool in the fight against screwworm, emphasizing its role in pushing the pest southward. The USDA is implementing a five-pronged strategy with Mexico, including aerial dispersal and ground release chambers. Aerial operations are preferred for large-scale, hard-to-reach areas, while ground chambers allow rapid deployment outside facility range. The USDA currently releases 100 million sterile flies per week in Mexico, but aerial dispersal had previously been limited to southern Mexico. Although new NWS cases have been confirmed in southern Mexico, there has been no significant northward spread; the two most northern detections were in Nuevo Le\u00f3n on September 20 and October 5, 2025, in cattle from Chiapas, both inactive with no further detections. The USDA is transitioning from ground release chambers to aerial dispersal in Nuevo Le\u00f3n. Sterile flies are produced at the COPEG facility in Panama, and the USDA is investing $21 million to help Mexico renovate a fruit fly facility in Metapa, which will double NWS production capacity once completed\u2014expected to begin operations by summer 2026. Additionally, the USDA plans a $750 million investment to build the first domestic sterile NWS fly production facility at Moore Air Base in Edinburg, Texas, projected to be operational by early 2026. APHIS is also expediting construction of a sterile fly facility in Southern Texas with a target capacity of 300 million sterile flies per week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[meatpoultry.com](https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/32742-usda-confirms-news-sterile-fly-facility-in-northern-mexico)\n\n**USDA launches new weapon against screwworm in Mexico**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced the opening of a sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico, on November 13, 2025, marking a key advancement in the fight against New World screwworm (NWS). The facility enables aerial dispersal of sterile flies across northeastern Mexico, including Nuevo Le\u00f3n, improving response flexibility and speed. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L.

The USDA has been releasing 100 million sterile flies weekly in Mexico, but prior to this facility, aerial operations were limited to southern Mexico, requiring ground release chambers in northern regions. The Tampico facility will now allow a transition from ground to aerial dispersal in areas like Nuevo Le\u00f3n, where two NWS cases were detected in September and October 2025 in cattle from Chiapas\u2014neither active at the time of reporting.

This effort is part of broader efforts to protect cattle health, as highlighted by multiple recent reports. The University of Missouri Extension reported that anaplasmosis has spread to 48 counties in Missouri, with ongoing research into diagnosis, prevention, and management strategies. Auburn University is targeting horn flies, while Kansas State University and other institutions are addressing new tick species in Kansas, parasite control, and bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Rutgers University is investigating an invasive tick threat, and the FDA has approved gamithromycin for BRD treatment. Additionally, Seek Labs' BioSeeker now detects foot-and-mouth disease, and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration has approved a new vaccine targeting respiratory and reproductive pathogens. The Montana Department of Agriculture confirmed a brucellosis case in a cowherd, and research continues on disease transmission via mosquito preferences and anemia symptoms in adult cows. These developments underscore a coordinated, multi-institutional focus on cattle disease prevention and control across the United States and Mexico.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[beefmagazine.com](https://www.beefmagazine.com/livestock-management/cattle-disease)\n\n**TCFA Participates in USDA-Led Agribusiness Trade Mission to Mexico**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Foreign Agricultural Service led an agribusiness trade mission to Mexico City, Mexico, from November 10\u201314, 2025, with over 150 U.S. exporters, agriculture trade organizations, and USDA officials participating. The mission aimed to strengthen export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses, supporting rural prosperity and global competitiveness. Mexico remains a key trade partner, especially for U.S. cattle imports and beef exports. TCFA representatives\u2014Past Chairman Robby Kirkland, Board Member Alvaro Bustillos, and President & CEO Ben Weinheimer\u2014attended meetings, events, and site visits. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized that U.S. exports to Mexico have grown by 57% since the USMCA took effect in 2020, totaling over $120 billion in additional trade. She highlighted ongoing cooperation with Mexico to combat the New World Screwworm (NWS), stating that the U.S. has been more aggressive than any previous administration in addressing the issue. Rollins also noted progress toward reopening U.S. ports, though no timeline was announced, and affirmed the need for thorough verification and coordination with top officials, including President Trump. Kirkland reported that meetings with Mexico\u2019s Secretary of Agriculture Dr. Julio A. Berdegu\u00e9 Sacrist\u00e1n, SENASICA (the country\u2019s animal health agency), CNOG (National Confederation of Livestock Organizations), UGRCH (Chihuahua Cattlemen\u2019s Association), and the American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico revealed Mexico\u2019s advanced, technology-driven NWS control efforts, including a real-time monitoring center with over 1,000 employees nationwide. Rollins met with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, and in a Reuters interview, she stated that while ports are not yet open, progress is being made daily and every tool is being deployed to ensure safety.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[feedlotmagazine.com](https://www.feedlotmagazine.com/news/beef_news/tcfa-participates-in-usda-led-agribusiness-trade-mission-to-mexico/article_fa96e94c-2ecc-484d-b9ae-5bbb5456bb77.html)\n\n**Cattle markets retreat amid import uncertainty**\nCattle markets retreated last week amid uncertainty over beef imports and trade policy. Nearby live cattle closed at $221.35 per hundredweight, a 6.4% drop, while feeder cattle finished at $326.40, down 3.7%. The selloff occurred without the CFTC Commitments of Traders report, adding to market ambiguity. Although fundamentals have not shifted dramatically since July\u2014when feeder cattle rose $50 and live cattle $25 per hundredweight\u2014this rally may have been overdone. Potential factors include Argentine beef import volumes, possible tariff relaxation on Brazilian beef, and the prospect of reopening the U.S.-Mexico border to Mexican cattle. President Trump\u2019s rhetoric on high beef prices may also be influencing market psychology. However, the primary driver appears to be managed money avoiding uncertainty, with a likely 'RESET' in positioning. Cash markets remained relatively stable: $230 per hundredweight in the North and $232 in the South, though $3\u2013$4 lower than the previous week. December live cattle ended at $221, down from a peak of $248 in mid-October, while cash prices only reached $240\u2013$241. Technical analysis shows large downside gaps on daily charts, with no breach of the prior week\u2019s gap, indicating a weak market structure. Few traders are willing to go long until clarity returns. The author concludes that while money flow and technicals can override fundamentals in the short term, fundamentals will prevail long-term.

Government interventions in 2025\u2014specifically the closure of the Mexican border and imposition of high tariffs on imported beef\u2014intensified the market's upward pressure. Despite ongoing factors such as consumer willingness to pay higher prices and persistent drought, recent government actions suggest a potential reversal of prior interventions, which may lead to a return of feeder cattle prices to around $241.00, as indicated by the CME feeder cattle index. The decline is expected to be gradual, possibly taking until November 2026 to fully materialize. The author projects downside retracement levels and evaluates which futures contract months are most likely to reach these targets. Volatility is anticipated due to unresolved uncertainties and unpredictable actions by the Trump administration. Input costs remain elevated: diesel fuel prices surged above June highs within three weeks, corn prices rose unexpectedly despite abundant supply, soybeans continue climbing, and wheat shows early upward momentum, with a recommendation to consider buying July Chicago or Kansas City wheat. Interest rates remain high and stagnant, with government stimulus efforts\u2014such as increased payroll and potential cash payouts\u2014likely to hinder rate cuts and possibly fuel short-term inflation. The article notes a rise in credit card delinquencies, higher than any previous year, particularly exacerbated by holiday spending in early 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 14, 2025 04:22 PM\nSource:[Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36128580/shootin-the-bull-about-strangleholds)\n\n**USDA confirms new sterile fly facility in Northern Mexico**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced on November 13, 2025, the opening of a sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico, as part of its efforts to prevent the spread of New World screwworm (NWS) into the United States.

He cited record-high beef prices nationwide expected to persist into 2026 and the lowest U.S. cattle herd inventory since 1951. In response, Julie Anna Potts, president and CEO of the Meat Institute, stated that beef packers have been operating at a loss due to record-high cattle prices and tight supply, despite elevated consumer prices. She emphasized that the beef industry is heavily regulated, transactions are transparent, and USDA data confirms ongoing losses projected through 2026. The Meat Institute welcomed a fact-based discussion on beef affordability. R-CALF USA, represented by CEO Bill Bullard, supported the DOJ investigation, arguing there is a longstanding disconnect between cattle and beef prices, which indicates market failure, and called for a competitive market to ensure fair prices for producers and consumers. The National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef Association (NCBA) cautioned in October that market manipulation efforts risk harming American cattlemen without significantly lowering consumer prices. A new USDA cattle plan was introduced by Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins in response to Trump\u2019s earlier comments about increased beef imports from Argentina.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[meatpoultry.com](https://www.meatpoultry.com/articles/32724-president-trump-calls-for-doj-investigation-into-meatpacking-plants)\n\n**Exclusive-US Not Ready to Lift Mexican Cattle Ban Over Screwworm, Agriculture Secretary Rollins Says**\nU.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins stated on November 4, 2025, during an exclusive interview in Mexico City, that the United States is not yet ready to lift the ban on Mexican cattle imports due to an ongoing outbreak of the flesh-eating New World screwworm parasite. Although President Donald Trump is focused on reopening the border\u2014closed since May\u2014Rollins emphasized that the U.S. must ensure complete confidence in containment efforts before lifting restrictions. She praised Mexico\u2019s improved cooperation, calling it 'the most collaborative effort, perhaps in our lifetime, between the two different departments of agriculture,' and noted that 11 screwworm cases in Mexican border states have been contained. Rollins highlighted that the parasite, which lays eggs in wounds and whose larvae consume living tissue, has not yet crossed into the U.S., but poses a significant threat, with potential damages to Texas' economy estimated at $1.8 billion. She acknowledged that illegal cattle trafficking, involving forged documents and stolen livestock from Central America, remains a major concern, though Mexico has strengthened checkpoints and protections. Despite about 250,000 cattle waiting to enter the U.S. and rising beef prices, Rollins insisted that safety is paramount, stating, 'We can never compromise the safety of the herd for the cost,' and that premature reopening could lead to far greater long-term economic damage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Medscape](https://www.medscape.com/s/viewarticle/exclusive-us-not-ready-lift-mexican-cattle-ban-over-2025a1000ubl)\n\n**Mexico boosts controls on cattle after new screwworm case found near US border in Nuevo Leon**\nMexico activated emergency controls on Monday after a new case of the New World screwworm was detected in cattle in the town of Sabinas Hidalgo, Nuevo\u202fLeon, the closest case to the U.S. border since the outbreak began last year. The animal, which came from Veracruz, was identified by the National Health for Food Safety and Food Quality Service. The parasite, a larva of the fly Cochliomyia hominivorax, attacks warm\u2011blooded animals, including humans. Mexico has reported more than 500 active cases in cattle across southern states, and the block on cattle imports has caused the government and ranchers to seek lifting the ban, which could cost the ranching federation up to $400\u202fmillion if it remains in place through the year.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke\u202fRollins said Washington will take \"decisive measures to protect our borders, even in the absence of cooperation\" and that imports of Mexican cattle, bison and horses will remain suspended. \"We will not rely on Mexico to defend our industry, our food supply or our way of life,\" she added.

Despite the end of peak grilling season, ground beef prices remain historically elevated due to tight cattle supplies and strong demand. Danyelle Chinn, research analyst at the University of Missouri Rural and Farm Finance Policy Analysis Center (RaFF), noted that while high prices signal positive conditions for cattle producers, consumers are bearing the financial impact. The root causes include multiple years of drought, which reduced forage and hay availability, forcing producers to cull herds and reduce heifer retention. As a result, current beef cow numbers are the lowest since 1961. Additionally, the USDA closed the border to cattle imports from Mexico due to the northward spread of New World screwworms, further reducing supply. Feedlots in the southern U.S. rely on Mexican cattle, so the import ban has tightened the domestic supply. High input costs have also limited herd expansion. Despite rising prices, demand remains strong\u2014driven by summer grilling and high-protein consumer trends\u2014creating a 'perfect storm' of limited supply and robust demand. Tucker from MU Extension stated that rebuilding the herd will take years, meaning short-term prices may rise further. A potential drop in prices could only occur with increased supply or reduced demand, such as from an economic downturn causing consumers to switch to cheaper proteins. For now, consumers face continued high costs at the meat counter.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[feedlotmagazine.com](https://www.feedlotmagazine.com/news/marketing/beef-prices-remain-high/article_b160c8ce-32c5-4a5a-8daa-ece85517ab74.html)\n\n**Santa Teresa Cattle Crossing to Remain Closed Due to New World Screw-worm Parasite Detection**\nThe Santa Teresa cattle crossing, the largest in the US-Mexico border, will not reopen on July 21 as planned due to the detection of an additional case of the New World Screw-worm parasite in Mexico. The crossing has been closed since May 11 after the US Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, announced the immediate suspension of live cattle, horse, and bison imports from the US following the detection of the parasite in southern Mexico. The USDA had published a plan in July to reopen the crossing in stages, but new cases were detected in northern Mexico, forcing the closure of all crossings. The Secretary of Agriculture for the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, Jeff Witte, stated that the impact of the continued closure on New Mexico's agriculture is small but has significant implications for the national beef industry. 'The majority of cattle that enter through Santa Teresa end up in feedlots or pastures in other states, destined for places like Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska,' Witte said. 'At some point, there were trucks from 17 different states picking up cattle.' The movement of the parasite, previously eradicated from the US for decades, has disrupted international cattle trade through New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. The USDA has announced the construction of a $8.5 million facility to breed sterilized flies to prevent further reproduction in the wild, located in the Moore Air Base in Mission, Texas, and $21 million to produce more sterile flies in a facility in Metapa, Mexico. The USDA also stated that it will increase monitoring and data exchange with Mexican officials along the border. However, Mexican agricultural agents detected a new case in Veracruz, 370 miles from the border, on July 7, forcing the USDA to cancel the reopening plan. 'The US has promised to be vigilant -- and after detecting this new case of NWS, we are pausing the planned reopening of the port to quarantine more and attack this deadly plague in Mexico,' Rollins said in a written statement on July 9. 'We must see additional progress in combating NWS in Veracruz and other nearby Mexican states to reopen cattle ports along the southern border.' Daniel Manzanares, the director of the Santa Teresa international crossing, stated that the USDA has not said when the reopening will occur. The crossing is privately owned by the Cooperativa Uni\u00f3n Ganadera Regional de Chihuahua, which often moves cattle from northern Mexico to feedlots in the US. The plague has not been detected in the northern part of Mexico, but cattle still cannot cross. In previous years, approximately 270,000 animals would have crossed the border by now, said Manzanares. This year, with the closures, only a third, or 74,000, have made it across, requiring the layoffs of half of the workers hired to transport cattle. 'It has severely impacted all types of industry here below, from truckers to buyers, cattle runners, we've laid off employees who won't return,' said Manzanares. 'It's simply breaking a lot of people'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: July 21, 2025 11:57 AM\nSource:[El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez](https://diario.mx/el-paso/2025/jul/20/reapertura-al-cruce-de-ganado-por-santa-teresa-tendra-que-esperar-1076355.html)\n\n**US-Mexico Border Reopens for Cattle Imports after New World Screwworm Scare**\nThe US-Mexico border has reopened for cattle imports after a new world screwworm scare. US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that 'key progress' had been made in controlling the pest, with over 100 million sterile flies being dispersed weekly and no northward spread in eight weeks. The US had restricted Mexican cattle shipments in November after the detection of the pest, but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place. However, after an 'unacceptable northward advancement' of the screwworm, the ban was reinstated in May. Mexico Agriculture and Rural Development Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said that the border opening would begin on July 7. The US plans to create 'fly factories' to produce sterile flies to fight the pest, with a new facility expected to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. The USDA expects to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 19, 2025 11:00 PM\nSource:[legalinsurrection.com](https://legalinsurrection.com/2025/07/us-mexico-border-reopens-for-cattle-imports-after-new-world-screwworm-scare/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across expert domains, the consensus is that reopening U.S. cattle imports from Mexico before January 1, 2026 is unlikely, though opinion is divided by degrees of optimism. Most experts note recent technical and cooperative progress\u2014especially the operationalization of a new sterile fly dispersal facility in Tampico, Mexico, and no new cases of New World screwworm near the border since early October 2025\u2014as factors that increase the possibility of reopening. Economic pressures (including record high beef prices and lobbying from industry on both sides of the border), significant bilateral collaboration, and public statements recognizing Mexico's containment efforts are also widely acknowledged advantages.\n\nHowever, nearly all forecasters highlight strong headwinds: bureaucratic and political risk aversion in the U.S., the requirement for sustained periods of negative surveillance (often 30\u201390 days or more in practice), and explicit statements from USDA and Secretary Rollins about needing 'total confidence' before resuming trade. The regulatory norm for animal disease outbreaks is a slow, highly cautious reopening process, rarely achieved within a few weeks of apparent control\u2014historical base rates show bans often last several months to over a year. Several experts underscore that key U.S. biocontrol infrastructure upgrades (like the Moore Air Base sterile fly facility) will not be online until early 2026, reinforcing incentives to postpone border reopening until those systems are operational.\n\nBest-case Yes scenarios involve continued absence of NWS cases near the border, convincing real-time surveillance, and enough political and economic urgency to overcome administrative inertia\u2014potentially leading to a pilot or phased reopening in late December. No scenarios, considered more probable by most, involve the USDA holding out for a longer interval of confirmed freedom, possibly until the new U.S. facility starts operation or sufficient 'epidemiological cycles' have passed without incident.\n\nProbabilities offered by experts reflect this ambivalence: most cluster in the 10\u201335% range (with outliers at 58% and 71%, though these still emphasize high uncertainty and risk), and group chat consensus gravitates toward reopening as moderately unlikely but not impossible. The majority expectation is for imports to remain suspended through December, with a possible policy shift in early 2026 if the current positive trends are sustained and no new outbreaks occur.",
