Models must always allow for biological and surveillance uncertainty, however slim.

The original question opened on 2024-12-13 17:30:00 and can be found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/30960). This question will resolve to the same value as the synced question. The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nAs of December 11, 2024, CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) 58 human cases in the US for 2024 year-to-date. The page presents exposure sources for the cases, attributing 35 to cattle, 21 to poultry, and two to unknown causes. CDC [describes](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/reported-human-infections.html) H5N1 infections in humans as follows:\n\n> HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 925 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997, including 20 cases and 7 deaths in Hong Kong during 1997-2003, and more than 900 cases reported in 24 countries since November 2003. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported. The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. [Total case counts](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html) reported since 1997 are available.\n\nThe spread of H5 avian influenza among birds and cattle and its spread to humans has [raised concerns](https://www.today.com/health/disease/bird-flu-pandemic-rcna183174) that it could turn into another pandemic. However, as of December 11, 2024, CDC's [summary of the current situation](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) states the following:\n\n> * Person-to-person spread: None\n> * Current public health risk: Low\n\nHistorically during outbreaks, CDC has used a case classification system to identify cases as confirmed, probable, or suspected. For example, see the [case classifications used for the mpox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html). Speaking generally, a confirmed case is one which is confirmed via laboratory testing, a probable case is one without reason to believe the symptoms may be caused by another disease coupled with some detected biological evidence, and a suspected case is one that exhibits comparable symptoms or has high clinical suspicion of being the disease in question.\n\nA genetic analysis of H5N1 published December 5, 2024 [found](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180) that a single mutation is all that is required for the virus to switch its [binding specificity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5605752/) from avian to human:\n\n> A single glutamine to leucine mutation at residue 226 of the virus hemagglutinin was sufficient to enact the change from avian to human specificity. In nature, the occurrence of this single mutation could be an indicator of human pandemic risk.\n\nSee also ScienceDaily: [Scientists identify mutation that could facilitate H5N1 'bird flu' virus infection and potential transmission in humans](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/12/241205142418.htm)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":30960,\"question_id\":30732}}`",

The outbreak, which has seen 688 reported cases so far\u2014up from 189 at the same time last year\u2014has led 15 of the EU\u2019s 27 member states to report farm outbreaks this season. France, Britain, the Netherlands, and Belgium have all implemented similar restrictions, with France having culled over 20 million birds in 2021-22. Germany remains the worst-hit country, reporting 58 outbreaks since August, compared to eight in the same period the previous year. Poland, the EU\u2019s largest poultry producer, has 15 outbreaks but has not mandated confinement. Media reports indicate approximately one million birds have been culled. Nigel Sweetnam, chair of the Irish Farmers' Association National Poultry Committee, stated, 'The whole pattern of bird flu is changing,' calling the situation 'very, very worrying.' The spread of bird flu has also reached US dairy cows, raising concerns over food supply chains, food prices, and potential human transmission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 09:28 PM\nSource:[The Express Tribune](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2576086/europe-locks-down-poultry-as-bird-flu-spreads)\n\n**Bird Flu Returns to Japan: Over 600,000 Chickens Infected, Government Issues Warning**\nJapan is facing a severe outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), with over 600,000 chickens confirmed infected, including a major case in Tainai, Niigata Prefecture, where 630,000 birds are to be culled to prevent further spread. The outbreak marks the third case this season, following earlier incidents in Sapporo and Eniwa, Hokkaido. Authorities confirmed the virus after observing abnormal mortality rates on Monday, with ongoing genetic analysis to assess the virus's strain and transmission potential. HPAI is highly contagious among birds, often causing high mortality, and can occasionally infect humans and other animals. The outbreak has raised serious concerns for Japan\u2019s poultry industry, food security, and economic stability, as companies face culling, transportation bans, and disrupted supply chains. This follows global trends of H5 virus outbreaks impacting poultry, eggs, and livelihoods worldwide.

In Germany, authorities ordered the culling of approximately 130,000 ducks and chickens near Berlin, citing an 'elevated' risk. Denmark reported 150,000 poultry deaths in commercial farms, and the Netherlands culled over 70,000 animals. The virus primarily spreads among wild birds, including cranes, which were previously unaffected. German authorities have established surveillance zones, mandated keeping poultry indoors, and advised the public to avoid contact with sick or dead birds. Switzerland and Finland have strengthened monitoring efforts: Finland allows voluntary vaccination against avian influenza, while Bern has pre-ordered vaccines for high-risk groups such as farmers and veterinarians. The H5N1 virus, known for decades for its avian impact, has recently demonstrated increased adaptability, infecting mammals including domestic cats and cattle, and occasionally humans. Globally, over 900 human cases have been recorded since 2003, with nearly half resulting in fatalities, though the current outbreak appears less lethal than in the past.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 02:38 PM\nSource:[Il Sole 24 ORE](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/influenza-aviaria-cosa-sappiamo-e-dove-sono-focolai-italia-AHNLqgXD)\n\n**Health Warnings Issued Over Escalating Avian Influenza Outbreak in the United States**\nHealth warnings have been issued in the United States due to a growing outbreak of avian influenza, according to a report by the British Daily Mail. The H5N1 virus, which has infected hundreds of people, has resurged after a period of quiet during the summer, causing over 7 million bird deaths on U.S. farms since September, including 1.3 million turkeys, threatening a significant shortage in the holiday season market. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) show that 33 states reported H5N1 infections in wild birds in the past month, with Michigan leading at 54 infected flocks, followed by Minnesota, Colorado, and Kansas. Cases have also been detected in dairy cows in Idaho, Nebraska, and Texas. Due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) faces difficulties in issuing updated data, making the true extent of the outbreak unclear. The USDA plans to use emergency funds to enhance surveillance, while the CDC maintains only a limited number of staff to monitor developments. Human symptoms range from conjunctivitis and mild fever to severe cases involving pneumonia, organ failure, and encephalitis. Dr. Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, stated that H5N1 has settled into a seasonal pattern, calling it 'the new normal.' The USDA also warned of additional bacterial risks in turkey meat, such as Salmonella and E. coli, and urged thorough cooking to eliminate any remaining pathogens or viruses.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 10:53 AM\nSource:[cairo24.com](https://www.cairo24.com/2312064)\n\n**Japan confirms season's third bird flu outbreak**\nA Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak has been confirmed at a poultry farm in Tainai, Niigata Prefecture, Japan, according to local authorities. The outbreak, reported on November 4, 2025, followed an increase in chicken deaths at the farm, with a preliminary virus test returning positive results and a detailed genetic analysis underway. The prefectural government confirmed that 630,000 egg-laying chickens will be culled to contain the spread. This marks the third HPAI outbreak in Japan this season, following cases in Shiraoi, Hokkaido (October 22, 2025) and Eniwa, Hokkaido (November 2, 2025). HPAI is a highly contagious, transboundary disease with zoonotic potential, causing high mortality in both wild and domestic birds and posing risks to human health. It has already led to significant economic losses, including egg shortages and disruptions in poultry trade, and has infected mammals such as cats, cattle, foxes, and seals. Human cases, though rare, have occurred in individuals with close contact with infected poultry or environments. The ongoing outbreaks underscore the urgent need for improved control measures to prevent spillover and potential pandemic emergence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[The Hans India](https://www.thehansindia.com/news/international/japan-confirms-seasons-third-bird-flu-outbreak-1020397)\n\n**Europe locks down poultry as bird flu spreads**\nA surge in highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) cases across Europe has prompted widespread poultry confinement measures, with Ireland imposing nationwide indoor housing for all poultry after confirming its first outbreak in three years.

Since the beginning of September, 7 million farmed birds have been infected nationwide, including 1.3 million turkeys, raising concerns about potential shortages ahead of Thanksgiving. The virus has spread across 33 states, with Michigan reporting the highest number of wild bird detections (54 flocks), followed by Minnesota (19), Colorado (17), and Kansas (16). Outbreaks have also been identified in dairy cows in Idaho, Nebraska, and Texas. Human cases have totaled 70 since last year, with one death reported in January involving an older adult with underlying health conditions. Most cases involved direct exposure to infected birds or cattle, though a Missouri patient was infected without known exposure, highlighting uncertainty in transmission pathways. The CDC\u2019s data tracking is delayed due to the government shutdown, but essential staff remain on duty. The USDA is using emergency funds for surveillance. While the virus can be transmitted through undercooked poultry or unpasteurized dairy, proper cooking (to 165\u00b0F) and pasteurization typically kill it. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Symptoms in humans include conjunctivitis, fever, cough, and fatigue, with rare severe outcomes like pneumonia and brain inflammation. Experts, including Richard Webby of St Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital, say H5N1 has settled into a seasonal pattern, suggesting it will remain a persistent public health concern. Additionally, Thanksgiving turkeys may carry bacteria like salmonella and E. coli, which are eliminated by thorough cooking. Wholesale turkey prices are already 40% higher than last year, according to Bernt Nelson of the American Farm Bureau Federation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 03, 2025 10:38 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15254121/highly-contagious-bird-flu-food-safety-thanksgiving.html)\n\n**Review: Human H5N1 avian flu cases can be asymptomatic, and the virus likely spreads among people**\nA scoping review by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), published in JAMA Network Open on October 29, 2025, reveals that asymptomatic human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) occur and that person-to-person transmission is likely in certain settings. The study analyzed data from 10 reports identifying 18 asymptomatic H5N1 cases, including 2 with molecular and serologic confirmation (MSC) and 16 with molecular confirmation alone (MC). Two MSC cases were identified in adults in Pakistan and Vietnam through household contact investigations; one had exposure to infected poultry, while the other likely contracted the virus through human-to-human transmission, with no poultry contact. Of the 16 MC cases, 11 were found through enhanced surveillance of poultry-exposed individuals (8 in Bangladesh, 2 in Spain, 1 in the UK), and 5 were identified via contact tracing (3 in Vietnam, 2 in Cambodia). The authors emphasize the need for robust data collection from asymptomatic individuals to inform public health responses. In a related commentary, Rick Bright and Nicole Lurie note that since March 2024, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b has spread among dairy cattle, with over 800 infected herds in at least 16 US states. As of mid-2025, approximately 70 human cases have been reported, mostly mild, with at least one death. High viral loads have been detected in raw milk, and live virus has been found in mammary tissue and milking equipment. Spillover to other mammals\u2014including cats, dogs, mice, wild carnivores, marine mammals, and swine\u2014has been documented. The authors challenge the traditional view that H5N1 infections in humans are always severe and that human-to-human transmission does not occur, calling attention to a critical gap in surveillance systems that focus on symptomatic illness rather than infection detection, and stressing the importance of investigating clusters for potential limited transmission.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 07:16 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/review-human-h5n1-avian-flu-cases-can-be-asymptomatic-and-virus-likely)\n\n**Video: Avian Influenza: Answers to the Most Important Questions About the New Disease**\nThe avian influenza (bird flu) has emerged as a new public health concern following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primarily affecting birds, the disease has now spread to other animals including cats and cows, and in rare cases, humans. The Robert Koch Institute confirms over 2,600 human cases worldwide since 2003, with the H5N1 variant causing particular concern; however, no human-to-human transmission has been documented. H5N1 cases are currently reported in Asia and the Americas, with outbreaks among dairy cows in the United States since March 2024. The virus has not yet been detected in Europe, but there is a potential risk of introduction via trade in cattle or beef products. Transmission occurs mainly through raw milk, not airborne routes. The risk to people working with animals is considered low to moderate. Symptoms include fever, cough, breathing difficulties, and in severe cases, pneumonia; gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting may also occur. Finland plans a vaccination campaign for high-risk groups, while Germany is not participating in the EU\u2019s vaccine procurement. Prevention includes consuming only pasteurized milk and thoroughly cooking meat. Treatment involves antiviral medications such as baloxavir, oseltamivir, or zanamivir, as antibiotics are ineffective against viral infections, according to the Science Media Center.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[RP Online](https://rp-online.de/leben/gesundheit/vogelgrippe-antworten-auf-die-wichtigsten-fragen-zur-neuen-krankheit_vid-117390457)\n\n**H9N2 Avian Influenza: Rising Human Infection Risk Sparks Pandemic Warning**\nThe H9N2 avian influenza virus, previously considered a mild 'common cold-level' infection, is now being warned as a potential pandemic threat due to increased human cell adaptability and infection capability. According to a study led by Professor Kelvin To from the University of Hong Kong and published in the international journal Nature on October 27, 2025, the H9N2 virus has undergone genetic changes that allow it to bind more effectively to human respiratory cells compared to the 1999 strain. While no human-to-human transmission cases have been reported, researchers believe the virus is in an early stage of adapting to humans. The study, published in 'Emerging Microbes & Infections' on October 16, 2025, and presented at the Pandemic Research Consortium International Symposium in Melbourne on October 27, highlights concerns that H9N2's low pathogenicity classification allows countries to not report cases internationally, increasing the risk of unnoticed spread. Additionally, Michelle Wille from the Doherty Institute in Melbourne warns that H9N2 infections may be underdiagnosed because they cause mild symptoms and are often overlooked in testing that focuses primarily on the more lethal H5N1 strain. The study cautions that co-infection in animals could lead to genetic recombination and the emergence of new, more dangerous variants.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 01:30 AM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/science-chosun/science/2025/10/29/RBHD6WCMWFFKNHAYFJ7LQFDFDA/)\n\n**H5N1 Avian Flu Ravages the U.S. as Federal Government Shutdown Undermines Public Health Response**\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has spread across the United States, affecting over 1,761 commercial and backyard poultry farms in nearly 50 states by early 2024, with a significant shift in 2024 when it began infecting dairy cattle across 18 states and 976 farms by July 2025. This marked the first widespread mammalian transmission, leading to 70 confirmed human cases by May 2025\u2014up from just one in 2022\u2014with 41 linked to contact with infected cows and 24 to poultry farms. Despite the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stating the public health risk remains 'low' and no human-to-human transmission has been confirmed, global health experts are alarmed by viral adaptations observed in Kansas cattle and rising case numbers. The outbreak has triggered economic devastation: over 168 million poultry have been culled since December 2024, reducing egg supply by 7%\u201310% and driving the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs to $5.89 in February 2025\u2014peaking above $8\u2014up from $4.10 in late 2024. The USDA paid over $1.4 billion in compensation between January 2022 and November 2024. The crisis intensified in September 2025, with nearly 7 million farm birds dead, including 1.3 million turkeys, threatening Thanksgiving supplies. Wild bird infections surged, and outbreaks were confirmed in Idaho, Nebraska, and Texas. The pandemic coincided with a federal government shutdown due to partisan budget disputes, which severely disrupted the public health response. The CDC\u2019s official avian flu website displayed a notice stating it was 'under revision in accordance with a presidential executive order,' and the agency ceased publishing its vital biweekly H5N1 situation summaries starting January 17, 2025. Although emergency plans claimed essential services would continue, in practice, data collection, analysis, and oversight were halted. The CDC acknowledged delays in monitoring report analysis and inability to guide state and local health departments. Systemic damage included the dismissal of public health inspectors, freezing of NIH research funding reviews, and massive cuts to USAID personnel, leading to the abrupt termination of U.S. surveillance programs in 49 countries. The shutdown, a political choice rather than a natural disaster, turned the public health system into a casualty of partisan conflict, severely undermining the CDC\u2019s credibility as the nation\u2019s source of truth. This erosion of trust\u2014critical during any pandemic\u2014inflicted lasting damage on America\u2019s most vital intangible asset: public confidence in science and government.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:07 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://technews.tw/2025/10/28/with-h5n1-bird-flu-ravaging-the-u-s-the-federal-government-cuts-research-budgets-and-shuts-down/)\n\n**Germany Sacrifices Over 500,000 Birds to Contain Avian Influenza Outbreak**\nOver 500,000 birds have been slaughtered in Germany to contain the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), according to data released by the German national zoonosis research center, the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), on October 27, 2025. Since early September, 31 outbreaks have been detected in poultry farms, leading to the culling of chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys. Additionally, 73 cases have been identified in wild birds since last month. In Neutrebbin near Berlin, a farm sacrificed 50,000 chickens, with the birds loaded into a truck using a backhoe. A FLI spokesperson noted that the numbers are snapshots of a rapidly evolving situation and reflect the scale of the epizootic rather than exact totals. The disease has spread more rapidly than usual, with unprecedented mortality among wild cranes in Brandenburg, where volunteers in protective gear collected hundreds of dead birds near Berlin. The Ministry of Agriculture, led by Minister Alois Raine, emphasized the need to prevent viral spread, protect animals, and safeguard agriculture and food industries. Wild birds migrating from southern regions are the primary carriers, with infection risk increasing significantly during autumn migration. The FLI warns that more cases are expected. Concerns are rising over potential price increases for chicken and eggs, prompting calls to confine free-range birds in enclosed facilities. The German Poultry Industry Association president, Hans-Peter Goldnick, supports nationwide confinement as the most effective measure. However, Robert Schmack, head of Bavaria\u2019s Poultry Union, warns of up to a 40% price surge for eggs and reduced supermarket variety. Goldnick disputes this, stating no short-term price spikes are expected, especially around Christmas, due to most geese being imported from Hungary and Poland. Avian influenza is a highly contagious disease caused by mutated influenza viruses, fatal to turkeys and chickens. Human infections are rare and typically occur only through contact with infected birds; the fatality rate is about 50%. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in the past two decades, the virus has infected around 950 people, resulting in approximately 460 deaths. The FLI advises avoiding contact with dead birds and not using contaminated boots near vulnerable poultry.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 09:50 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/pt-br/alemanha-sacrifica-500-mil-aves-para-conter-gripe-avi%C3%A1ria/a-74518245)\n\n**What is Avian Influenza?**\nThe avian influenza virus H5N1, which spreads annually with the migration of wild birds, has caused continuous and nearly global outbreaks in wild and domestic birds since autumn 2021. The virus has returned to Germany with significant force, resulting in over 30 outbreaks in poultry farms and the culling of approximately 400,000 birds. In the past weeks, dead wild birds have been found at more than 70 locations across nearly all regions of Germany. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut emphasizes that the current situation is a snapshot, and the virus is likely to spread rapidly as the peak of bird migration approaches. Experts predict that meat and egg prices may rise significantly during the pre-Christmas period. While the virus has not yet posed a danger to humans, it has infected numerous mammals, and at least 70 human cases have been reported in the United States, mostly with mild symptoms. Crucially, human-to-human transmission has not occurred. However, specialists remain alarmed, warning that mutations could potentially make H5N1 dangerous for humans in the future.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 01:39 PM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/meinung/vogelgrippe-h5n1-virus-lexikon-li.3330783)\n\n**Mexico reports new human case of H5 bird flu - BNO News**\nMexico has reported a new human case of H5 avian influenza in a 23-year-old woman in Mexico City, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The patient, who had no recent travel history, developed symptoms on September 14, beginning with respiratory issues such as a runny nose and cough, which progressed to fever, painful swallowing, hemoptysis (coughing up blood), and chest pain. She was hospitalized and tested positive for unsubtypeable influenza A on September 29; real-time RT-PCR confirmed the presence of influenza A(H5) the following day. She was treated with oseltamivir and discharged on October 11. Health authorities noted that a dog and several birds\u2014including a poultry bird and two pigeons\u2014lived at her residence, with bird droppings found in multiple areas, including a poorly sealed cistern supplying water to all apartments. Environmental samples are still being analyzed, but animal samples tested positive for influenza A(H5). All 41 identified contacts of the patient tested negative for the virus. The specific H5 subtype remains unknown. This marks Mexico\u2019s second human case of avian influenza in 2024, following a fatal H5N2 case in the State of Mexico. Earlier in the year, a 3-year-old girl in northern Mexico died from an H5N1 infection linked to Genotype D1.1, which has also caused severe illness in a teenager in Canada and an adult in Wyoming, and a fatal case in Louisiana\u2014the first confirmed H5N1 death in the U.S. The H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b and its genotypes have raised global health concerns due to their wide geographic spread and ability to infect birds and mammals.

Despite these developments, human cases remain limited, with only one case detected in May 2022 (Canada) and no confirmed human-to-human transmission. Three leading theories explain the low human mortality: (1) pre-existing immunity from prior exposure to seasonal or past influenza strains, particularly the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, which may offer cross-protection; (2) viral adaptation and host specificity, as the virus remains primarily adapted to birds and has not yet evolved efficient human-to-human transmission; and (3) limited human exposure, with most cases linked to direct contact with infected poultry, especially among culling workers. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. CDC emphasize continued surveillance to detect any changes in the virus that could increase transmissibility or virulence. Recent findings confirm H5N1 was detected in raw cow\u2019s milk in the U.S., with high concentrations reported, and studies show that past H1N1 immunity may shield against severe H5N1 illness. The risk to the general public remains low, but vigilance is essential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:03 PM\nSource:[world-today-news.com](https://www.world-today-news.com/h5n1-flu-why-north-america-isnt-more-deadly/)\n\n**California Child Infected With H5N1 Bird Flu, Source Unknown**\nA San\u202fFrancisco child infected with H5N1 bird flu in December\u202f2024 was identified through enhanced surveillance, but no clear source of exposure was found. The case, reported by the San\u202fFrancisco Department of Public Health and the CDC in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on September\u202f4\u202f2025, involved a school\u2011aged child who exhibited typical flu\u2011like symptoms\u2014fever, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and conjunctivitis\u2014for about a week before testing positive for H5N1. Authorities traced 67 close contacts\u2014including household members, classmates, and health\u2011care providers\u2014but all tested samples were negative, leaving no evidence of onward transmission. The child had not traveled, visited farms, or been near poultry or wild birds; the family had purchased poultry from a live\u2011bird market, but it was cooked and eaten well before the illness began. Genetic sequencing identified the virus as clade\u202f2.3.4.4b, genotype\u202fB3.13, the same lineage driving the California dairy outbreak and found in cats and wild birds, yet it lacked mutations associated with efficient human\u2011to\u2011human transmission. This case is one of 70 confirmed U.S. H5N1 infections since 2023, with only three\u2014this one included\u2014having no identifiable source. American cases have largely been mild, with one death reported, contrasting with the higher fatality rates seen globally. The incident underscores gaps in understanding environmental reservoirs and transmission pathways of H5N1 in urban settings and highlights the need for rapid diagnostic capacity and robust surveillance. The CDC currently rates the risk to the public as 'low', but the unknowns remain significant.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 05, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndrake/2025/09/05/california-child-infected-with-h5n1-bird-flu-source-unknown/)\n\n**Seventy U.S. Bird Flu Cases Underscore How Much We Still Don't Know**\nBetween March\u202f2024 and May\u202f2025, 70 human H5N1 infections were confirmed in the United States, with 4 requiring hospitalization and 1 fatality \u2013 a mortality rate far lower than the roughly 50\u202f% global rate for H5N1.  The CDC study led by Melissa\u202fRolfes found that 59\u202f% of cases were linked to dairy cows, about a third to commercial poultry, and two to backyard poultry; all cases involved direct animal contact, and three had no clear source but genetic sequencing tied them to cattle\u2011associated viruses.  Rolfes notes that the virus has not spread efficiently between people, as none of 180 household contacts tested positive for H5 antibodies.  The study attributes the milder U.S. cases to factors such as younger, healthier workers, rapid monitoring and treatment, and limited exposure dose.  Ninety\u2011one percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino, reflecting the agricultural workforce.  No new U.S. cases have been reported since February\u202f2025, but surveillance continues.  \"The 70 human cases of A(H5N1) in the U.S. continue to be linked to exposure to infected or dead animals, mostly dairy cows and commercial poultry,\" Rolfes said, adding, \"There have been 2 cases associated with exposure to infected poultry kept in backyards; both cases were hospitalized and 1 of these patients unfortunately died.\"\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 27, 2025 11:40 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndrake/2025/08/27/bird-flu-in-the-us-seventy-human-cases-mostly-mild-but-with-warning-signs/)\n\n**Human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses in the United States from March 2024 to May 2025 - Nature Medicine**\nBetween March 2024 and October 2024, 46 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) were detected in the United States.

    "summary": "Across all expert forecasts and disciplines, there is overwhelming consensus that the probability of the CDC reporting 10,000 or more H5 avian influenza cases in the United States before January 1, 2026, is extremely low\u2014typically placed at or near 1% (or 0% by some forecasters). Experts from epidemiology, veterinary medicine, infectious disease surveillance, animal health policy, and public health converge on several key points: (1) The current and historical base rate of CDC-confirmed/probable human H5 cases remains in the dozens to, at most, low hundreds per year, with no precedent for explosive growth into the thousands without sustained human-to-human transmission. (2) No evidence currently exists for efficient or sustained human-to-human H5 transmission in the US; nearly all human cases are due to direct animal exposure. (3) Even with the theoretical risk of a mutation enabling efficient human adaptation (such as the single glutamine to leucine mutation in hemagglutinin), experts note that such an event has not been detected in the US and would likely have already resulted in visible, newsworthy outbreaks or hospitalizations if it were happening. (4) The federal government shutdown and CDC reporting infrastructure issues further reduce, not increase, the odds of a rapid surge in reported cases within the remaining weeks, and surveillance/reporting bottlenecks would more likely result in undercounting than overcounting. (5) Even considering potential under-ascertainment or mild/asymptomatic cases, official CDC reporting is restricted to laboratory-confirmed or probable cases, so true incidence does not equate to reported counts for this question's resolution. All forecasters lay out highly improbable 'yes' scenarios (sudden catastrophic mutation with explosive spread and detection, or abrupt, sweeping changes in CDC reporting definitions), but none see such trajectories reflected in current data or public health alerts. In conclusion, all expert analyses point to a near-zero chance of hitting the 10,000-case threshold before the deadline, making a 'No' resolution the overwhelmingly likely outcome.",
