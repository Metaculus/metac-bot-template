The June 2025 strikes represent the greatest acute threat since the position's founding, and the loss of military/security leadership could accelerate regime vulnerability. Open-source indicators do NOT confirm Khamenei's death, deposition, or flight abroad. The regime's narrative describes hardship but not collapse. Israel and the US have the operational means and situational awareness to attempt leadership targeting again, but Trump's explicit veto, Israel's calculus on escalation, and the bureaucratic inertia associated with holiday/travel seasons make a late-year kinetic operation less likely. Internally, while elite rotation may sow instability, new commanders are in place and no credible coup, defection, or mass protest wave has emerged in the current reporting. With 6 weeks left in 2025 and intense external and internal pressure, the tail risk of an extraordinary event (assassination or sudden death) is higher than in a typical year but remains below 1-in-5.

Additionally, the base rate of Supreme Leader mortality or overthrow in a given year\u2014even late life\u2014is low: Neither Khomeini (1980s nor Brezhnev/Eastern Bloc analogs), nor historical Ayatollahs, were frequently forcibly removed. Khamenei\u2019s age increases natural risk, but the year is almost over and no health crisis or succession drama is visible. Therefore, while the odds this year are higher than normal\u2014due to unprecedented external targeting, leadership attrition, and regime stress\u2014the final six weeks make a last-minute, reportable dethronement or death from unnatural causes less likely, and no substantial internal or publicized elite plot is evident.

Historically, Supreme Leaders and similar autocrats rarely lose office quickly after war losses or limited elite decapitation. Public threats notwithstanding, Israel is constrained, and US involvement further reduces risk. There is also no sign Khamenei is in hiding, has fled, or has been detained.

The regime apparatus has adapted by appointing successors, managing funerals and narratives, and maintaining order following the attack. Israel's overt threats matter, but successful targeting is operationally unlikely, especially given U.S. reluctance to pursue decapitation. The death or incapacitation of an 86-year-old man is always a material possibility, especially under stress, and the demise of so many close associates increases the unpredictability of succession. Historically, however, the Supreme Leader's position has proven extremely robust, even during national trauma. There is no evidence of coup attempts, Khamenei continues with public activity, and no credible rumors suggest imminent forced regime change. Outright regime collapse and flight into exile is exceedingly improbable by year-end 2025; any internal move against Khamenei would likely require more time and clearer signs of fragmentation.

No additional hard evidence of instability or Khamenei's incapacitation has emerged in deliberation, but the current environment remains more volatile than in any prior post-1979 year outside of 1989. In balance, keeping the probability slightly above the 12-14% cluster of most forecasters remains justified due to that compounded acute risk, but not to the degree that would warrant raising further.

While acknowledging arguments that risks this year are materially higher than typical years, the near-universal absence of indications of public or elite breakdown, plus the continually narrowing window of 2025, reaffirms that a probability higher than 8% would inflate hypothetical and largely indirect risks beyond what the evidence warrants. Therefore, I do not revise my forecast.",

There is consensus that the risk profile is significantly elevated due to age and the unprecedented regime decapitation in June; several forecasters argue even more strongly for a higher tail risk premium. However, no direct new indicators of Khamenei's imminent demise, internal elite coup, or near-term regime collapse have emerged, and regime adaptation/continuity signals remain strong. While some argue for a probability as high as 16-18%, my original 14% already incorporates a historically unusual stress and succession uncertainty\u2014substantially above a typical year. On balance, the critiques validate my emphasis on regime resilience while perhaps acknowledging a marginal increase in black swan risk.

A common theme among the more compelling arguments is the unique nature of the June 2025 elite decapitation creating a risk profile not captured by base rates alone. While my initial forecast already reflected elevated compound risk (age, acute external threats, regime shock, and the remaining six-week timeframe), engagement with forecasters who forcefully rejected sub-10% inertia\u2014particularly via indicators-and-warnings and vulnerability methodology\u2014emphasizes that this year is a historically rare, outlier moment. Counterarguments against overemphasizing regime continuity are persuasive: the loss of Khamenei's closest security circle and public, resolute Israeli targeting do create conditions for an unusual tail event, not totally analogous to previous years. However, there is still no evidence of acute health crisis, regime fragmentation, or coup activity, and post-crisis regime functions remain robust. Therefore, a modest upward adjustment is warranted, but not to the level of the highest outlier (18%).",

In group deliberation, several forecasters criticized overreliance on regime inertia and highlighted the uniquely destabilizing confluence of Khamenei's advanced age, the extraordinary loss of his trusted military/security circle, psychological stress, and the serious (if still unlikely) external threat from Israel. In particular, arguments from IntelligenceAnalysisLeadershipVulnerabilityAssessment and MiddleEastStudiesIslamicRepublicEliteDynamics persuasively stressed that this year is an outlier, not simply 'another tough year,' and that the black swan risk from regime shock, instability, or sudden health crisis deserves a slightly bigger premium\u2014even in the absence of concrete coup/succession evidence. At the same time, no one brought evidence of actual elite fracture or hidden succession moves; regime messaging, even after the purge, remains tightly unified. But the 'tail risk'\u2014compounded by both advanced age and shock trauma\u2014probably warrants a mild upward revision into the low teens. I remain convinced that regime structure and elite networks make continuity still far and away the most likely outcome, but recognize that 2025's acute instability justifies accepting somewhat higher compounded risk.",

The consensus among forecasters with diverse methodologies\u2014Intelligence Analysis, Political Science, Middle East Studies, and Diplomatic Monitoring\u2014all converge in the low teens, underscoring not only regime resilience but the lack of current open-source evidence for a pending, reportable leadership transition. The argument that the security state has tightened its grip post-crisis, and that day-to-day stability is maintained in elite circles, is compelling. Social movement spillover seems less plausible within the tight resolution window, even amid heightened external and actuarial risks. I still believe the probability is distinctly elevated above the actuarial baseline due to Khamenei's age and the extraordinary decapitation of his security circle, but in light of the group's well-argued critiques, I am revising slightly downward to align closer to the expert mean.",

The original question's background info at this time is below. \n\nSince 1989 Ali Khamenei, 86, has been [Supreme Leader of Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran), a position that has been [described](https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran) by Freedom House as having the ultimate power within the country.&#x20;\n\nOn June 13, 2025, Israel [launched an air campaign](https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-special-edition-israeli-strikes-iran-june-13-2025-200-pm-et) targeting Iran's nuclear program and regime leadership, which killed several of Khamenei's top lieutenants such as Mohammad Bagheri, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces; Gholam Ali Rashid, commander of the central headquarters of the Iranian Armed Forces (whose successor was in turn killed 4 days later in an Israeil airstrke); and Hossein Salami, who was commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&#x20;\n\nUS President Donald Trump is [said to have vetoed](https://www.timesofisrael.com/trump-said-to-veto-khamenei-assassination-netanyahu-conflict-may-result-in-regime-change/) an Israeli plan to kill Khameinei as part of its campaign against Iran. Two days later Trump [posted](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114699610769479275) on social media:&#x20;\n\n> We know exactly where the so-called \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there - We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don\u2019t want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\n\nOn June 19, 2025, Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, [said](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/19/israel-threatens-irans-top-leader-after-missiles-damage-hospital-and-wound-more-than-200-00414195) Israel's military \"has been instructed and knows that in order to achieve all of its goals, this man absolutely should not continue to exist.\" Additionally, regime change is another Israeli and American objective that has emerged since the start of the campaign.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_closes_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38671,\"question_id\":37895}}`",
        "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as **Yes** if, in calendar year 2025, [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) report that Ali Khamenei has ceased to be the Supreme Leader of Iran for any reason.",

For example, reports that Khamenei has travelled to another country for medical treatment or a state visit would be considered temporary and would be insufficient. However, a departure in the context of a regime change in Tehran would be considered indefinite and would resolve as Yes. To assess the truth of the matter, Metaculus will consult credible source reporting. As an example, a hypothetical question on Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's [departure from Iran](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/january-16/shah-flees-iran) in 1979 would have resolved as Yes due to the preponderance of reporting, even though Pahlavi did not relinquish his title as Shah.",

Iran has now shifted focus from nuclear enrichment to expanding its ballistic missile arsenal. The newspaper reports that after five months of conflict with Israel in June 2025, Iran's centrifuge facilities\u2014comprising around 20,000 machines\u2014were largely destroyed, and uranium enrichment has ceased. In a rare public admission, an Iranian official confirmed the halt in enrichment activities, marking a strategic failure. Israel and the U.S. have destroyed Iran's nuclear infrastructure to such an extent that the regime has abandoned repairing its old facilities. While the nuclear threat is no longer the primary concern, the growing ballistic missile stockpile poses the main danger: intelligence estimates suggest Iran had approximately 2,500 missiles before June 2025, with projections of 6,000 by 2026 and up to 10,000 by early 2028. Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, is reportedly recognizing that direct confrontation with Israel is unviable and is instead focusing on regional influence competition. The newspaper calls for three key steps: first, establishing a fully integrated regional defense system with shared early warning, radar coverage, and unified response protocols; second, enhancing intelligence sharing on Iranian production sites, supply routes, and test activities, treating attacks on them as collective warnings; and third, crafting a unified diplomatic message stating that a large-scale missile attack on any regional capital will be viewed as an attack on the entire region. The article concludes that the missile threat is now the central challenge for Israel and the region, and the sooner coordinated action is taken, the greater the chance of preventing a future war far worse than any previous one.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 07:23 PM\nSource:[24.ae](https://24.ae/article/930700/%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%81%D8%B4%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE)\n\n**Trump Claims U.S. Produces Best Weapons in the World Amid Diplomatic Visit**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump claimed during a meeting at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that the United States produces the best aircraft and missiles in the world. He stated, 'We make the best military equipment. You saw it during the brief exchange with Iran,' referring to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan in June 2025. In response, bin Salman smirked. Trump reiterated his claim, emphasizing, 'We make the best planes, rockets, and defensive missiles.' During the same visit, bin Salman announced Saudi Arabia's intention to increase its investments in the U.S. economy to nearly $1 trillion. The U.S. strikes followed Iran's attack on the major U.S. airbase Al-Udeid in Qatar. Trump claimed that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which began on June 24, 2025. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei responded by stating that Trump could continue to believe he destroyed Iran's entire nuclear industry.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 06:57 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/politics/tramp-zayavil-chto-ssha-yakoby-proizvodyat-luchshee-oruzhie-v-mire)\n\n**Tehran: Uranium Enrichment Suspended Due to Damage to Nuclear Facilities**\nIran's government announced that uranium enrichment is currently technically impossible due to damage to nuclear facilities caused by airstrikes by Israel and the United States in June 2025. Press secretary Fatemeh Mohajerani stated at a press conference in Tehran that the damage to nuclear sites renders the process unfeasible, calling demands to halt enrichment 'practically meaningless' in light of the current situation. She clarified that President Masoud Pezeshkian's earlier remarks about the potential evacuation of Tehran were a warning to raise public awareness about the water crisis, emphasizing that evacuating the capital is impossible. Mohajerani also confirmed that Pezeshkian sent a message to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, expressing gratitude for effective cooperation during the return of Iranian pilgrims from Hajj amid the June hostilities, and reaffirming willingness to improve bilateral relations. The conflict began on June 13, 2025, when Israel launched early-morning airstrikes targeting nuclear sites in Isfahan and Natanz, killing 6 nuclear scientists, 12 senior commanders from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and military personnel. Israel stated its intent to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities and ballistic capabilities. Iran retaliated with a missile strike on Israel, killing 1 person. The conflict, involving both Israel and the U.S. on one side and Iran on the other, ended on the 12th day under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. According to Iranian sources, 606 people were killed and 5,332 injured in Israeli strikes. In Iran's retaliatory strikes, 28 people were killed and 1,272 injured in Israel. Israeli sources reported that Iran launched over 530 missiles at Israel during the 12-day conflict, with most intercepted by air defense systems.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ru/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80/%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%B8%D0%B7-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%8F%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2/3746885)\n\n**Iran Ready to Consider Russian and Chinese Mediation on IAEA Cooperation**\nIran's senior adviser to Supreme Leader, Khamal Kharaazi, stated on Tuesday, November 18, 2025, that Iran is prepared to consider mediation proposals from Russia and China regarding restoring cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Responding to a question from Sputnik news agency, Kharaazi confirmed, 'Yes, if such a project is proposed, we will study it.' The IAEA's Director General, Rafael Grossi, had previously urged Iran to 'seriously improve' its cooperation with UN inspectors to prevent escalating tensions with Western countries. On November 18, 2025, the IAEA formally demanded access to verify Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, particularly highly enriched uranium, based on unpublicized reports. This comes after Israel launched surprise airstrikes on June 13, 2025, targeting military sites and nuclear facilities in Iran, including the key Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The strikes resulted in the deaths of several prominent Iranian nuclear scientists, military commanders, and officials, including Revolutionary Guard Commander Hussein Suleimani, Army Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri, and Air and Space Force Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh. Iran retaliated with missile strikes against Israel in a military operation named 'Al-Wa'd al-Sadiq 3,' targeting dozens of military sites and air bases in Israel.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 07:27 AM\nSource:[24.ae](https://24.ae/article/930589/%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-)\n\n**Iran assesses the damage and lashes out after Israeli and US strikes damage its nuclear sites**\nOn July 1, 2025, Iran assessed the damage from a series of U.S. and Israeli airstrikes targeting its nuclear facilities, including the Fordo site, which is built under a mountain. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC and Maxar Technologies showed Iranian personnel, including trucks, cranes, and excavators, inspecting and working at the damaged tunnels at Fordo on Monday, indicating ongoing damage assessment and recovery efforts. Iran\u2019s judiciary spokesman, Asghar Jahangir, reported a government-issued death toll of 935 Iranian citizens killed in the 12-day conflict with Israel, including 38 children and 102 women. However, the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group estimated the death toll at 1,190, including 436 civilians and 435 security force members, with 4,475 wounded. Hundreds of thousands attended the funeral of top Revolutionary Guard commanders and nuclear scientists in Tehran. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not announced a date for potential U.S. talks, with Iranian official Mohajerani stating no decision has been made, though talks are not ruled out. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has kept dialogue open, but hard-line factions, including the Kayhan newspaper, have strongly opposed negotiations, with managing editor Hossein Shariatmadari calling any negotiator a 'traitor or stupid' and suggesting the IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi should be 'tried and executed' if he visits Iran\u2014statements that drew international condemnation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 01, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-iran-satellite-photos-nuclear-sites-us-da82442dd4d526e69a4f1e77a72f3dfd)\n\n**Jerusalem Post: Iranian Nuclear Failure Unleashes the Nightmare of Missiles**\nAccording to Israel's 'Jerusalem Post', the failure of Iran's nuclear program has not eliminated the threat but has highlighted the importance of decisive actions, clear red lines, and regional support in influencing Tehran's decisions.

During the same visit, bin Salman announced Saudi Arabia's intention to increase its investments in the U.S. economy to nearly $1 trillion. The U.S. strikes followed Iran's attack on the major U.S. airbase Al-Udeid in Qatar. Trump claimed that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire, which began on June 24, 2025. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei responded by stating that Trump could continue to believe he destroyed Iran's entire nuclear industry.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 06:57 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/politics/tramp-zayavil-chto-ssha-yakoby-proizvodyat-luchshee-oruzhie-v-mire)\n\n**Tehran: Uranium Enrichment Suspended Due to Damage to Nuclear Facilities**\nIran's government announced that uranium enrichment is currently technically impossible due to damage to nuclear facilities caused by airstrikes by Israel and the United States in June 2025. Press secretary Fatemeh Mohajerani stated at a press conference in Tehran that the damage to nuclear sites renders the process unfeasible, calling demands to halt enrichment 'practically meaningless' in light of the current situation. She clarified that President Masoud Pezeshkian's earlier remarks about the potential evacuation of Tehran were a warning to raise public awareness about the water crisis, emphasizing that evacuating the capital is impossible. Mohajerani also confirmed that Pezeshkian sent a message to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, expressing gratitude for effective cooperation during the return of Iranian pilgrims from Hajj amid the June hostilities, and reaffirming willingness to improve bilateral relations. The conflict began on June 13, 2025, when Israel launched early-morning airstrikes targeting nuclear sites in Isfahan and Natanz, killing 6 nuclear scientists, 12 senior commanders from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and military personnel. Israel stated its intent to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities and ballistic capabilities. Iran retaliated with a missile strike on Israel, killing 1 person. The conflict, involving both Israel and the U.S. on one side and Iran on the other, ended on the 12th day under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump. According to Iranian sources, 606 people were killed and 5,332 injured in Israeli strikes. In Iran's retaliatory strikes, 28 people were killed and 1,272 injured in Israel. Israeli sources reported that Iran launched over 530 missiles at Israel during the 12-day conflict, with most intercepted by air defense systems.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ru/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80/%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D0%B2-%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BE-%D0%B8%D0%B7-%D0%B7%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%8F%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8A%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2/3746885)\n\n**Iran Ready to Consider Russian and Chinese Mediation on IAEA Cooperation**\nIran's senior adviser to Supreme Leader, Khamal Kharaazi, stated on Tuesday, November 18, 2025, that Iran is prepared to consider mediation proposals from Russia and China regarding restoring cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Responding to a question from Sputnik news agency, Kharaazi confirmed, 'Yes, if such a project is proposed, we will study it.' The IAEA's Director General, Rafael Grossi, had previously urged Iran to 'seriously improve' its cooperation with UN inspectors to prevent escalating tensions with Western countries. On November 18, 2025, the IAEA formally demanded access to verify Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium, particularly highly enriched uranium, based on unpublicized reports. This comes after Israel launched surprise airstrikes on June 13, 2025, targeting military sites and nuclear facilities in Iran, including the key Natanz uranium enrichment facility. The strikes resulted in the deaths of several prominent Iranian nuclear scientists, military commanders, and officials, including Revolutionary Guard Commander Hussein Suleimani, Army Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri, and Air and Space Force Commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh. Iran retaliated with missile strikes against Israel in a military operation named 'Al-Wa'd al-Sadiq 3,' targeting dozens of military sites and air bases in Israel.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 07:27 AM\nSource:[24.ae](https://24.ae/article/930589/%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-)\n\n**Khamenei's Advisor Shifts Tone: Iran Open to Talks with Washington if It Changes Approach**\nDespite earlier statements by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei that negotiations with the United States would yield no results, his advisor Khamal Kharaazi stated on Sunday, November 16, 2025, following a lengthy conference in Tehran, that Iran has not closed the door to dialogue. Kharaazi emphasized that talks with Washington remain possible if the U.S. changes its approach, calling for a 'positive stance' based on mutual respect and equality. He clarified that Iran does not reject negotiations on its nuclear program but will not relinquish its defensive capabilities or peaceful uranium enrichment activities. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated that Iran has no undeclared nuclear facilities and that all nuclear sites are under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. Iranian officials warned the IAEA against issuing a resolution hostile to Iran, with Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharib Abadi stating that Iran would conduct a 'fundamental review' of its relations if such a decision is made. IAEA head Mohammad Eslami called on the agency to define its role and responsibilities in the event of a military attack on nuclear facilities, enabling Iran to negotiate on that basis. Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA and barred inspectors from damaged sites after accusing the agency of bias and failure to condemn Israeli attacks following a 12-day war in June 2025. Although a new cooperation framework was reached in September 2025, Iran declared it null and void weeks later after Britain, France, and Germany reactivated UN sanctions previously lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The agreement formally expired in October 2025, though it had effectively ceased to function since the U.S. withdrawal during Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 01:11 PM\nSource:[LebanonDebate](https://www.lebanondebate.com/article/763516-%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%B7%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%85%D9%83%D9%86%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%86%D9%87%D8%AC%D9%87%D8%A7)\n\n**Khamenei's Advisor: Iran Open to Talks with Washington if Respect is Shown**\nIran's national security advisor, Khamal Kharazi, stated that negotiations with the United States are possible if Washington changes its approach, despite earlier remarks by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that talks would yield no results.

The war, which lasted 12 days, was not defined by territorial gains but by Iran's ability to impose its will and reshape the regional balance of power. General Naeini emphasized that Iran's rapid response\u2014within an hour of the initial Israeli attack\u2014was due to years of systematic planning, military readiness, and foresight by commanders who deemed war 'inevitable' as early as February of the previous year. The attack resulted in the martyrdom of senior military leaders, including Bagheri, Rashid, and Salami, yet command structures were swiftly restored. Iran\u2019s Aerospace units executed a historic missile operation despite a 12-hour delay in leadership appointments. Naeini contrasted the 12-Day War with the eight-year Iran-Iraq War, noting that while both were part of a U.S.-backed project to undermine Iran, the 12-Day War was a technologically advanced, asymmetric conflict driven by extra-regional threats\u2014particularly from the U.S. and Israel. He stated that Iran\u2019s armed forces are continuously innovating and surpassing previous capabilities, and that any future aggression would be met with a far more decisive and regret-inducing response. He dismissed threats of a new war as psychological warfare, asserting that Iran\u2019s growing military strength prevents any new aggressive decisions by adversaries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 09:23 AM\nSource:[Mehr News Agency](https://en.mehrnews.com/news/238869/Israel-not-dare-to-wage-war-as-Iran-missile-power-stands-high)\n\n**Iran's Foreign Minister: Tehran No Longer Enriches Uranium Amid Escalating Attacks**\nIran's Foreign Minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, stated on November 17, 2025, that Iran is no longer enriching uranium due to attacks on its nuclear facilities by Israel and the United States in June 2024. He emphasized that all Iranian nuclear installations are under the safeguards and supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and that there is currently no undeclared nuclear enrichment activity. Araghchi reaffirmed Iran's 'inalienable' right to nuclear enrichment for peaceful purposes, asserting that the country will not yield to 'harassment and excessive demands.' He reiterated Iran's commitment to diplomacy and peaceful dispute resolution. The claims follow a 12-day conflict beginning June 13, 2024, when Israel launched an unprovoked attack on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities, military commanders, senior officials, and nuclear scientists. The U.S. joined the offensive, striking three major Iranian nuclear sites. In response, Iran attacked the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East in Qatar. A ceasefire was declared on June 24, 2024. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that the U.S. attacks had destroyed Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities, calling it a fantasy. 'The right of Iran to enrichment, including the peaceful use of nuclear technology, is undeniable,' Araghchi said, adding that Iran 'will never renounce its rights.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[RT en Espa\u00f1ol](https://actualidad.rt.com/actualidad/573316-canciller-irani-teheran-enriquece-uranio)\n\n**Khamenei's Advisor Urges U.S. to Engage in Genuine, Equal Negotiations**\nAli Khamenei, the advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, called on the United States to engage in genuine negotiations based on equality, stating that Iran will not enter talks with Western nations that impose demands through force or war. He emphasized that President Donald Trump must abandon the idea that pressure can force Iran to make concessions, reaffirming Iran's readiness for equal dialogue but its refusal to give up uranium enrichment. In a speech at a Tehran conference, Iran's Strategic Foreign Relations Council head Khamal Kharaazi told Trump: 'Just as your predecessors experienced, Iran cannot be destroyed by force and remains steadfast in defending its rights. Study their lessons, come to real negotiations with mutual respect, and know that we will not relinquish enrichment or our military strength.'

Pakpour, appointed after the killing of former IRGC commander Major General Hossein Salami in an Israeli strike on June 13, made the threat during a meeting with Iraqi National Security Adviser Qasim al-Araji, according to Tasnim news agency.

He claimed that Israel did not anticipate Iran's missile capability to target sensitive Israeli centers and described Israel as being in a state of frustration after the '12-day war' in June 2024. Khamenei also accused the United States of being responsible for regional conflicts and destruction, criticizing former U.S. President Donald Trump for attempting to boost Israeli morale with 'empty and baseless' statements during his visit to occupied territories. Israel launched a 12-day war on Iran on June 13, 2024, targeting nuclear facilities, military sites, civilian areas, and assassinating senior military leaders, including the Revolutionary Guard commander and the Armed Forces chief, along with prominent nuclear scientists. Iran responded with a series of missile attacks causing unprecedented destruction in several Israeli cities. In a separate statement, Iran's Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Abdolrahim Mousavi, said Iran has no current plans to attack Israel but warned that any future aggression would provoke a response 'completely different' from past confrontations. He emphasized that Iran maintains the highest level of readiness, closely monitors enemy movements, and stressed that the world now respects Iran for its faith, resilience, and independence. Mousavi described Iran's ongoing struggle as a comprehensive battle in the information and cognitive space, urging media, intellectuals, and universities to combat disinformation and build public awareness to resist psychological warfare. He added that Iran is closely tracking its adversaries' actions and that any future confrontation would be unlike any in the past, noting that the 'final slap' delivered to enemies has made them realize that repeating the mistake of confronting Iran will be costly.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 01:22 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/10/20/%d8%ae%d8%a7%d9%85%d9%86%d8%a6%d9%8a-%d8%a5%d9%8a%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%b1%d8%af-%d8%a8%d8%b5%d9%88%d8%a7%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%ae%d9%87%d8%a7-%d8%a5%d8%b0%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%ac%d8%af%d8%af)\n\n**Iran Appoints New Commander of 'Khatam al-Anbiya' Headquarters After Israeli Assassinations of Its Leaders**\nOn September 4, 2025, Iranian authorities announced that Ali Abdullahi has been appointed commander of the central headquarters of the 'Khatam al\u2011Anbiya' (the highest military headquarters of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps).

It also recounts that on 13 June 2024, Israel, with U.S. support, launched a 12\u2011day offensive against Iran, targeting military, nuclear, and civilian sites and assassinating military leaders and nuclear scientists, to which Iran responded by striking Israeli military and intelligence facilities with ballistic missiles and drones.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 04, 2025 04:06 PM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=04092025&id=82797fb2-43bd-48af-97a1-3254023fb866)\n\n**Israel targeted top Iranian leaders by hacking, tracing their bodyguards' phones  --  report**\nIsrael was able to track and target senior Iranian political and military leaders and nuclear scientists during the June\u202f2025 war by hacking and tracking the phones of their bodyguards and drivers, according to a New\u202fYork\u202fTimes report. In the opening strikes on June\u202f13, Israel killed four top generals \u2013 IRGC chief Hossein\u202fSalami, Armed Forces chief Mohammad\u202fBagheri, missile chief Amir\u202fAli\u202fHajizadeh and head of the Khatam\u2011al\u2011Anbiya Central Headquarters Gholam\u202fAli\u202fRashid \u2013 and at least 11 senior nuclear scientists. The Times said that although senior Iranian officials avoided using smartphones, their security detail did not, allowing Israel to trace and eliminate them. 'We know senior officials and commanders did not carry phones, but their interlocutors, security guards and drivers had phones; they did not take precautions seriously and this is how most of them were traced,' Sasan\u202fKarimi told the Times. An Israeli defense official added, 'Using so many bodyguards is a weakness that we imposed on them, and we were able to take advantage of that.' After the first wave of strikes, Iranian guards were ordered to use only walkie\u2011talkies, but a breach allowed Israel to strike a bunker on June\u202f16, injuring President Masoud\u202fPezeshkian. Brig.\u202fGen. Ahmad\u202fVahidi said, 'The enemy gets the majority of its intelligence through technology, satellites and electronic data.' Israel claimed the campaign killed dozens of senior security officials and at least 11 nuclear scientists, and it warned it could resume operations if Iran rebuilds its nuclear and missile programs. The 12\u2011day conflict ended with a ceasefire on June\u202f24 after Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs were severely damaged.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 30, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-targeted-top-iranian-leaders-by-hacking-tracing-their-bodyguards-phones-report/)\n\n**Khamenei: Iran Rejects Subjugation by America**\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, declared on Sunday that the United States seeks to subjugate Iran and that the Iranian people strongly reject this and will stand firm against any attempt to impose submission. He said, '\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0646\u064a \u064a\u0639\u062a\u0628\u0631 \u0630\u0644\u0643 \u0625\u0647\u0627\u0646\u0629 \u0648\u064a\u0631\u0641\u0636\u0647 \u0628\u0634\u062f\u0629\u060c \u0648\u0633\u064a\u0642\u0641 \u0628\u0643\u0644 \u0642\u0648\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u0629 \u0623\u064a \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0629 \u0644\u0641\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0636\u0648\u0639 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647'. Khamenei cited former President Donald Trump\u2019s statement that the goal of confronting Iran is to dominate it, noting that previous administrations hid this hostility under labels such as 'human rights', 'counter\u2011terrorism', and 'democracy'. He warned that Iran\u2019s enemies aim to create divisions within the country and dismissed calls for direct talks with Washington as superficial, adding that the 'steel shield' of the people, officials, and armed forces must not be touched. Khamenei revealed that U.S. agents met in a European capital after Israel\u2019s June\u202f13 airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites\u2014including the main enrichment facility at Natanz\u2014to discuss an \u2018alternative to the Islamic Republic\u2019, even suggesting the appointment of a king. He concluded that the Iranian people will continue to support the armed forces and government, delivering a strong slap to those who oppose them.\n\nOn June\u202f13, Israel launched surprise airstrikes targeting Iranian military and nuclear facilities, killing several high\u2011ranking officials: Quds Force commander Hussein Salami, Army chief Mohammad Bagheri, and IRGC Aerospace Force commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh. Iran responded with missile strikes on Israel, targeting dozens of military sites and airbases. On June\u202f22, the United States attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities\u2014Natanz, Fordo, and Isfahan\u2014claiming the aim was to destroy or severely weaken Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Shortly thereafter, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps struck an American base in Qatar in retaliation.\n\nThese events illustrate the escalating tensions between Iran, the United States, and Israel, with each side citing strategic objectives and responding with military actions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 24, 2025 02:29 PM\nSource:[Hespress](https://www.hespress.com/%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B6%D9%88%D8%B9-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7-1613700.html)\n\n**Iranian President's Office Reveals New Details About Israeli Attack**\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi's office director, Mohsen Hajj Mirzaei, revealed new details about the Israeli attack on the Iranian National Security Council meeting that Raisi attended on June 16. Mirzaei stated that there was no pre-installed emergency exit, and that the only opening made after the Israeli rocket explosion was done manually to allow Raisi and those with him to exit. According to 'Fars' agency, Mirzaei said that Raisi was in stable health and able to walk despite his minor injury. He also mentioned that Iranian Chief of Staff Abdolrahim Mousavi, who was appointed as the successor to Mohammad Bagheri who was assassinated by Israel on June 13, and one of Raisi's assistants were injured due to inhaling dust from the explosion. Mirzaei stated that the medical team had to drain a pool of blood from Raisi's body the next day after the attack, as he had gone to meet Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei immediately after the attack. On June 13, Israel launched 'Operation Lion of Babylon' targeting Iranian nuclear and military sites with intense airstrikes, as well as assassinating several scientists and military leaders in the Revolutionary Guard. In response, Tehran launched rocket attacks and hundreds of protests against Israel. As the 12-day exchange of attacks between the two sides continued, coinciding with obstacles in nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington, the US carried out 'Operation Midnight Strike' on June 22, targeting three major nuclear sites in Iran. In retaliation, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard targeted US military bases in Qatar and Iraq, without reporting any human casualties, just hours before US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: August 16, 2025 07:05 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2025/8/16/2837787/%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B2%D8%B4%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A-)\n\n**Israeli Defense Chief Warns Khamenei: 'Look Up and Listen to Every Buzz' After Iran Publishes Kill List of Top Officials**\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a warning to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, saying 'look up at the sky and listen carefully to every buzz' when he emerges from his bunker, referencing Israel's drone capabilities. This comes after Iran published a hit list targeting top Israeli officials, including Katz, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and Israeli Air Force chief Tomer Bar. Katz's warning appears to be a threat, referencing Israel's coordinated military campaign that targeted Iran's senior military commanders, dubbed the 'red wedding.' The operation eliminated key Revolutionary Guards figures, including commander Hossein Salami and armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri. According to Katz, the participants of the 'red wedding' are waiting for Khamenei in the sky, suggesting that he should fear Israeli surveillance and potential targeted strikes even when moving between his heavily fortified positions in Tehran.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: August 11, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/08/11/israeli-defense-chief-warns-khamenei-iran-publishes-kill-list-top-officials/)\n\n**Khamenei Describes Loss of Military Leaders and Scientists as a 'Heavy Burden' on Iran**\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei acknowledged that Iran has suffered a significant loss after the killing of military leaders and nuclear scientists, but emphasized that Israel has not achieved its goals. Khamenei stated, 'Israel, the corrupt and criminal group, has dealt this blow, and it is the enemy of the Iranian people.' He added, 'There is no doubt that the loss of leaders such as Mohammad Bagheri, Hossein Salami, Gholam Ali Rashid, Ali Hajizadeh, and others, as well as scientists such as Mohammad Mehdi Tahrani, Fereydoun Abbasi, and others, is a heavy burden on any nation.' Khamenei emphasized that 'this enemy is short-sighted and has not achieved its goal. The future will show that the military and scientific movements will progress towards more extensive and faster horizons than in the past.' He also stressed that 'Iran has once again proven its resilience in this incident. The enemies are hitting the cold iron.' Khamenei emphasized that 'equipping the country with means of protecting its security and independence is a duty on the military leaders.' Iran has been hit by Israeli airstrikes since June 13, 2025, which have caused significant damage to the country's nuclear and military centers, killing hundreds of Iranians, including 35 prominent leaders in the Revolutionary Guard Corps, security and military agencies. In response, Iran has launched missiles and aircraft on Israeli territory, resulting in the deaths of 28 Israelis and significant damage in Tel Aviv and Haifa. Khamenei's statements come at a time when Iran's government and diplomatic team are trying to return to negotiations, while avoiding sanctions from three European countries, which are threatening to impose them unless Iran cooperates with the International Atomic Energy Agency and returns to the negotiating table with the US over its nuclear program.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: July 26, 2025 11:35 PM\nSource:[Almaghribtoday](https://www.almaghribtoday.net/43/233514-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A6%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%81-%D8%AE%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B6%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86)\n\n**Iran assesses the damage and lashes out after Israeli and US strikes damage its nuclear sites**\nOn July 1, 2025, Iran assessed the damage from a series of U.S. and Israeli airstrikes targeting its nuclear facilities, including the Fordo site, which is built under a mountain. Satellite images from Planet Labs PBC and Maxar Technologies showed Iranian personnel, including trucks, cranes, and excavators, inspecting and working at the damaged tunnels at Fordo on Monday, indicating ongoing damage assessment and recovery efforts. Iran\u2019s judiciary spokesman, Asghar Jahangir, reported a government-issued death toll of 935 Iranian citizens killed in the 12-day conflict with Israel, including 38 children and 102 women. However, the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group estimated the death toll at 1,190, including 436 civilians and 435 security force members, with 4,475 wounded. Hundreds of thousands attended the funeral of top Revolutionary Guard commanders and nuclear scientists in Tehran. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has not announced a date for potential U.S. talks, with Iranian official Mohajerani stating no decision has been made, though talks are not ruled out. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has kept dialogue open, but hard-line factions, including the Kayhan newspaper, have strongly opposed negotiations, with managing editor Hossein Shariatmadari calling any negotiator a 'traitor or stupid' and suggesting the IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi should be 'tried and executed' if he visits Iran\u2014statements that drew international condemnation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: July 01, 2025 12:26 PM\nSource:[apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-iran-satellite-photos-nuclear-sites-us-da82442dd4d526e69a4f1e77a72f3dfd)\n\n**Iran fires back at Israel after onslaught targets nuclear facilities**\nIran fired back at Israel with barrages of missiles after a massive onslaught targeted the Islamic republic's nuclear and military facilities, killing several top generals. The strikes killed Iran's highest-ranking military officer, armed forces chief of staff Mohammad Bagheri, and the head of the Revolutionary Guards, Hossein Salami. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed to bring Israel 'to ruin' during a televised address. The conflict raised questions as to whether Sunday's sixth round of talks planned between the United States and Iran to seek a deal on Iran's nuclear programme would go ahead in Oman. Iran confirmed that above-ground sections of the Natanz enrichment plant had been destroyed, but the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said radiation levels outside the site 'remained unchanged'. Netanyahu said Israeli intelligence had concluded that Iran was approaching the 'point of no return' on its nuclear programme. The United States and other Western governments have repeatedly accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon, an ambition it has consistently denied.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: June 14, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[bd24live.com](https://www.bd24live.com/iran-fires-back-at-israel-after-onslaught-targets-nuclear-facilities/)\n\n",

    "summary": "Across all expert perspectives, the consensus is that Ali Khamenei is highly likely to remain Supreme Leader of Iran through the end of 2025. Despite the extraordinary June 2025 Israeli/US air campaign that killed multiple top military and Revolutionary Guard leaders and heightened external threats\u2014including explicit Israeli statements about targeting Khamenei himself\u2014experts uniformly stress the regime's remarkable resilience, rapid elite replacement, and restored internal cohesion. The regime has shown no credible signs of collapse, mass defection, or unstoppable internal dissent, and Khamenei has continued to make public appearances and exert authority. The advanced age and actuarial health risks of Khamenei, the psychological and strategic aftershocks of losing much of his senior inner circle, and the openly stated intentions of Israeli and, to a lesser extent, US leaders do introduce a significantly higher risk than in any previous year, with several experts noting that risk is elevated to about 10\u201318% for removal, death, or forced exile by year's end (compared to the typically much lower base rate). However, the prevailing expert judgment is that the combination of heightened security, elite consensus on regime continuity, lack of credible reporting about imminent demise or deposition, deep institutional inertia, the American veto of direct assassination, and the rally-around-the-flag effect after foreign attack all sharply lower the near-term probability of Khamenei's departure. Historic precedent for abrupt, externally-induced leadership turnover is exceedingly rare in Iran's theocracy\u2014removals or deaths have strongly favored natural causes, and power transitions have occurred only after carefully managed institutional processes. Across all fields\u2014intelligence, diplomacy, political science, sociology, and Middle East studies\u2014experts assign a probability in the 8\u201318% range, with the median around 14%, for Khamenei ceasing to be Supreme Leader in 2025. The dominant expert scenario for a No outcome is that Khamenei and the regime persist through year-end thanks to security measures and elite unity; for a Yes outcome, experts see the main plausible pathways as sudden natural death, direct assassination despite constraints, or a fast-moving elite coup, none of which show credible signs of unfolding at present.",
