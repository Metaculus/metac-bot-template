Pereira's confidence is indicated by his proposition of a six-figure charity bet based on the fight outcome, which could signal a psychological edge.",

Ankalaev\u2019s focus on both striking and wrestling suggests a balanced attack plan, and his confidence is further highlighted by aggressive statements aimed at Pereira. Ankalaev's self-assuredness may indicate a readiness to exploit perceived weaknesses in Pereira's fighting style.",
