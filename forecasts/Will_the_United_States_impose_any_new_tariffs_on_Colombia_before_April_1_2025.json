The new tariffs will be tailored to each country, aiming not only to offset taxes on US goods but also to address various non-tariff barriers. However, the effective date of the measures has not been announced, with a White House official stating that the process may take several weeks or even months to complete. Commerce Secretary Luttrell indicated that all research work should be completed by April 1, after which Trump can take immediate action. Trump also announced that he will impose additional tariffs on cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. Analysts suggest that the decision not to immediately implement the measures may be seen as a signal to open negotiations rather than a firm commitment. Trump has used similar tactics in the past, such as with Mexico, Canada, and Colombia, only to temporarily back down after concessions were made.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 02:44 AM\nSource:[ET Net](https://www.etnet.com.hk/www/tc/news/home_categorized_news_detail.php?newsid=ETN350214932)\n\n**US Imposes Tariffs on Colombian Steel and Aluminum Exports**\nAs part of the US government's commercial policy, President Donald Trump announced that a 25% tariff would be imposed on all steel imports, and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, 'without exceptions or exemptions'. This decision was made considering that steel imports accounted for 30% of US consumption in 2024, a level similar to 2018 when this measure was first implemented to protect the local industry and national security. Colombia exports almost a third of its total exports to the US, with sales reaching $13.106 million in November last year, representing 29% of the total. The products that Colombia sells the most to the US are oil, flowers, coffee, aluminum, and fruits, among others. However, it's worth noting that Colombia and the US have a 12-year-old Free Trade Agreement (TLC) that allows Colombian products to enter the US market without tariffs. According to the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), Colombia still has some type of tariff or export quota on 134 items, including 52 types of cheese, 28 types of dairy products, 7 tobacco-related products, and 47 types of sugar. The chamber estimates that the new tariffs could affect over 750 million dollars in aluminum and steel exports to the US last year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 12:12 AM\nSource:[Portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/negocios/comercio/productos-en-colombia-que-se-verian-afectados-por-los-aranceles-de-trump-623836)\n\n**US Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum: Colombia's New Reality**\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 10 to eliminate exceptions for certain countries on a 25% tariff for steel and a 10% tariff for aluminum, which he had decreed in 2018 as a measure to protect the local industry and national security. This means that countries such as Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, Japan, the UK, and EU countries will now have to pay the 25% tariff imposed by Washington. According to the US government, the decision was made because in 2024, steel imports accounted for 30% of US consumption, a level similar to 2018 when the 25% tariff was imposed. The White House mentioned that imports from countries with alternative agreements increased from 74% in 2018 to 82% in 2024, showing that the agreements did not slow down the flow of imports. For aluminum, the tariff is increased from 10% to 25% for all countries. Colombia, which was not exempt, will maintain a 25% tariff for the export of steel and derivatives to the US. Colombia already had a 25% tariff for steel and a 10% tariff for aluminum exported to the US. According to the National Administrative Department of Statistics (Dane), Colombian steel exports to the US represented 0.52% of total imports in 2023, while in 2024 they were 0.3%. In 2024, Colombian steel exports to the US were $82.2 million, a 2% decrease from 2023, while aluminum sales decreased by 7% from $699.1 million in 2023 to $649.7 million in 2024.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 05:01 PM\nSource:[Portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/negocios/industrias/aranceles-de-ee-uu-a-acero-y-aluminio-asi-quedaron-tras-eliminacion-de-excepciones-623695)\n\n**Colombia Spared from Trump's 25% Steel Tariff, But Faces New Aluminum Tax**\nColombia has been spared from a 25% tariff on steel imposed by the Trump administration, but will face a new commercial tax on aluminum exports. According to an analysis by the Colombia American Chamber (Amcham Colombia), the document signed by Trump eliminates the exceptions to tariffs that were established for some countries, including Colombia, in relation to the 25% tariff on steel and the 10% tariff on aluminum, measures that were decreed in 2018. As a result, countries that had already received the tariff, including Colombia, will not face new increases in this tax. However, Colombia will face a new commercial tax on aluminum exports. The countries that will pay a 25% tariff on steel and steel products, starting from March 12, 2025, are Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 01:21 PM\nSource:[www.elcolombiano.com](https://www.elcolombiano.com/negocios/colombia-pagara-no-aranceles-de-ee-uu-por-acero-pero-si-por-aluminio-DJ26588182)\n\n**Colombia to Pay 25% Tariff on Steel and Aluminum Imports to US**\nThe White House has published a document signed by former President Donald Trump, which eliminates the exemptions for certain countries on the 25% steel tariff and 10% aluminum tariff that he imposed in 2018 as a measure to protect the local industry and national security. According to the document, starting from March 12, 2025, imports of steel and steel products from Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, South Korea, Japan, the UK, and the EU will be subject to the 25% tariff established in Proclamation 9705 (2018) and Proclamation 9980 (2020). For Colombia, which was not exempt, the tariff for the export of steel and derivatives to the US remains at 25%. The US government stated that the decision was made considering that in 2024, the participation of steel imports in US consumption reached 30%, a level similar to 2018 when the 25% tariff was imposed. Regarding aluminum, the White House explained that the tariff is increased from 10% to 25% for all countries. According to the document, the local capacity in aluminum increased from 40% in 2017 to 61% in 2019, but has since declined to 55% in 2023, prompting the decision to raise the tariff. As stated by the US government, 'the decision is taken with the consideration that the domestic industry needs to be protected to ensure the national security of the country.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 10:40 AM\nSource:[elnuevosiglo.com.co](https://www.elnuevosiglo.com.co/economia/si-china-no-puede-entrar-su-acero-eu-buscara-mercados-como-el-nuestro-camacero)\n\n**US Imposes 25% Tariff on Steel and Aluminum Imports, Affecting Colombian Companies**\nThe US has imposed a 25% tariff on imports of steel and aluminum, affecting Colombian companies that export these products to the US. According to the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce, the steel and aluminum industry represented $649.7 million in exports in 2024, with 237 national companies selling to the US market. Christian Daes, president of Tecnoglass, a leading company in the sector, has expressed confidence that the company will emerge stronger from this situation, saying 'Cada d\u00eda trae su apuro. De esta saldremos mejor que como est\u00e1bamos.' An analysis by the National Association of Foreign Trade (Analdex) estimates that the impact of this new tariff could be $750 million for the country. The affected concepts in the steel and aluminum industry are: doors, windows, and aluminum profiles (75% participation in 2024): $566.8 million in exports; and other products such as tubes, ovens, and aluminum sheets. US President Donald Trump has stated that the tariffs will apply globally and will not have exceptions for any country. He has also announced that he will hold meetings in the next four weeks to analyze new tariffs, including on vehicles, semiconductors, and pharmaceutical products.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 08:08 AM\nSource:[portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/negocios/empresas/christian-daes-presidente-de-tecnoglass-envia-mensajes-en-medio-de-situacion-por-aranceles-al-acero-623728)\n\n**Trump's Tariffs: A Potential Blow to Colombia's Exports**\nThe National Association of Foreign Trade, Analdex, has warned that the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on aluminum and steel imports could affect Colombia's exports to the tune of $750 million. According to Analdex President Javier D\u00edas Molina, it is essential to know which products will be affected by the measures as soon as possible, given the sector's vast scope. Molina recalled that in a previous instance, Trump announced similar measures, but only two products were affected. He stated, 'The last time in Trump's first term, Colombia was subject to tariffs despite having a free trade agreement. When we were told that we have a free trade agreement, we shouldn't be subject to tariffs. They told us, 'It's because the tariff is imposed for national security reasons.' Molina added, 'What will he invoke this time? We don't know, and that's why we have to wait for the executive order to know if we are subject to the tariff or not. We are waiting with bated breath, but in the worst-case scenario, it could impact up to $750 million of our exports to the US, which total over $13.15 billion.' The tariffs, announced by Trump on February 9, will impose a 25% tax on all imported aluminum or steel to the US. Colombia will be affected, as over 200 companies export aluminum or steel to the US. According to Mar\u00eda Claudia Lacouture, president of the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham Colombia), the decision will impact 237 Colombian companies that exported $649 million in aluminum and $82.2 million in steel to the US last year, despite Colombia representing only 0.3% of US imports.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[vanguardia.com](https://www.vanguardia.com/economia/2025/02/11/efectos-que-traen-los-aranceles-al-aluminio-y-acero-anunciados-por-trump/)\n\n**The Rise of 'Green Tariffs': A New Era of Protectionism and Environmental Regulation**\nThe re-election of President Trump has led to a return to protectionism and the 'zero-sum game' mentality, where a trade deficit is seen as an economic loss. The recent tariffs mark a return to isolationism, which a century ago led to the Great Depression. The European Union is implementing 'green tariffs' this year, which will condition access to the European market for sectors such as cement, steel, electricity, hydrogen, and aluminum to environmental requirements. The mechanism, known as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), will impose additional tariffs of up to 25% on imports from countries that do not meet these requirements. The EU plans to expand the mechanism to include plastics and chemicals by 2026 and all sectors subject to the European carbon tax by 2030. A new European regulation against deforestation will also come into effect this year, which will require importers to certify that their products have not contributed to the deforestation of native forests since 2020. Colombia, which is a significant exporter of products such as beef, cacao, and palm oil, will be affected by this regulation. The EU will classify countries according to their risk of deforestation and impose severe penalties, including fines equivalent to 4% of the importer's total sales. Colombia has not implemented a carbon market or certification processes for its most vulnerable export chains, making it difficult for small producers to adapt to these new regulations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 06:02 AM\nSource:[confidencialnoticias.com](https://confidencialnoticias.com/opinion/aranceles-verdes/2025/02/11/)\n\n**Colombia's National Civil Registry Announces New Tariffs for Services**\nThe National Civil Registry of Colombia has established new tariffs for its services, effective from March 1, 2025, through Resolution 1174 of 2025. The tariffs have been adjusted by 5.20%, which is the inflation rate certified by the National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE) for the previous year. Citizens who have already paid for services with the current tariffs will have until February 28 to complete their transactions. Otherwise, they will need to pay the difference at a bank or authorized service correspondent. The authorized banks and service correspondents are: Banco de Bogot\u00e1, Efecty, SuperGiros, Bemovil, Practisistemas, Megared, Punto de Pago, Banco Popular, and Matrix Giros y Servicios. The new tariffs are: $10,300 for a physical copy of the civil registry, $17,850 for an online copy, $72,450 for a personalized citizen card and digital ID, and $64,100 and $62,900 for duplicate or corrected yellow and blue ID cards, respectively.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 01:09 PM\nSource:[elpaisvallenato.com](https://www.elpaisvallenato.com/2025/02/10/registraduria-anuncio-nuevas-tarifas-para-tramite-de-los-servicios/)\n\n**US Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum Hit Colombia Hard**\nThe 25% tariff imposed by the US government on steel and aluminum imports, which came into effect on February 10, 2025, has significant effects on Colombia. The country already had a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum, imposed by Donald Trump in his first term as US president. According to Mar\u00eda Claudia Lacouture, president of the Colombian-American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham Colombia), 'this affects the sector's income, employment, and competitiveness', and it is necessary for the Colombian government to manage an exception, highlighting that these exports do not threaten the US industry, but their restriction does harm the Colombian business fabric and reduces economic opportunities, which could encourage migration.' The industry represented exports of $649.7 million in aluminum and $82.2 million in steel in 2024, through 237 national companies that sold to the US market. An analysis by the National Association of Foreign Trade (Analdex) estimates that the impact of the new tariff could be $750 million in the worst-case scenario. According to this analysis, the sub-class of aluminum doors, windows, and frames had a 75% participation in the sales generated by the entire industry, generating $566.8 million in exports. There is still uncertainty about whether the new 25% tariff will be cumulative with existing tariffs or only apply to countries that did not have any, according to Enrique Mill\u00e1n, Colombia's representative in Washington during the governments of Juan Manuel Santos and Iv\u00e1n Duque. 'What we do not know now is whether this new 25% general will be imposed on the existing tariff or only against countries that did not pay a tariff. If it is on the existing tariffs, that would mean a tariff of 50% and 25% or 35% on aluminum. If this were the case, it would be mortal for the industry, as they would lose competitiveness,' he pointed out.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 06:28 AM\nSource:[portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/negocios/industrias/arancel-al-acero-y-al-alumnio-como-se-veria-afectada-colombia-con-esta-medida-de-estados-unidos-623531)\n\n**Trump Imposes Tariffs on Colombia Amid Deportee Dispute**\nOn January 27, 2025, US President Donald Trump imposed a 25% tariff on all Colombian products after Colombian President Gustavo Petro refused to accept two flights of deportees from the US.

However, after Colombia agreed to accept the return of its citizens, the US has withdrawn its threat of tariffs and sanctions. According to a White House statement, Colombia has agreed to accept all deported immigrants from the US 'without restriction or delay.' Trump stated, 'The President will continue to vigorously defend our nation's sovereignty and expects all other countries to fully cooperate in receiving their own citizens who have been deported from the US.' If the dispute is not resolved quickly, US consumers may face price increases for gasoline, coffee, and flowers, according to Market Watch. Trump previously stated on his social media platform, 'We will not allow the Colombian government to violate its legal obligation to receive and repatriate criminals who have entered the US illegally.' Colombian President Gustavo Petro responded by imposing a 25% tariff on US imports. Petro stated, 'Colombia will continue to refuse to allow US military planes carrying deported immigrants to land unless they are treated with dignity.' The US and Colombia have a significant trade relationship, with US trade with Colombia totaling approximately $5.35 billion in 2022.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 06:51 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E8%8B%A5%E5%B0%8D%E5%93%A5%E5%80%AB%E6%AF%94%E4%BA%9E%E7%A5%AD%E9%97%9C%E7%A8%85-%E7%BE%8E%E6%B1%BD%E6%B2%B9%E5%92%96%E5%95%A1%E9%AE%AE%E8%8A%B1%E6%81%90%E5%96%8A%E6%BC%B2-062422388.html)\n\n**US and Colombia Engage in Trade War: Tariffs and Travel Bans Imposed**\nUS President Trump announced that the US will impose a 25% tariff on all Colombian goods entering the US, which will increase to 50% in a week.

Additionally, he will increase customs and border protection checks on all Colombian citizens and goods. The US State Department has also suspended visa processing at the US embassy in Bogota. Colombian President Petro responded by announcing a 25% tariff on all US goods entering Colombia. He stated that the US must establish a 'dignified treatment protocol' before receiving deported migrants. Trump claimed that Petro had initially approved the deportation flights but later cancelled them.

This move is expected to have a significant impact on the Colombian economy, particularly on the price of the basic family basket, which includes food, transportation, and education. The US is Colombia's main trading partner, accounting for 25.5% of total imports between January and October 2024. The main imports from the US include petroleum, fertilizers, machinery, and vehicles. The tariff will also affect the price of agricultural products such as corn, soybeans, and wheat, as well as industrial products like computers and electronics. The Colombian government's decision to impose tariffs on US imports is seen as a reciprocal measure, but experts warn that it will ultimately harm Colombia's competitiveness in the US market. 'We will respond with tariffs similar to those imposed by the US,' Petro said. 'Our people will continue to grow corn, which was discovered in Colombia, and feed the world.' The move is expected to have a significant impact on the Colombian economy, particularly on the price of the basic family basket.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 05:11 AM\nSource:[Diario La Rep\u00fablica](https://www.larepublica.co/economia/mincomercio-subira-25-los-aranceles-a-las-importaciones-de-ee-uu-4046657)\n\n**US to Waive 25% Tariff on Colombia Amid Agreement on Forced Repatriation of Undocumented Immigrants**\nThe US government has announced that it will not impose a 25% tariff on Colombia due to the country's agreement to accept the forced repatriation of undocumented immigrants.

However, the US will maintain other measures such as visa restrictions and increased customs inspections for undocumented immigrants until the first flight carrying them lands.

Trump said he would 'immediately' impose tariffs on 'all items' coming from Colombia and increase the rate to 50% within a week. Colombian President Gustavo Petro responded by announcing a 25% retaliatory tariff on the US. Petro said Colombia would not deport migrants 'like criminals' and would instead treat them with 'dignity and respect.' Trump has also announced that he will impose travel bans and visa revocations on Colombian government officials and their supporters, as well as increase customs and border inspections on all Colombian nationals and goods. Trump said these measures were 'just the beginning' and that Colombia would not be allowed to 'illegally push criminals into the US.' Petro responded by tweeting that Colombia's legacy and strength would not be intimidated by Trump's blockade, and that Colombia would remain open to the world. Petro also offered to provide a presidential plane to deportees from the US, saying that Colombia had over 15,666 people from the US living in the country without proper documentation. Trump's administration has promised to deport millions of migrants, and the US has already deported over 149,700 people in the 2024 fiscal year. The trade war between the two countries could have significant consequences for Colombia's economy, particularly in the coffee industry, which is worth around $2 billion. The dispute is also a reflection of the long-standing tensions between Trump and Petro, who has been critical of Trump's immigration and environmental policies.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 03:28 AM\nSource:[WEDGE Infinity(\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30b8)](https://wedge.ismedia.jp/articles/-/36459)\n\n**Trump Announces Tariffs and Travel Bans on Colombia in Response to Deportation Flight Refusal**\nUS President Trump has announced that he will impose a 25% tariff on all goods imported from Colombia in response to the country's refusal to allow US deportation flights to land.

Colombia's President Petro has refused to accept the US deportation flights, saying that the US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals and that they deserve to be treated with dignity. The US has deported thousands of migrants to Mexico, Guatemala, and Brazil, but Colombia has refused to accept the flights. The Colombian government has announced that it will establish a joint command center to handle the deportation of Colombian migrants and will maintain dialogue with the US to ensure that migrants are treated with dignity. Trump has also stated that the US will impose further measures on Colombia in response to its refusal to accept the deportation flights. The US has also announced that the ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel will remain in effect until February 18, 2025. The agreement was reached in November 2023 and was set to expire on February 18, 2024, but was extended due to the ongoing conflict.

This decision comes after a heated exchange between leaders of both countries, with President Trump threatening tariffs and visa sanctions if Colombia didn't comply. The agreement has avoided a potential trade war and could boost trade between the two countries, with the U.S. importing approximately $16 billion in goods from Colombia in 2023 alone. The White House has announced further high-level discussions to enhance cooperative efforts in various sectors.

Petro also stated that the country will substitute US products with domestic production and the government will help with this goal. The US had previously blocked Colombian planes carrying deported people, with Petro explaining that they have always accepted deportees, but not in military flights with people handcuffed. Trump responded by announcing retaliatory measures, including a 25% emergency tariff on all Colombian products entering the US, which will increase to 50% within a week. The sanctions also include travel bans and immediate revocation of visas for Colombian government officials and allies of Petro's regime.

Our exports must expand,' Petro said. This move comes after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all Colombian products, which will increase to 50% within a week, and the revocation of visas for high-ranking Colombian government officials and their families. The US is one of Colombia's main economic partners, and various products are imported from the country, including machinery, electronics, chemicals, food, and pharmaceuticals.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 10:48 PM\nSource:[La Opini\u00f3n Digital](https://laopinion.com/2025/01/26/petro-responde-a-trump-y-anuncia-25-de-aranceles-a-los-productos-importados-por-colombia-a-ee-uu/)\n\n**US Imposes 25% Tariffs and Visa Restrictions on Colombia Amid Disagreement with Gustavo Petro**\nUS President Donald Trump announced the imposition of 25% tariffs and visa restrictions on Colombia on January 26, 2025, in response to a strong disagreement with Colombian President Gustavo Petro. According to Trump, Petro's actions put national and public security at risk in the US, necessitating a government response. Trump stated that emergency tariffs of 25% will be imposed on all goods entering the US from Colombia, effectively doubling tariffs from 25% to 50% in less than a week. Additionally, Trump prohibited travel and revoked visas for all Colombian officials and their political allies, as well as their family members. Trump also announced increased security checks for Colombian citizens and products entering the US, citing national security concerns. Trump posted a photo with a 'Los Intocables' style hat, accompanied by the acronym FAFO, which stands for 'Fuck around, find out' in English, implying that Petro received his due consequences for his decision. In response, Petro offered to send the Colombian presidential plane to ensure 'dignified' deportation of Colombian migrants, and convened a commission to guarantee their treatment. Trump has yet to respond to this proposal.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[SDPnoticias.com](https://www.sdpnoticias.com/internacional/estados-unidos-contra-colombia-donald-trump-anuncia-25-de-aranceles-y-restriccion-de-visa-tras-choque-con-gustavo-petro)\n\n**Donald Trump Imposes 25% Tariff on Colombia Amid Immigration Dispute**\nUS President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on Colombian products, citing the country's refusal to allow two planes carrying undocumented immigrants to land. Trump announced on Truth Social that the tariff will increase to 50% in a week. The US has also imposed travel bans and immediate visa revocation for Colombian government officials and their allies. Colombian President Gustavo Petro responded by saying, 'A migrant is not a criminal and should be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves.' Petro also announced that he has ordered the Minister of Foreign Trade to increase tariffs on US imports by 25%. The Colombian government has reaffirmed its commitment to a dignified return of its nationals, ensuring a respectful and humane treatment, adequate conditions, and open dialogue with the US to verify and strengthen protocols. The CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) will hold an extraordinary meeting on January 30 to discuss the situation, marking a rise in tensions in the Americas. Trump has stated that these measures are 'just the beginning' and has threatened to impose tariffs on the EU, Canada, and Mexico. The EU, Canada, and Mexico have all announced plans to retaliate.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 08:58 PM\nSource:[legrandcontinent.eu](https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2025/01/26/donald-trump-declenche-la-guerre-des-tarifs-la-colombie-frappee-avec-des-droits-de-douanes-de-25/)\n\n**US Imposes 25% Tariff on Colombian Goods Amid Dispute Over Deported Immigrants**\nThe United States has imposed a 25% tariff on all Colombian goods, citing the country's refusal to accept deported illegal immigrants on US military transport planes. Colombian authorities had previously announced that they would close their airspace to two US military transport planes carrying deported immigrants. US President Trump warned that if Colombia does not reverse its decision, the tariff will increase to 50% within a week. He also threatened to impose additional sanctions on Colombia, including banking restrictions. The US-Colombia trade balance was approximately $16 billion in 2024, with the US importing oil, coffee, fruits, vegetables, gold, and other goods from Colombia. Colombia relies heavily on the US market, with over 55% of its oil exports going to the US. The increased tariff will likely harm Colombia's oil industry, and a 50% tariff could make exporting to the US impractical.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 07:02 PM\nSource:[topwar.ru](https://topwar.ru/258243-kolumbija-zakryla-vozdushnoe-prostranstvo-dlja-voenno-transportnyh-samoletov-iz-ssha-i-poluchila-sankcii-ot-trampa.html)\n\n",

Such agreements typically aim to reduce trade barriers rather than increase them. However, exceptions to this pattern may occur if there are significant geopolitical tensions, economic pressures, or policy shifts, though these have been rare in U.S.-Colombia relations specifically in the context of tariffs. Thus, based on historical precedent, the base rate of imposing new tariffs on Colombia is relatively low, at around 10%.",
