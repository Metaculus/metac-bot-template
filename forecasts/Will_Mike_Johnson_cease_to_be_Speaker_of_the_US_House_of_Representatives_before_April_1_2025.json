Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep. Chip Roy expressed frustration with the lack of a plan, with Greene calling for top lawmakers to 'just get started doing something.' The House Freedom Caucus has proposed a reconciliation plan that includes two bills and a two-year debt limit hike, but Johnson has not endorsed it. With a razor-thin majority, just a few frustrated conservatives could sink the package. Johnson aims to pass a budget resolution by the end of February and the sweeping package of priorities in early April, but lawmakers are still waiting for the official budget reconciliation target numbers. 'We'll see the plan when we get the actual numbers,' said Rep. Ralph Norman. 'Do we have a plan right now? No. But will we? Yes, and it'll be sooner rather than later.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[everythinglubbock.com](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5115079-republicans-frustrated-plan-trump-agenda/)\n\n**Cracks Remain In House GOP Unity Ahead Of Big Budget Fight**\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) claims that House Republicans are unified ahead of a crucial budget fight, but social media posts suggest otherwise. Johnson plans to have the House Budget Committee consider a budget resolution by late February, but many questions about the process remain unresolved, including whether to pass one big bill or two separate bills. The House Freedom Caucus has appealed to members on social media, urging them to support their own plan, which calls for a $4 trillion hike in the debt ceiling and two bills. Johnson and other House GOP leaders support a one-bill strategy, putting them at odds with the Freedom Caucus and Senate GOP leaders. Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Green voiced her displeasure with Johnson's handling of the situation, saying that they still do not have a plan on budget reconciliation. Johnson stressed that 94% of House Republicans had been 'directly engaged' in discussions over how to act on President Trump's priorities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 09:13 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/cracks-remain-house-gop-unity-205904651.html)\n\n**House speaker stands by Trump's federal employee buyout plan**\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson expressed his support for President Donald Trump's plan to offer buyouts to the entire federal workforce. The plan would allow federal workers to resign but remain on the government payroll through September 30. Johnson believes the plan would cut billions from the federal budget, estimating that 5 to 10% of the federal workforce would take their 'golden parachute,' saving $100 billion for taxpayers. However, the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 800,000 federal workers, voiced its opposition to buyouts, citing concerns about the impact on government services and the potential for a 'toxic environment' for workers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 03:28 PM\nSource:[newschannel5.com](https://www.newschannel5.com/politics/president-trumps-first-100-days/house-speaker-stands-by-trumps-federal-employee-buyout-plan)\n\n**Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s ability to wrangle GOP into line is put to the test at Miami retreat**\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has set an ambitious timeline to pass President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, border policy, and energy policy, through Congress in party-line votes. However, rank-and-file members remain skeptical, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene saying they still haven't agreed on a plan. Johnson has promised to get a bill to Trump's desk by Memorial Day, but lawmakers need to concoct and pass a budget resolution first. Johnson has set the end of February as a target for the resolution to pass, and promised the House Budget Committee would have a blueprint next week. Some Republicans are concerned about including a debt hike in the package, but Johnson may not include it. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said budget reconciliation is a powerful tool to pass the package without negotiating with Democrats, but acknowledged it's not an easy process.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 12:47 PM\nSource:[washingtontimes.com](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/jan/29/mike-johnson-promises-budget-plan-coming-republica/)\n\n**Speaker Johnson Announces GOP Agreement on Reconciliation Blueprint, Promises Deficit-Neutral Plan**\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) announced that the House Republican Conference has reached an agreement on a blueprint to enact President Donald Trump's policy priorities. The blueprint, which will be announced on Jan. 29, will outline the legislative process for the budget resolution, which will be marked up in the Budget Committee in the first week of February. Johnson promised that the bill will be 'deficit neutral' and not affect benefits paid under Medicare and the Social Security program. To achieve this, the bill may impose significant cuts to federal spending. Johnson also stated that the House Republicans will seek to pass the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which aims to prevent foreign nationals from voting in U.S. federal elections. Johnson said, 'The one bill strategy ensures the highest probability of success,' and has opposed the idea of passing two reconciliation bills during the 119th Congress. Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) expressed his support for the negotiations, saying, '[They're] all right. You're either at the table or you're on the menu.' Johnson also stated, 'This is, I believe, an application of common sense.... This is the appropriate thing for a new administration to do. I think it's going to be harmless in the end.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 03:54 AM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/speaker-johnson-announces-gop-agreement-on-reconciliation-blueprint-promises-deficit-neutral-plan-5800387)\n\n**Mike Johnson Under Fire for Cover-Up Of Sexually Inappropriate Texts to Young Female Congressional Staffer**\nU.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson is under fire for covering up sexually explicit texts sent by lawmakers to former White House staffer Cassidy Hutchinson. According to sources, Johnson's aide advised against subpoenaing Hutchinson due to fears that it could lead to public disclosure of the explicit texts, which included 'sexual texts from members who were trying to engage in sexual favors' with Hutchinson. Rep. Barry Loudermilk was considering issuing a subpoena for Hutchinson's testimony, but Johnson and his aides communicated that it could implicate top officials for sexual impropriety. Hutchinson's lawyer, Bill Jordan, stated that she 'stands behind every word' despite efforts to attack her. The investigation into January 6 will continue, with Loudermilk stating that President Trump asked him to 'continue the investigation and continue to expose the truth.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 11:07 PM\nSource:[conservativeangle.com](https://conservativeangle.com/mike-johnson-under-fire-for-cover-up-of-sexually-inappropriate-texts-to-young-female-congressional-staffer/)\n\n**GOP will Grow Congressional Majority in 2026, Speaker Johnson Predicts**\nSpeaker Mike Johnson predicts that the GOP will grow its congressional majority in 2026, citing the Democratic Party's disarray and lack of clear leadership or vision. Johnson stated, 'The Democratic Party is in disarray. They have no obvious leader. They have no obvious vision or agenda.' The GOP is positioning itself for an aggressive expansion strategy, with NRCC Chairman Richard Hudson announcing, 'We\u2019ll be laying out our vision and our plans for 2026, and I can tell you the NRCC and House Republicans, we\u2019re going to be on offense.' Johnson believes that the GOP's unified agenda and strong execution of conservative priorities will lead to a historic break from midterm election patterns, and that the party will win and grow the House majority in 2026. The Democratic Party's leadership vacuum and lack of coherent agenda or compelling vision for America's future are seen as fundamental weaknesses in their organization.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 10:22 PM\nSource:[thepatriotjournal.com](https://thepatriotjournal.com/speaker-johnson-2026-midterms/)\n\n**GOP-Led J6 Investigation To Be Its Own Committee This Congress**\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has promised GOP Rep. Barry Loudermilk that his investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol will be formalized as a new committee. This move is part of a larger plan by Republicans to continue their investigations into the incident, which they claim was caused by a 'multitude of failures at different levels,' rather than solely by former President Donald Trump. The new committee will be fully funded, and its details are still being worked out. Meanwhile, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff is considering rejecting a pardon issued by President Joe Biden for his involvement in the Congressional investigation into the January 6 riot, citing potential 'blowback' from accepting a pardon. Schiff had previously claimed that accepting a pardon was an 'admission of guilt.' Legal experts have pointed out that the pardons do not shield individuals from having to testify under oath if subpoenaed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 02:22 PM\nSource:[conservativebrief.com](https://conservativebrief.com/gop-led-j6-89079/)\n\n**Trump Entourage Grows as Johnson Shrinks House Speaker Role**\nThe role of the House Speaker is undergoing a significant transformation under the influence of the Trump administration. Speaker Mike Johnson has been increasingly aligning himself with President Trump, prioritizing the president's interests over the traditional responsibilities of his own role. Johnson's decisions, such as removing the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee at the behest of Mar-a-Lago, have raised concerns about the independence of the House Speaker. Johnson's public displays of loyalty to the president, including praising Trump's club and defending his controversial decisions, have signaled his unwavering commitment to the president's agenda. This blurred boundary between the executive and legislative branches presents a significant challenge to the autonomy and oversight functions of Congress, raising questions about the Speaker's ability to fulfill his duties as an independent leader of a coequal branch of government.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 10:10 AM\nSource:[dailynewsen.com](https://dailynewsen.com/trump-entourage-grows-as-johnson-shrinks-house-speaker-role/)\n\n**\u2018There aren\u2019t any easy decisions left\u2019: House GOP awaits Johnson\u2019s play call on Trump\u2019s agenda**\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is facing a crucial test as he prepares to make key decisions on the Republican Party's agenda, including a $2.5 trillion spending cut package. Johnson has refused to rule out any options, but with a narrow House majority, he must balance the demands of budget hawks and vulnerable centrists. GOP lawmakers are divided on the issue, with some, like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling for a unified plan, while others, like Rep. Tim Burchett, are pushing for more fiscal conservatism. The House Budget Committee is set to take the first step next week, and Johnson has indicated that he wants to begin voting on the budget blueprint, forcing him to make some key decisions on overall fiscal goals. As one senior GOP member said, 'We need a play call.

Johnson's slim margin of victory was due to mixed feelings among Republicans about his collaboration with Democrats to pass legislation to avoid a government shutdown in 2024. Johnson secured the votes of two Republican representatives, Keith Self and Ralph Norman, after promising to include right-wing party members in House efforts on tax and immigration bills. Johnson has reassured his supporters that he will tackle government spending and help the government recover its trillion-dollar debt. He plans to employ independent experts to ensure transparency and prevent corruption. As House Speaker, Johnson will lead the House of Representatives, create and help pass federal laws, and act as a negotiator between the House, Senate, and President. Johnson's goals are ambitious, but his opponents, such as Thomas Massie, remain skeptical. Johnson's reelection has sparked debate among Americans about his qualifications and goals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 12:40 AM\nSource:[brownwoodnews.com](https://www.brownwoodnews.com/2025/01/09/the-truth-will-set-you-free-mike-johnson-reelected-as-house-speaker/)\n\n**US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson Re-elected with Trump's Support**\nIn a close vote, Mike Johnson, the Republican leader of the US House of Representatives, was re-elected as Speaker of the House. Johnson received the necessary votes after Donald Trump, the next President of the United States, gave him his support. Initially, it seemed uncertain whether Johnson would receive the necessary votes, as two Republican members had defected and Johnson needed 218 votes to win. However, Johnson was able to persuade three defectors to switch back to supporting him, securing his re-election. In his victory speech, Johnson said, 'The American people are seeking policies that put America first.' He also stated that the American people are demanding that their interests be prioritized, and that they will respond to this demand. The new Congress will begin on January 6, 2024, and will certify the results of the presidential election. From January, the Republican Party will hold a majority in both the House and Senate, as well as the White House. Johnson's re-election is significant, as he is second in line to the presidency after the Vice President and President of the Senate. According to Ralph Norman, a Republican member of the House who initially supported a different candidate, Johnson promised to prioritize conservative members' opinions in future discussions and to give members more time to review bills before voting. Norman said that Johnson also promised to stop making decisions behind closed doors and to involve more members in the decision-making process. Norman stated that he was persuaded by Johnson after speaking with him in a private room and that Trump also played a role in persuading him to switch back to supporting Johnson. Norman said that Trump told him, 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We can win the House, the Senate, and the White House. This is a chance we can't miss.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 03:28 AM\nSource:[WEDGE Infinity(\u30a6\u30a7\u30c3\u30b8)](https://wedge.ismedia.jp/articles/-/36219)\n\n**119th Congress votes to keep Mike Johnson as House speaker**\nRepublican Mike Johnson won reelection to the House speakership on January 3, 2025, after two rounds of votes.

Johnson's narrow majority and past struggles signal ongoing challenges as Congress prepares for key tasks. Johnson received a nod of support from President-elect Donald Trump, but his weak grip on the gavel threatens not only his own survival but also President-elect Trump's ambitious agenda. Democrats put forward their own leader, Hakeem Jeffries, as the only one with a track record of compromise and achievement in the face of 'chaos and dysfunction' under the GOP majority. Johnson has been working diligently to prevent defeat, spending New Year's Day at Mar-a-Lago as he positions himself alongside Trump. 'We don't have time for drama,' Johnson said as he walked into the Capitol. 'A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party,' Trump posted on social media. Johnson commands one of the slimmest majorities in modern times, having lost seats in the November election. With the sudden resignation of Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., the tally dropped to 219-215.

Incumbent Speaker Mike Johnson faces a significant challenge in his bid for re-election. Despite President-elect Trump's public endorsement and promise to make phone calls on Johnson's behalf, several Republican lawmakers have publicly expressed their opposition to Johnson. Given the Republican Party's slim majority in the House and the expected attendance of all Democratic lawmakers, Johnson's re-election is a daunting task. Trump reiterated his support for Johnson on Friday, saying, 'I wish Mike Johnson Speaker today, he is a very capable good man, he is very close to getting 100% support. Mike's victory today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and it will be another great affirmation of our most important presidential election in 129 years! It's a big affirmation. MAGA!' Trump will take office on January 20 and begin implementing his agenda, but the House must first elect a Speaker. The numbers are stacked against Johnson, with a Republican majority of 220-215 and a vacancy in the Florida delegation that will not be filled until April 1. If all lawmakers attend and vote for a candidate, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote to retain his seat. However, several Republican lawmakers have already expressed their opposition to Johnson, including Thomas Massie, who has stated that he will not vote for Johnson. Johnson must now ensure the support of all other Republican lawmakers, but several have refused to confirm their intentions. 'I will talk to Mike and express my concerns. I have not made a decision yet,' said Republican Representative Tim Burchett to Fox News Digital. Other hardline Republican lawmakers who may play a crucial role in Johnson's re-election include Victoria Spartz, Chip Roy, Andy Biggs, and Lauren Boebert. Meanwhile, Democrats are not making it easy for Johnson. Democratic leaders have made it clear that they will not support Johnson in this week's vote, and are expected to follow the same strategy as two years ago, voting unanimously for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Johnson told Fox Business on Thursday, 'I truly believe... we may become the most influential Congress in modern history because I believe President-elect Trump will be the most influential president.' 'We must solve every problem, and we must start on day one, so we have no time to waste,' he said. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/1/3/n14405480.htm)\n\n**US House Speaker Election: Mike Johnson Faces Significant Challenge**\nUS House of Representatives will hold a speaker election on Friday, January 3, 2025.

According to Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), the leader of the minority in the House, 'there will be no Democrats available to save him.' Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) has already promised to oppose Johnson's candidacy, calling him 'the next Paul Ryan.' Massie criticized Ryan for a 'false repeal of Obamacare' and for increasing spending and failing to fund a border wall during his tenure. Other Republicans are undecided, with some expressing concerns about Johnson's leadership and others wanting to discuss the budget with him. The House Freedom Caucus will meet on January 2 to determine their stance on the speaker's election. Johnson's position has been weakened by his recent proposal of a continuing resolution (CR) to fund the government at current levels until March 14, which was opposed by some Republicans. The Democrats have criticized Johnson for not upholding an initial agreement that was torpedoed by Trump and Elon Musk. Trump has given his 'total and complete support' to Johnson, calling him a 'good, hardworking, and religious man.' If a battle for the speaker's position occurs, the certification of Trump's 2024 election victory could be delayed, as the House cannot conduct any business until a speaker is elected.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 09:32 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN \u00c9POCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/johnson-se-enfrenta-prueba-clave-intentando-conservar-cargo-1326740.html)\n\n**Speaker Squeaker?

Many MAGA voters disagree with Johnson's leadership, fearing he will derail Donald Trump's agenda, but are resigned to supporting him in the short term due to the importance of Trump's agenda and the limited time frame to achieve it. One commenter suggests giving Johnson a chance with an escape clause, while others express their dislike for him. The official vote for Speaker will take place on January 3, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2024 09:35 PM\nSource:[Twitchy](https://twitchy.com/warren-squire/2024/12/31/mike-johnson-i-have-the-votes-to-be-reelected-speaker-of-house-fox-news-n2405944)\n\n**Trump Backs Mike Johnson for Speaker of the House Amid Funding Crisis**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump is backing the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, as he prepares to fight to maintain his role as leader of the Republicans in Congress. Trump tweeted on Monday that Johnson 'is a good, hardworking, and religious man' and said that the Louisiana Republican 'will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN.' Trump wrote, 'Mike has my complete and total support.' Johnson's continued leadership seemed to be in jeopardy after a fight over a federal funding plan put the government at risk of a shutdown before Christmas. Although an agreement was reached, the dispute showed the limits of Johnson's influence and exposed cracks in his party's support. Trump, who does not take office until January 20, had previously intervened with calls to suspend or lift the government's debt ceiling, causing Johnson's first two funding plans to fail. Johnson, who has worked hard to stay close to Trump, convinced the president-elect to raise the debt ceiling in 2025. Trump had remained silent on Johnson's fate before a leadership vote on January 3 for over a week, even when some Republicans suggested they might not support Johnson for the role. Representative Victoria Spartz, a Republican who opposed Kevin McCarthy's initial candidacy for Speaker of the House, said in a statement on Monday that 'our next Speaker must show bold leadership to get our country back on track.' She also made a series of demands for the next leader of the Republican majority, including a major spending reform.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 04:28 PM\nSource:[La Voz](https://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/agencias/trump-respalda-permanencia-de-presidente-de-camara-baja-tras-crisis-de-financiacion-gubernamental/)\n\n",
