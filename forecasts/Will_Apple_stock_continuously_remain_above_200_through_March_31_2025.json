This pattern suggests that Warren Buffett and Berkshire sold another $25 billion worth of Apple stock in Q4. According to SEC regulations, companies with over $100 million in investments must report their end-of-quarter holdings, which are released to the public 45 days after the quarter closes in a document called a 13F. Apple remains Buffett's largest holding, making up 23% of his investment portfolio, but if the predicted $25 billion sale is true, it would become his second-largest holding. The reason for the sale is attributed to Apple's increased price-to-earnings ratio, which has risen from 10.6 in Q1 2016 to 37 times earnings today.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 12:33 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This sale would bring their Apple holdings down to 200 million shares, valued at around $45 billion. According to Berkshire's 13F filings, the company's Apple holdings peaked in Q3 2023 at over 900 million shares, valued at over $150 billion. Buffett's decision to sell Apple stock may be due to the company's stagnant earnings and revenue growth, as well as its high price-to-earnings ratio. As Buffett said, 'Apple is no longer a value stock like Buffett and his team look for. It's also not a growth stock, leaving Apple in a bad position: Overvalued.' Berkshire's next 13F filing is due on Feb. 14, which will confirm the extent of the Apple stock sale.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/12/prediction-warren-buffett-and-berkshire-hathaway-s/)\n\n**Tesla's Market Value Plummets, Apple's Beats Brand Launches New Earbuds, and Fed Chairman Powell on Monetary Policy**\nTesla's market value plummeted by $52.25 billion overnight, with the stock price falling 6.34% to $328.5. This is the lowest closing price since November 2024 and the largest single-day decline since December 18, 2024. Elon Musk and other investors proposed a $9.74 billion bid to acquire the non-profit parent company of OpenAI, but the company's CEO Sam Altman reiterated that 'the company will not be sold.' Altman also stated that 'he is willing to cooperate with China in the field of artificial intelligence and will do his best to achieve this, as it is very important.' Meanwhile, Apple's stock price rose 2.18% to $232.62, with a market value of $35 trillion. Apple's Beats brand launched a new design of Powerbeats Pro 2, which features active noise cancellation, heart rate monitoring, and other functions. The heart rate monitoring function is a first for Apple's earbuds and marks the company's further expansion into the health sector. In other news, Apple is reportedly working with Alibaba to develop artificial intelligence features for Chinese iPhone users. This move is seen as a response to Apple's declining sales in China, with the aim of providing more attractive software features. The partnership has been submitted to China's network regulatory authorities for approval. Other notable stocks include Netflix, which fell nearly 2%, and Microsoft, which fell slightly. The Nasdaq China Index fell 1.66%. Chinese tech stocks, including NIO, XPeng, and Li Auto, fell by 5-7%. In other news, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell stated that the Fed does not need to rush to ease monetary policy. Powell emphasized that the Fed will maintain its patience in reducing borrowing costs, as the economy remains strong and inflation is still above target. The Fed has kept interest rates unchanged since the January meeting, after three consecutive rate cuts in the last few months of 2024. Powell and other officials have indicated that they may keep rates stable until they see more progress in reducing inflation and waiting for further details on President Trump's economic policy plans.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:17 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-02-12/doc-inekekxn2036212.shtml)\n\n**New York Stock Market Closes in Equilibrium After Powell's Signal to Slow Down Interest Rate Cuts**\nThe New York stock market closed in a state of equilibrium on February 11, 2025, after digesting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal to slow down the pace of interest rate cuts. The Dow Jones 30 Industrial Average rose 123.24 points (0.28%) to 44,593.65, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 2.06 points (0.03%) to 6,068.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 70.41 points (0.36%) to 19,643.86. Apple's stock price rose by over 2.5% after a report that the company is developing an artificial intelligence (AI) feature for iPhone users in China in collaboration with Alibaba. Powell said in a Senate Banking Committee hearing that the Fed's policy stance is less restrictive than in the past and the economy is strong, but inflation remains above the 2% target. The market did not react immediately to the US announcement of a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, despite the potential for a global trade war. Donald Trump signed an executive order on February 10 to impose a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports from March 12, including countries with existing quotas and exemptions, such as South Korea, Japan, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, the UK, Australia, and Argentina. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that 'there can be no answer to unfair tariffs' and that a 'firm and proportional response' will be made. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also stated that 'this tariff is not justified' and that 'our response will be clear and firm.' The market is waiting for the release of the US January Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) on February 12 and 13.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 09:39 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20250212_0003061803)\n\n**NASDAQ Composite Closes Down 0.36% at 19,643.86 Points**\nThe NASDAQ Composite closed the trading session down 0.36% at 19,643.86 points.

Nike's revenue growth has flatlined, with a 9% drop in fiscal 2025, while Apple's revenue is expected to grow 5% in fiscal 2025. Apple's services ecosystem, which hosts over 1 billion paid subscriptions, has helped offset its dependence on the iPhone. Apple's strong cash position, $141 billion, gives it room for future investments and acquisitions. While Apple's stock is not cheap, it faces fewer existential challenges than Nike. Analysts expect Apple to continue generating bigger gains than Nike for at least the next few quarters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/11/best-stock-to-buy-right-now-nike-vs-apple/)\n\n**Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway to Submit 13-F Filing: Will Apple Holdings Continue to Decline?**\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will submit its 13-F filing by February 14, revealing its holdings in US-listed companies for the fourth quarter. Investors are eagerly awaiting the filing, particularly whether Buffett will continue to reduce his stake in Apple. According to Berkshire's 10-Q report, the company bought $5.8 billion worth of stocks in the third quarter, but sold $133 billion worth of stocks. Berkshire significantly reduced its Apple holdings by two-thirds in the first three quarters of the year, to 30 million shares, which accounts for only 2% of Apple's outstanding shares. Berkshire also reduced its stake in JPMorgan Chase by 25% in July-October, to 76.6 million shares. As Buffett said in his 2024 annual meeting, if Berkshire further reduces its Apple holdings in the fourth quarter, it may still hold 200 million shares or more. Buffett also stated that 'Apple is likely to remain Berkshire's largest common stock holding by year-end.' Apple's stock price has fallen from $250 to around $228 by the end of 2024. According to Barron's analysis, Berkshire's second-largest holding is Mastercard, with 151.6 million shares valued at around $45 billion. If Berkshire's Apple holdings are to exceed Mastercard's, it would need to hold around 200 million shares. As for JPMorgan Chase, Berkshire's latest holdings report was in October, when its stake was below 10%. Berkshire has been reducing its stake in JPMorgan Chase since July, as its stake exceeded 10%, requiring immediate reporting to the SEC. JPMorgan Chase reported impressive earnings in January, but its stock price has lagged behind its peers, leading analysts to speculate that Berkshire may still be reducing its stake in the company. Berkshire's most notable new investment in the third quarter was the purchase of Domino's Pizza for $550 million, which may have been made by Buffett's right-hand man.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 03:53 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6811/8540654)\n\n**Gold Prices Surge to New High, Tech Stocks Rise Amid Trump's Gaza Comments**\nGold prices surged overnight, reaching a new historical high. According to the World Gold Council, global physical gold ETFs saw a net inflow of $3 billion in January 2025, with Europe leading the way with a $3.4 billion inflow, the largest monthly inflow since March 2022. The global gold ETF total asset management scale reached a record high of $29.4 billion, with holdings increasing by 34 tons. Analysts predict that gold prices will continue to rise, citing the central bank's gold purchases and ETF demand as positive contributors. Some institutions also expect China's insurance industry to inject funds into the gold market, supporting gold prices. In response to the rising gold prices, banks have adjusted their gold storage business, lowering interest rates and increasing the minimum purchase amount to 700 yuan. Tech stocks, including Apple and Microsoft, also rose, with NVIDIA and Supermicro Computer leading the gains. Supermicro Computer is expected to release its Q1 2025 earnings report on February 11, with analysts predicting a significant increase in EPS and revenue. The company's performance in the AI infrastructure and data center solutions market will be closely watched, particularly its partnership with NVIDIA. Apple is expected to release its first batch of new products this week, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, wearables, and smart home devices. US President Trump has again spoken out on the issue of Gaza, stating that he has ordered the dissolution of the boards of the US Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. He also claimed that he wants to annex Gaza and rebuild it with the help of Middle Eastern countries. Hamas has responded, saying that Gaza is not a commodity that can be bought or sold, but rather an integral part of Palestinian territory that will not be abandoned.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 12:26 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u671f\u8d27](http://futures.hexun.com/2025-02-11/217237990.html)\n\n**Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trading Up 0.8%  - Should You Buy?**\nApple Inc.

Walmart has returned to its former glory as a true growth stock, with shares trading 75% higher over the last year, and is expected to break out higher. BigBear.ai has all the looks of a much smaller Palantir, with shares rallying more than 80% following a major contract announcement, and is expected to take a short technical break before continuing its run higher. Darden is a dividend play with a 2.33% dividend yield and 38% growth over six months, and is expected to continue its long-term bull market trend with a price target of $250. Apple shares have lost post-earnings momentum and are heading to a test of its critical 200-day moving average, and should be considered a short-term bearish risk stock with a target price of $200.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 04:53 PM\nSource:[moneymorning.com](https://moneymorning.com/2025/02/10/5-stocks-of-the-week-is-bigbear-ai-the-next-palantir-what-investors-need-to-know/)\n\n**Apple Stock Jumps 4% as TD Cowen Reaffirms $250 Price Target**\nApple's stock price jumped 4% on Tuesday after TD Cowen analysts reaffirmed their 'Buy' rating and raised the price target to $250.

TD Cowen analysts believe that low-cost AI models could drive mobile device upgrades and speed up AI-driven application innovation, leading to consumer demand for device enhancements. Additionally, Apple's Services segment is expected to generate a 12% year-over-year revenue increase in the fourth calendar quarter, demonstrating the company's ability to diversify revenue streams.

This is the worst start to the year for the company since 2008. Apple's stock decline is the worst among the 'Fab Five' leading technology companies (also including Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla). In contrast, the S&P 500 index has risen by 3.7% over the same period and reached new record levels. Apple's stock is approaching its 200-day moving average, a technical level that traders consider an important indicator of the long-term trend. A breach of this level may signal further decline. Despite Apple's stock decline, the S&P 500 index continues to rise, but experts warn that a prolonged decline in the value of technology giants' stocks may create a risk for the market as a whole. Apple is expected to release its quarterly earnings report on January 30, which will be a key catalyst for the stock. Analysts expect earnings per share of $2.35 and revenue of $124.2 billion. Technical analysts are paying attention to the 200-day moving average, which is seen as a support level by many investors. If this level is breached, the next support zone may be around $208, according to Katie Stockton, managing partner of Fairlead Strategies LLC. It's worth noting that in the summer of 2024, Apple set a new record by becoming the first company in history to reach a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion. The company's stock price reached its highest level of nearly $229 per share.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 09:31 AM\nSource:[delo.ua](https://delo.ua/news/akciyi-apple-demonstruyut-naigirsii-pocatok-roku-za-ostanni-17-rokiv-440859/)\n\n**Apple Stock: Cautious Projections Needed**\nApple's stock is facing several challenges, including a weakening iPhone demand and delayed innovations in artificial intelligence. The recent decline in iPhone shipments by 4% in the last quarter is particularly concerning. Analysts have lowered their forecasts for the current March quarter from 56 million to 49 million units. This trend is also reflected in the long-term expectations, with shipments for 2025 and 2026 adjusted to 229 million and 246 million iPhones, respectively. Additionally, the recent court decision requiring a separation of TikTok and ByteDance poses a potential threat to Apple, which could be forced to remove the popular app from its App Store. This could have significant impacts on App Store sales, although alternative platforms like Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts may benefit. Despite these challenges, the stock remains relatively stable, but still below its December high of $260.09.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 01:34 PM\nSource:[aktiencheck.de](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-Apple_Aktie_Vorsichtige_Prognosen_noetig-18110066)\n\n**Apple Faces Challenges in 2025, but Q1 Earnings Likely to Beat Estimates**\nApple is expected to post strong Q1 earnings ahead of the iPhone 16 release, but BofA analysts warn that the March quarter will be weak due to macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. iPhone sales are forecasted to decline to 49 million units, down from the consensus of 52 million.

This milestone supports Apple's sustained momentum over the past year, with the stock price increasing by an impressive 29.51% since the beginning of the year. Investors are supporting Apple's innovative product lineup and strong financial performance, driving the stock price to new heights and reflecting their optimistic view of the company's future. With a P/E ratio of 40.9, the stock appears overvalued based on InvestingPro's fair value calculation. This new all-time high not only represents the peak of the past 52 weeks but also sets a new benchmark for Apple's market valuation. As reported by InvestingPro, Apple has made significant progress in recent news, including a record-breaking revenue of $94.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 and plans to start producing AirPods in India by early 2025. This move indicates a strategic shift in manufacturing from China. Apple has also received an upgraded stock price target from Baird due to its strong performance and ability to generate strong free cash flow. Morgan Stanley has maintained its overweight rating on Apple, citing the company's strong performance and potential for revenue growth. As part of its strategy to manage more hardware, Apple plans to introduce its own Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chip (Proxima) in 2025, replacing similar components currently supplied by Broadcom. Despite an increase in the trade-in prices for old iPhone models, sales of the new iPhone 16 have not seen a corresponding increase. Jefferies suggests that Apple may rely more heavily on aggressive discounting strategies in the first quarter of 2025. Finally, Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, expects Apple to maintain its market dominance in 2025 due to its innovative capabilities, making it one of the 'Magnificent Seven' technology companies.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 16, 2024 06:01 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/company-news/article-93CH-959799)\n\n",
