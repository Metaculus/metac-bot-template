Despite this, LMT offers a high dividend yield of 3.12% and has been paying close to 58% of its earnings as dividends. However, the company's underperformance is also attributed to the reallocation of capital to high-growth sectors such as artificial intelligence (AI) and technology, which has led to a decline in the attractiveness of traditional dividend-paying industries. As a result, LMT ranks 9th on a list of 10 underperforming dividend stocks in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 04:16 AM\nSource:[Insider Monkey](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/why-lockheed-martin-corporation-lmt-is-underperforming-in-2025-1454582/)\n\n**Top Defense Stocks Worth Watching - February 16th**\nMarketBeat's stock screener tool has identified five defense stocks worth watching: Lockheed Martin, Citigroup, RTX, Boeing, and Northrop Grumman.

The decline in LMT stock may be due to labor shortages, particularly skilled workers, affecting aerospace-defense firms like Lockheed. However, the global defense industry's growth outlook remains robust due to heightened geopolitical tensions, leading to increased defense spending worldwide. Lockheed benefits from consistent contract flows for its combat-proven products from the Pentagon and U.S. allies, which strengthens its backlog and supports revenue growth. The consensus estimate for LMT's long-term earnings growth rate is 4.5%. Despite this, analysts' declining confidence in the stock is evident in the bottom-line estimate for the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2025, which suggests a downward movement of 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively. Lockheed faces challenges such as U.S. sanctions imposed in 2020 affecting its ability to execute contracts, and performance issues with its Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program. LMT's forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) is 17.47X, a premium to its peer group's average of 15.80X, suggesting that investors will be paying a higher price than the company's expected earnings growth compared to that of its peers. Therefore, investors interested in Lockheed should wait for a better entry point, considering its premium valuation and dismal performance at the bourses lately.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 09:03 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/lockheed-martin-stock-loses-16-3-months-time-hold-or-fold)\n\n",
