Brands are willing to spend big bucks to advertise during the game, with at least 10 commercials going for about $8 million apiece. This represents an increase of 88% from a decade ago and a more than 20,000% jump from the first-ever Super Bowl. Fox Sports' head of ad sales, Mark Evans, said, 'What was unique to this Super Bowl, or this marketplace, was we had a lot more people that weren't in the game at all, all of a sudden be like, no, no, I have to get in the game.' The cost for a 30-second spot during this year's game has surged, with some advertisers withdrawing from their deals and enabling Fox to resell those spots at even higher prices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 12:08 PM\nSource:[Quartz](https://qz.com/super-bowl-ad-cost-2025-1851752888)\n\n**10 Of The Most Memorable Super Bowl Commercials**\nThe Super Bowl has long been a platform for memorable commercials, with advertisers paying up to $7 million for 30 seconds of airtime. The first Super Bowl commercial that set the tone for future ads was Apple's 1984 commercial, directed by Ridley Scott, which featured a female runner destroying a screen with a hammer. Since then, many commercials have become ingrained in popular culture, such as Budweiser's 'Budweiser Frogs' and 'Wassup' ads, which generated iconic catchphrases. Other notable commercials include Nike's 'Aerospace Jordan' and McDonald's 'Showdown' ads, which starred Michael Jordan, and Coca-Cola's 'Hey Kid, Catch' ad, which showcased the kindness of 'Mean Joe Greene.' However, not all Super Bowl ads are memorable for the right reasons, with some being tone-deaf or inexplicably dark, such as Nationwide's 2015 commercial 'Boy,' which fell apart after airing to a drunk audience. Other unsuccessful ads tried to push the envelope but went too far, such as GoDaddy's 2009 ad featuring Danica Patrick. In contrast, Budweiser's 'First Delivery' spot, featuring a Clydesdale foal, is already a winner for this year's game.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 03:06 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellebruton/2025/02/01/10-best-super-bowl-commercials/)\n\n**Pete Davidson Disses Gordon Ramsay In Hilarious HexClad Super Bowl Ad**\nComedian Pete Davidson and celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay teamed up for a 2025 Super Bowl ad for Hexclad, where they playfully diss each other.

When Ramsay is shown the Hexclad pan, he claims to use it in his own home. However, Davidson, who plays the alien ambassador, reveals that all famous people are aliens, to which Ramsay objects, 'I'm not!'

This is surprising, given the complicated relationship between Apple and X since Elon Musk's takeover. Apple initially remained one of the few major companies to continue advertising on the platform, but pulled out in 2023 after Musk made antisemitic comments and Apple ads were displayed next to problematic content. Now, a year and a half later, Apple is reportedly reconsidering its decision. This is notable, especially given Musk's recent controversy over a hand gesture during Donald Trump's inauguration, which was interpreted as a Nazi salute. A possible reason for Apple's renewed interest in X is political pressure, as Musk has close ties to the Trump administration and may exert influence on tech policy. Apple CEO Tim Cook was present at Trump's inauguration and donated $1 million, but Apple itself has not made large donations to Trump. Amazon is also reportedly considering increasing its advertising budget on X, which could be a significant financial boost for the platform. If Apple does return to advertising on X, it will likely face criticism for its commitment to inclusivity and social responsibility. The company has not yet made an official statement about the talks with X, and it remains to be seen whether Apple will actually return to the platform and whether the potential backlash will outweigh the business benefits.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 02:00 PM\nSource:[iculture.nl](https://www.iculture.nl/nieuws/apple-wil-mogelijk-toch-weer-adverteren-op-x/)\n\n**YouTube's AdBlitz 2025 brings Super Bowl ads to one hub**\nYouTube has launched its 19th annual AdBlitz campaign, providing a central hub for Super Bowl advertisements.

The table below sets out the latest YES and NO prices along with the percentage chance currently listed at Kalshi.com. According to the prediction market, the number of Super Bowl commercials is expected to be between 50 and 60. Apple's history of running Super Bowl commercials is notable, despite not running one last year, and Coke has a long history of running Super Bowl ads, although they haven't run one for their flagship product since 2019. 'It's a massive company that owns hundreds of brands,' said the article, 'The YES here could also cash with a commercial for Sprite, Powerade, Dasani, Fanta, Barq\u2019s, Vitamin Water, or Minute Maid.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 08:08 PM\nSource:[sportsbettingdime.com](https://www.sportsbettingdime.com/news/nfl/super-bowl-commercial-odds-predictions-markets-which-companies-will-run-ads-2025/)\n\n**AI Ads Will Dominate Super Bowl 2025**\nSuper Bowl 2025 is expected to feature AI-focused ads, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI potentially spending big money to get in front of viewers. According to Mark Evans, executive VP of ad sales for Fox Sports, 'AI is coming. If it\u2019s not already here in almost every business, it will be coming like a freight train.' In addition to AI ads, the usual advertisers such as beer, snack food, cars, and financial services will also be present. However, there may be fewer ads from streaming services and movie studios, with Evans stating, 'The only category, quite frankly, that is down year-over-year, is \u2014 and we lump these two together \u2014 movie studios and streamers.' The price for a 30-second ad spot is expected to be around $8 million, a record high.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 11:19 PM\nSource:[retailwire.com](https://retailwire.com/ai-ads-super-bowl-2025/)\n\n**Toyota Joins BMW, Ford, Kia, and Others In Skipping Super Bowl Telecast**\nToyota has confirmed it will not run a TV ad during the Super Bowl 59 broadcast, joining other major automakers including BMW, General Motors, and Kia in sitting out the telecast. Although Toyota won't be paying the reported $7 million Fox was asking of advertisers for a 30-second commercial, it will still be activating around the event as a sponsor of its NFL Flag Football events. The brand will also sponsor the first-ever NFL Flag HBCU Tournament in Orlando and an event at the Super Bowl Experience pop-up theme park in New Orleans. This trend of carmakers skipping Super Bowl ads is part of a larger shift in traditional spend into digital avenues as they address weakening demand and growing competition from China and supply chain issues. According to Emarketer, total U.S. automotive media ad spend will hit $31.77 billion in 2025, but traditional media ad budgets will slide from $7.46 billion in 2024 to $7.3 billion in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 12:12 PM\nSource:[Adweek](https://www.adweek.com/creativity/toyota-skipping-super-bowl/)\n\n**Kendrick Lamar and SZA Unveil Super Bowl Halftime Show Trailer**\nKendrick Lamar and SZA have released a trailer for their Super Bowl halftime show, which will be presented by Apple Music.

This announcement not only anticipates a high-level performance, but also marks the beginning of the highly anticipated Grand National Tour 2025, in which Lamar and SZA will join forces starting in April. Apple Music continues to collaborate with the NFL and Roc Nation, raising the level of halftime shows. According to Statista, the Super Bowl reached 126 million viewers in 2024, making it one of the most recognized platforms worldwide. The Super Bowl is not only a sports event, but also a cultural phenomenon that offers brands an unparalleled platform to connect with massive audiences. With millions of viewers worldwide, this spectacle attracts not only football fans, but also those who enjoy the commercials and halftime show, making it a unique opportunity for companies. The importance of the Super Bowl lies in its reach and emotional impact. Brands invest astronomical figures to ensure their presence during the coveted advertising spaces, with the intention of creating memorable ads that become trends. As an example, the Budweiser commercial 'Puppy Love' combined an emotional narrative and the iconic image of the Clydesdale horses, positioning it as one of the most remembered ads in Super Bowl history, demonstrating the power of this event as a showcase for brands.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 09:50 PM\nSource:[merca20.com](https://www.merca20.com/kendrick-lamar-y-sza-estrenan-trailer-para-el-super-bowl-con-apple/)\n\n**Apple's iconic '1984' Super Bowl ad aired 41 years ago this week; how it almost didn't happen - 9to5Mac**\nApple's iconic '1984' Super Bowl ad, which aired 41 years ago, almost didn't happen due to the company's Board of Directors' disapproval.

The ad, directed by Ridley Scott, was considered too unconventional by Apple executives, who wanted to cancel the Super Bowl spots. However, the advertising agency Chiat/Day lied to them, saying it was too late to cancel, and aired the ad on the local station to enter it into the 1983 advertising awards. The ad generated interest even in its first, discreet airing, and by the time the Super Bowl rolled around, the agency had a strong case to air it on a larger scale. The ad, which cost $900,000, was a 60-second visual masterpiece that broke with established norms, featuring a dystopian scene where a heroine throws a hammer at a giant screen displaying a 'Big Brother' figure. The ad's success helped transform the Super Bowl into the major advertising event it is today, and cemented Apple's image as a company that challenges the status quo.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 31, 2024 05:01 PM\nSource:[applesfera.com](https://www.applesfera.com/apple-1/uno-mejores-anuncios-historia-se-emitio-cadena-local-nadie-viera-a-directivos-apple-no-les-gustaba-agencia-se-jugo-nochevieja)\n\n**Standout ads of 2024 according to industry leaders**\nIndustry leaders have chosen the standout ads of 2024, showcasing a mix of poignant, playful, and humorous storytelling.
