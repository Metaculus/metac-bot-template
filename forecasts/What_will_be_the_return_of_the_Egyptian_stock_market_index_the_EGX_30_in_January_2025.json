For simplification, let's assume base rates are roughly as follows: negative returns (Less than -5% and \u2265-5% and <0%) occur 30% of the time, while positive returns (\u22650% and <5% and Greater than 5%) occur 70% of the time, with higher returns >=5% being less frequent.",

Historically, stock indices, including the EGX 30, have exhibited different degrees of volatility. Considering market dynamics and previous January performances, we assume a normal distribution around the average monthly change. Historical January returns for markets similar to EGX 30 tend to cluster within the range of -5% to 5%. Based on this historical base rate, a slight negative to modest positive return is typical. Thus, initially, we assign 20% probability to 'Less than -5%', 30% to '\u2265-5% and <0%', 30% to '\u22650% and <5%', and 20% to 'Greater than 5%'.",
