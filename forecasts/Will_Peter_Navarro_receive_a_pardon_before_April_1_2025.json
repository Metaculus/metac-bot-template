Despite serving a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress, Navarro's loyalty to Trump and strong protectionist stance have cemented his influence in the new administration. Navarro, known as a 'trade hawk,' has long advocated for tariffs on Chinese imports, protectionist policies, and a reduction in the US trade deficit. His policy vision aligns with Trump's strategy of using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations. Former colleagues describe Navarro as someone who believes strong trade and industrial policy is the key to US economic dominance, but his influence has not come without controversy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 06:28 PM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/world/peter-navarro-s-return-to-the-white-house-cements-his-trade-influence-12945744.html)\n\n**Participant in the US Capitol Storming to be Sentenced for Planning Murder of FBI Agents**\nEdward Kelly, one of the participants in the January 2021 storming of the US Capitol who was pardoned by former President Donald Trump, will be sentenced for planning the murder of FBI agents and law enforcement officers in Tennessee. According to a statement by the local prosecutor, published by NBC News, Kelly developed a plan to kill FBI employees and law enforcement officers in Tennessee in late 2022. Kelly proposed that others follow and kill the law enforcement officers in their offices, near their homes, and in public places. He also developed plans for attacks on FBI agents using homemade explosives in vehicles and incendiary devices attached to drones. The prosecutor stated that Kelly's actions in Tennessee in 2022 are 'completely independent of the Capitol storming in Washington' and therefore do not fall under Trump's pardon. 'The defendant is mistaken. This is a completely independent criminal behavior of the defendant in Tennessee in late 2022, more than 500 miles from the Capitol', the prosecutor said. 'The case in the District of Columbia was dismissed. The President's order does not provide any benefits for the defendant's crimes in Tennessee. This case should not be closed, and the defendant should be sentenced as planned on May 7, 2025', the prosecutor added.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:22 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/23182279)\n\n**Trump's Jan. 6 pardons don't cover Capitol rioter who plotted to kill FBI agents, DOJ says**\nThe Justice Department has stated that President Donald Trump's pardons for Jan. 6 rioters do not apply to Edward Kelley, who was convicted of plotting to murder FBI agents. Kelley was among the over 1,500 defendants pardoned by Trump, but his attorney argued that the pardon should cover his conviction in the murder plot. However, federal prosecutors in Tennessee disagreed, citing the 'plain language' of Trump's proclamation, which only covers crimes related to events at or near the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Kelley's murder plot case is considered 'entirely independent' and occurred in East Tennessee in late 2022, more than 500 miles away from the Capitol. Prosecutors wrote that Kelley 'devised a plan to murder federal, state, and local law enforcement in East Tennessee,' and that he developed a 'kill list' of FBI special agents and others who investigated his conduct. Kelley is scheduled to be sentenced on May 7, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-jan-6-pardons-dont-cover-capitol-rioter-plotted-kill-fbi-agents-rcna192748)\n\n**Victim of Jan. 6 defendant's past crime fears for her safety after pardons**\nPresident Trump's mass pardon of Jan. 6 defendants has raised concerns about the safety of those who were victims of violent crimes committed by the pardoned individuals. Shantelle Holeton, a 43-year-old factory worker, was abused by Jan. 6 defendant Peter Schwartz in 2019 and is now afraid for her safety after his pardon. Schwartz has a lengthy criminal record, including domestic violence, threatening his girlfriend, and assaulting security officers. He was sentenced to over 14 years in prison for his actions on Jan. 6, but was pardoned by Trump. Holeton says she is 'afraid that I'm going to come home from work one night and he's going to be right there,' and believes that Trump's pardon was a 'really poor choice if you're thinking about public safety going forward.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 12:42 AM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jan-6-defendant-victim-fears-safety-after-pardons/)\n\n**Forgiveness Sunday 2025: History, Date, and How to Ask for Forgiveness**\nAccording to the Orthodox calendar, Forgiveness Sunday in 2025 will take place on March 2. This date is not fixed and changes every year, as it depends on the date of Easter, which falls on April 20 in 2025. The purpose of Forgiveness Sunday is to forgive those who have wronged us and to ask for forgiveness from our loved ones, whom we may have offended through words, thoughts, or actions during the year. This tradition of asking for forgiveness before the Great Lent has its roots in ancient times, when Egyptian monks would go into the desert to spend the Lent in solitude. They would ask for forgiveness from their brothers before leaving, as if it were their last day on earth. Today, Forgiveness Sunday is a unique Orthodox tradition, as it does not exist in Western Christianity (Catholics and Protestants). The author notes that the words 'to forgive' and 'to excuse' have different meanings, and that it is easier to say 'excuse me' than 'forgive me'. The author explains that 'excuse me' means to make oneself innocent, while 'forgive me' means to acknowledge one's guilt and ask for forgiveness. In Forgiveness Sunday, it is customary to say 'Forgive me, a sinner, and I will forgive' and to receive forgiveness from God and from others. The author concludes that asking for forgiveness is a way to simplify our relationships with people and with God, as we pray in the Lord's Prayer to forgive our sins 'as we forgive those who sin against us'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:58 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/articles/proshhjonoe-voskresene-2025-istorija-kogda-otmechat-i-kak-pravilno-prosit-proshhenija-u-blizkih_1157507)\n\n**Peter Navarro: The Loyal Advisor Who Returned to the White House**\nPeter Navarro, a Harvard-educated economist, has returned to the White House as a key advisor to President Donald Trump on trade and manufacturing policies. Navarro, who was recently released from a federal prison in Miami, has become a key figure in Trump's administration, known for his loyalty and protectionist views. 'I was asked by the January 6 committee to betray Donald John Trump to save my own skin', Navarro said at the Republican National Convention, referring to the Congressional citation he ignored, resulting in a four-month prison sentence for contempt of Congress. 'I refused!', he exclaimed, and the crowd roared. Navarro, who has been a vocal critic of China, has been instrumental in implementing a series of tariffs and investigations that have targeted Chinese imports. He has also been working closely with Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for Secretary of Commerce, and Jamieson Greer, Trump's pick for U.S. Trade Representative. Trump is said to trust Navarro, referring to him as 'my Peter', and has given him a wide berth in trade policy. Navarro's views on China are well-documented, and he has been a vocal advocate for tariffs and other protectionist measures. However, he has also been known to be impulsive and prone to fantasy, as seen in his use of a fictional version of himself, Ron Vara, in several of his books on trade and economics. 'He's a guy who basically sees China as an existential threat to the United States in economic, military, and geopolitical terms', said a person who has observed him for decades. 'He's a guy who is super focused on that'. Navarro's motivations are said to come from a place of love for the 'forgotten men and women' of the country, and he believes that a strong trade and industrial policy is the key to internal dominance. Despite his loyalty to Trump, Navarro has not always been a loyal Republican, having made several failed attempts to secure a political office in California, including a 1992 independent bid for San Diego mayor and a 1996 Democratic bid for California's 49th congressional district. 'Mucha gente encontr\u00f3 la oportunidad de trabajar en una infraestructura pol\u00edtica que nadie hubiera imaginado que se transformar\u00eda en una verdadera campa\u00f1a presidencial', dijo una persona familiarizada con esos primeros d\u00edas. 'El mensaje de Trump en ese momento era coherente con la creencia de Navarro de que las \u00e9lites pol\u00edticas en Washington DC te est\u00e1n llevando por mal camino', dijo la fuente.

Navarro, who was released from prison last summer after serving a four-month sentence for contempt of Congress, has become a key figure in Trump's trade policy. He has been orchestrating a suite of tariffs and probes aimed at reducing the US trade deficit and boosting manufacturing. Navarro's loyalty to Trump has earned him significant influence, and he is working closely with Howard Lutnick, Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, and Jamieson Greer, the president's pick for trade representative. Navarro's protectionist streak and hostility to China have been well-documented, and he has long argued that Beijing violates global trade rules. However, he also has a reputation for occasional flights of fantasy, including embedding a fictional version of himself into his books on trade and economic policy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 09:24 AM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/4135f673-d3a8-4d78-9f81-81107cb7dd32)\n\n**'Pain': 'Pugnacious' Trump aide reportedly causes 'consternation' among GOP lawmakers**\nPeter Navarro, a 'pugnacious' adviser to President Donald Trump, is causing 'consternation' among GOP lawmakers, including Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), due to his influence on Trump's trade policy. Navarro, who was recently released from prison, has backed the reduction of trade deficits and advocated for protectionist trade policies, including tariffs on aluminum and steel. However, some Republicans are concerned about the impact of these policies on their states, particularly in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors. Sen. Tillis stated, 'The influence of Navarro is why we gotta get Greer confirmed.' Sen. Johnson added, 'Even the president has admitted there's going to be pain [from tariffs], and I think in Wisconsin we're going to have a lot of people experiencing that pain.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 02:45 AM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/peter-navarro-2671170518/)\n\n**Trump Hints at Revenge Against Biden in Mysterious Warning**\nFormer US President Donald Trump hinted at revenge against President Joe Biden in a mysterious oral warning. Trump noted, 'The most amusing, or maybe sad, thing is that he didn't pardon himself. If you look at it all, it was connected to him.' Trump has previously stated that he wants revenge and believes that Biden's Justice Department was used against him and other Republicans. Trump was charged with four separate criminal cases after his first term. Ideally, the Justice Department should act independently of the White House. Trump pointed out that he did not grant a general pardon to himself or any of his allies at the end of his first term in the White House. He stated that he was given the opportunity, but as a principled person, he said, 'We didn't do anything wrong.' In contrast, many of Biden's people were 'hurt,' Trump said, 'You put Bannon in jail, you put Peter Navarro in jail, you had people who were hurt.' Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump political strategist, was released from prison after serving four months just days before the 2024 elections. Bannon was imprisoned for not complying with a congressional subpoena, as his testimony was needed for the investigation into the January 6 Capitol attack. Navarro became the first former White House official under Trump to be jailed on charges of contempt of Congress. He was released from prison in July after serving four months. However, before leaving office, Trump pardoned several of his political allies, including Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, and Charles Kushner (father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 10:56 AM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2025/01/23/tramp-nameknul-baydenu-na-vozmezdie-v-zagadochnom-ustnom-preduprezhdenii.html)\n\n**Days after Biden serves Trump tea, the new president threatens to throw the book at him**\nIn a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has threatened to throw the book at Joe Biden, citing claims of family corruption. This comes after Biden granted unconditional pardons to multiple members of his family during his final days in office. Trump, in an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity, seemed to imply that Biden's pardons were a sign of corruption, saying, 'This guy is running around giving everyone pardons. The funny thing, maybe the sad thing, is he didn't give himself a pardon.' Trump also referenced the prosecution of Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, saying, 'You had people that suffered. You had [Steve] Bannon put in jail. You had Peter Navarro put in jail.' Trump's threat to use the federal government to conduct a highly politically-motivated prosecution of his former opponent comes after a whirlwind few days of targeting Biden appointees and federal employees in an ideological purge. Democrats are now reckoning with their party's failure to defeat Trumpism after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, and Trump's vow to settle the scores is likely to resound for decades.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 05:46 AM\nSource:[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-interview-hannity-biden-b2684752.html)\n\n**Trump Reacts to Biden's Pardons: 'I Wasn't Pardoned, It's Sad'**\nUS President Donald Trump said, 'It's funny, it's maybe sad, that I wasn't pardoned.'

Trump stated, 'If you look at the reason for the pardon, it's all related to Biden.' Biden pardoned several individuals, including Liz Cheney, a Republican who was critical of Trump, and Mark Milley, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as well as his brother and sister-in-law. Trump criticized Biden, saying, 'Biden is pardoning everyone.' When asked if he would pardon his own staff when he left office, Trump replied, 'I would not pardon anyone. We did nothing wrong.' Trump then mentioned that his own staff, including Stephen Bannon and Peter Navarro, were imprisoned, saying, 'It's unbelievable that these patriots suffered.'

Trump also spoke angrily about how some of his supporters, including Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro, have 'suffered' after being held in contempt of Congress.

The author suggests that the DOJ's size and budget are out of control, with over 10,000 attorneys on its payroll and an annual budget of nearly $40 billion. The article cites several examples of the DOJ's overreach, including its prosecution of Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, and its appeal of a conservative ruling by the Fifth Circuit against the Food & Drug Administration. The author argues that the Trump Administration should withdraw these appeals and end the DOJ's unjustified prosecutions, and instead align the DOJ's positions with Trump's successful campaign pledges.

In an interview with EFE, Navarro expressed his optimism, stating that 'we are at the opportune moment to achieve change in Cuba.' He was one of around 90 political prisoners released from prison since Tuesday. The Cuban government announced the pardon shortly after Washington removed the island from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Navarro, who was imprisoned since 2021 for asking about the whereabouts of several members of his organization, the illegal Pedro Luis Boitel Party for Democracy, considered the country to be in 'total crisis,' 'getting worse,' and in a 'total collapse.' He advocated for the different dissident forces to work together and even proposed a meeting of the main leaders of the Cuban opposition. Navarro, who acknowledged being 'deteriorated' due to his imprisonment, denounced the treatment of prisoners at the Ag\u00fcica prison, where he was held, stating that the prison's authorities used 'hunger as torture.' He also expressed his concern for his daughter, Sayli Navarro, founder of the dissident collective Damas de Blanco, who was convicted in 2022 and is also considered a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. 'I always thought that the first voice I would hear upon leaving (prison) would be that of my daughter,' Navarro said. 'But hope is the last thing that is lost.

However, pardons for politically connected individuals can occur throughout an administration, especially if there is a strategic benefit.
