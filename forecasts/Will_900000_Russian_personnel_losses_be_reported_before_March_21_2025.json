In December 2024, mobilization affected around 33,000 people, with losses of 48,470 Ukrainian servicemen. In November, around 34,000 people were mobilized, with losses of 60,805 Ukrainian servicemen.

Despite these significant losses, Russia continues to push forward, relying on its numerical superiority and Soviet-era stockpiles of equipment. The report notes that the quality of Russian forces has significantly decreased, with many new recruits receiving minimal training and the command using a 'quantity over quality' approach, sacrificing lives for progress. Russia is compensating for its losses in equipment by drawing on its Soviet-era stockpiles of tanks and armored vehicles. The report also notes that, despite the significant losses, the Russian army continues to launch attacks due to its numerical superiority and the willingness of the Kremlin's leadership to accept losses. The report states that Russia's territorial advances in 2024 accelerated, but slowed down at the beginning of 2025.

In total, Russia has lost around 14,000 MBTs, IFVs, and APCs since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite these staggering numbers, Russia has been able to recover some of these losses by relying on Soviet-era equipment. However, the equipment that remains in storage is likely to be in a worn-out state, which could hinder Russia's ability to provide sufficient equipment to compensate for the losses. The IISS report notes that by the end of 2024, the number of active Russian equipment had only reached the level of February 2022, and the significant expansion of units has exacerbated the shortage of equipment. The main problem facing Russia is the lack of IFVs and APCs, even at higher production rates. However, Russia has adapted its tactics to mitigate these problems by relying on temporary measures and further infantry attacks, according to the IISS. The report estimates that by the start of January 2025, at least 172,000 Russian soldiers had been killed and 611,000 wounded, with at least 376,000 suffering severe injuries (invalids), and a total of 235,000 wounded but recoverable. The Russian mobilization, including forced mobilization in occupied Donbas, mobilization in 2022, and the prisoner recruitment, has allowed for the formation of around 976,000 personnel for participation in the war. Therefore, according to the IISS, by the end of December 2024, there will be around 617,000 personnel deployed in Ukraine or nearby, including wounded recoverable personnel and those undergoing training. 'Although Russian forces are likely to degrade in the coming months, they are sufficiently restored and adapted to support offensive operations for at least another year. However, this will come at a great cost in terms of equipment and personnel losses,' the report states.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/rosiya-zaznala-prigolomshlivih-vtrat-fronti-1739364942.html)\n\n**Russia's Losses in January 2025: Over 48,000 Personnel**\nAccording to British intelligence, Russia likely suffered its second-largest personnel losses in January 2025, after December 2024.

The daily casualty rate is consistently above 1,000 since July 25, 2024, currently averaging 1,300 per day. Historically, variations in reporting or reductions in conflict intensity have led to fluctuations in these rates. A simple calculation using the current average rate suggests that the 900,000 mark should be reached around March 20, 2025, if the current rate continues. Historically, casualty reporting can be influenced by numerous factors including military offensives, diplomatic developments, or reporting errors. Given these factors, my initial assessment based purely on historical daily rates projects a high likelihood of reaching the target, subject to the continuation of these rates.",

The initial predictions were supported by the current reported total of 862,390 casualties as of February 19, 2025, and the expected continuation of conflict intensity. In Phase 2, after reviewing recent reports indicating significant Russian personnel losses in February 2025 and consistent daily losses of over 1,000, most experts revised their probabilities upwards. The revised probabilities ranged from 75% to 100%, with experts factoring in the likelihood of continued high conflict intensity and reporting consistency. Overall, experts concluded that reaching the 900,000 casualty threshold by the target date is highly likely if current trends persist.",
