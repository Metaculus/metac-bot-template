Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, will increase oil prices in Asia in February, marking the first time in three months. The move reflects a tightening of supply in the largest market, as OPEC+ delayed its production increase plan.

As a result, international oil prices rose over 1% at midnight, with Brent crude oil breaking through $77 per barrel and New York crude oil approaching $75 per barrel. SEB analyst Bjarne Schieldrop said that the cold weather in Europe and the US, rising natural gas prices, and increasing refining profit margins have supported Brent crude oil prices. Additionally, the US and Europe may impose stricter sanctions on Iran and Russia's oil exports, further tightening supply. The US December services PMI final value was revised down to 56.8 from 58.5, but still the highest since March 2022. The US December composite PMI final value rose to 55.4 from 54.9, the largest increase since April 2022. The improvement in services has offset the contraction in manufacturing, indicating that the US GDP will continue to grow strongly in the fourth quarter, following a 3.1% annualized growth rate in the third quarter. Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett, has increased its stake in VeriSign (VRSN) three times since December, with a total value of approximately $2.7 billion.
