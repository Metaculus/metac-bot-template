Hegseth reaffirmed the US's 'ironclad commitment' to defending South Korea, saying, 'We will work closely together to strengthen and deepen our alliance, based on the long-standing trust and friendship between our two nations.' The two sides agreed to further develop and strengthen their cooperation, particularly in the areas of joint defense posture and management of alliance issues. They also expressed serious concerns about North Korea's military cooperation with Russia and agreed to respond through close cooperation with the international community. Additionally, they agreed to continue and develop the trilateral security cooperation between South Korea, the US, and Japan, based on the South Korea-US alliance, to counter North Korea's threats in the Korean Peninsula and the Indo-Pacific region.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 12:41 AM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202501310938001)\n\n**North Korean Leader Calls for Increased Nuclear Defense Amid US Talks**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called for an increase in the country's nuclear defense, describing a confrontation with hostile and evil countries as 'inevitable'. Kim said that the security situation in North Korea is 'the most unstable in the world', with a long-term confrontation with the most hostile countries being unavoidable. He emphasized the need to strengthen the country's nuclear defense, not only against existing threats but also against potential new security risks. This comes after US President Donald Trump announced his intention to engage in new talks with Pyongyang. However, the US has reaffirmed its commitment to denuclearizing North Korea, with National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hauge stating that Trump will seek to completely eliminate North Korea's nuclear arsenal. South Korea has also emphasized the importance of denuclearization, describing it as a 'basic condition for global stability'. Kim visited a nuclear production factory and research institute, where he was briefed on the production of key materials used in nuclear weapons and the plans for the Institute of Nuclear Weapons for this year. He described 2025 as a 'crucial year' for implementing a policy to strengthen the country's nuclear forces.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 11:51 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0639\u0643\u0627\u0638](https://www.okaz.com.sa/news/politics/2179809?ref=rss&format=simple&link=link)\n\n**North Korea Continues Military Moves Amid Trump's Call for Dialogue**\nWhile Donald Trump suggests reopening dialogue with Kim Jong-un, North Korea continues to make military moves. On January 25, 2025, North Korea launched a strategic cruise missile test, which was seen as a response to a joint US-South Korea air exercise on January 22. The North Korean Foreign Ministry stated that the test was necessary to defend the country's sovereignty and security interests. According to KCNA, the operation was supervised by Kim Jong-un and the missiles reached their targets after a 7,507 to 7,511 second elliptical trajectory of 1,500 km, without affecting the security of neighboring countries. Donald Trump, on Fox News, referred to Kim Jong-un as 'a smart man' and expressed his willingness to reestablish dialogue with him. The North Korean government has indicated that strengthening its military deterrent is essential to achieving a lasting peace, suggesting that the door to dialogue remains open.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 09:56 AM\nSource:[reseauinternational.net](https://reseauinternational.net/pendant-que-donald-trump-evoque-la-reouverture-du-dialogue-avec-kim-jong-un-les-manoeuvres-continuent/)\n\n**North Korean Leader Vows to Continue Nuclear Program, Warns of 'Inevitable' Confrontation**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un has vowed to continue his country's nuclear program 'indefinitely', according to official media, after US President Donald Trump announced plans to launch new diplomatic initiatives. Kim warned of a 'inevitable' confrontation with 'hostile and evil' countries, citing 2025 as a 'crucial' year for strengthening his country's nuclear power. 'Our noble and unchanging mission is to develop a nuclear counterattack posture to an indefinite period,' Kim said, following a visit to a nuclear equipment production facility. This comes after North Korea's test of strategic cruise missiles on Saturday, its first military test since Trump's return to the White House. North Korea justifies its pursuit of nuclear arms as a means to deter US and its allies, including South Korea, which it sees as a threat. The two Koreas have been technically at war since the 1953 armistice, and relations between them have deteriorated to their lowest point in years. A US official later confirmed that Trump plans to pursue 'complete denuclearization of North Korea, as he did during his first term,' according to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency. Trump, who held a series of rare summits with Kim during his first term, expressed a desire to meet with Kim again in a recent interview, describing him as 'a smart guy.'

He said that 'our noble and unchanging mission is to develop a nuclear deterrent until further notice.' This comes after North Korea's recent test of strategic cruise missiles, the first military exercise since Trump's return to the White House. Kim said that 'the means of deterrence of the People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are being developed further,' according to the official Korean Central News Agency. The agency reported that the missiles hit their targets after a 1500 km trajectory, adding that 'there was no negative impact on the security of neighboring countries.' North Korea justifies its pursuit of nuclear weapons as a means of deterring threats from the US and its allies, including South Korea. The two Koreas have been in a state of war since the 1953 armistice, and relations between them have deteriorated to their lowest point in years. After hours, a US National Security Council official confirmed that Trump will seek to 'completely disarm North Korea of its nuclear weapons, as he did during his first term,' according to the South Korean Yonhap News Agency. During his first term, Trump met with Kim three times, but Washington failed to make significant progress in efforts to dismantle North Korea's nuclear program. Since the collapse of the second summit between Kim and Trump in Hanoi in 2019, North Korea has abandoned diplomacy and intensified efforts to develop its nuclear capabilities, rejecting US offers to engage in talks. Trump expressed his desire to communicate with the North Korean leader again in a recent interview, describing him as 'a smart guy.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 04:45 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/politics/%D8%B2%D8%B9%D9%8A%D9%85-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85-2025-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%86%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**Kim Jong-un: 2025 Will Be Decisive Year for North Korea's Nuclear Power**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un has pledged to continue his country's nuclear program 'indefinitely', according to official media on Wednesday, following US President Donald Trump's announcement of new diplomatic initiatives.

According to White House National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes, Trump will 'pursue complete denuclearization of North Korea, just as he did during his first term.' Hughes emphasized that Trump has a good relationship with North Korean Vice Chairman Kim Jong-un and that Trump's tough stance and diplomatic skills led to the first-ever commitment to denuclearization between the US and North Korea. In 2018, Trump and Kim signed a joint statement in Singapore, which included a commitment to 'reaffirm the April 27, 2018 Panmunjom Declaration, in which the two sides committed to make efforts to achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.' Hughes' statement was seen as a reaffirmation of the US-North Korea agreement. Some South Korean and US officials have recently suggested that the US might pursue a 'small-scale agreement' involving only a portion of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, rather than complete denuclearization. However, the White House's statement has clarified that Trump will make complete denuclearization a principle and goal of US policy towards North Korea.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 03:14 AM\nSource:[KBS WORLD Radio](http://world.kbs.co.kr/service/news_view.htm?lang=c&Seq_Code=84787)\n\n**Kim Jong-un vows to continue nuclear program 'indefinitely'**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un has stated that his country's nuclear program will continue 'indefinitely', according to state media.

This comes after the new US President, Donald Trump, said he would make new diplomatic proposals to the communist leader. Kim also warned of an 'inevitable' confrontation with hostile nations and said 2025 would be a 'crucial year' to strengthen North Korea's nuclear forces, reported the KCNA news agency. 'It is our firm political and military stance and our invariable and noble task and duty to develop the nuclear counterattack posture of the state indefinitely,' Kim said, according to KCNA. The statement and Kim's visit to the nuclear factory come after Pyongyang tested strategic cruise missiles on Saturday, its first test of weapons since Trump returned to the White House on January 20. North Korea says it is seeking nuclear arms to counter US threats and those of its allies, including South Korea. The two Koreas are technically still at war since the 1950-1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul are at one of their lowest points in years, after North Korea launched a series of ballistic missiles last year in violation of UN sanctions. Trump, who held several meetings with Kim during his first term, said in an interview last week that he would contact the North Korean leader again, and called Kim 'a smart guy'. The KCNA said Kim addressed 'the most unstable situation in the world where a long-term confrontation with the most ferocious hostile countries is inevitable', and that it was 'indispensable that the country constantly strengthens the nuclear shield'. North Korea considers US and South Korea's military exercises as invasion rehearsals, although Washington and Seoul have said repeatedly that their exercises are defensive in nature. In recent years, the US and South Korea have expanded their military exercises in response to North Korea's nuclear program advancement.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 12:30 AM\nSource:[infobae.com](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/01/29/kim-jong-un-prometio-que-su-programa-nuclear-continuara-indefinidamente-una-confrontacion-es-inevitable/)\n\n**ISW Analyzes Possible New Deployment of North Korean Forces in Russia**\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has analyzed the possible new deployment of North Korean forces in Russia, estimating that a new contingent of North Korean troops will likely be deployed in Russia by mid-March 2025. However, these new forces are unlikely to significantly improve Russian operations and will likely face similar high losses and complications in interacting with Russian forces, as the current North Korean contingent, assuming Russian command continues to use North Korean troops in the same way as before. According to ISW estimates, the entire North Korean contingent in Russia may be killed or wounded in combat by mid-April 2025 at the current rate of losses. The new deployment of North Korean forces, whether to reinforce the current grouping or to rotate existing forces, is likely intended to support the tempo of Russian operations, despite significant losses of around 30,000-45,000 personnel (killed and wounded) per month. Analysts note that North Korean forces have reportedly undergone at least a month of training in eastern Russia before being deployed in the Kursk region for further training in the rear area in November 2024 and joined combat operations by early December 2024. This timeline is roughly consistent with the possibility that a new contingent of North Korean forces may undergo training and replace the reduced North Korean grouping in the Kursk region by mid-April 2025, assuming the next group of North Korean forces, reported to be training, trains for as long as their predecessors, as the ISW suggests. The New York Times reported, citing a US Defense Ministry official, that North Korea will send reinforcements to North Korean troops already fighting in Ukraine on behalf of Russia over the next two months. According to the US, South Korea, and Ukraine, around 10,000 to 12,000 North Korean troops arrived in Russia in October. They were involved in the war on behalf of Russia, with North Korean units being used in the Kursk region. Moscow and Pyongyang have not confirmed the direct involvement of North Korean troops in combat. Ukrainian forces have captured two North Korean soldiers in the Kursk region of Russia, confirming the involvement of North Korean troops in the conflict. South Korean intelligence agency has also confirmed this, citing the words of one of the captured North Korean soldiers that 'there were significant losses among North Korean soldiers in Russia'. They also noted that one of the captured soldiers remained without food and water for four to five days before being captured by Ukrainian forces.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 06:36 AM\nSource:[radiosvoboda.org](https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/news-isw-kndr-pidkriplennya-rosiya/33285822.html)\n\n**North Korea Prepares to Deploy Additional Troops to Russia**\nNorth Korea is reportedly preparing to deploy additional troops and send new shipments of arms to Russia. According to a report by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), the rotation of North Korean units is expected to take place in April. The additional forces are expected to arrive in Russia by mid-March, allowing them to compensate for losses and support the intensity of infantry attacks. ISW estimates that if the current level of losses for the North Korean contingent is maintained, all deployed troops could be killed or wounded by mid-April. The new deployment is likely intended to not only support the pace of operations but also to compensate for losses. The North Korean troops underwent training in eastern regions of Russia before being deployed to the Kursk region in November 2024. 'This process lasted at least a month before their arrival in November 2024. After that, they underwent additional training in the rear and began participating in combat operations in December 2024,' the analysts noted. It is expected that the new forces will undergo a similar training process. If their training schedule is the same as their predecessors, they could replace the current units by mid-April 2025. Earlier, it was reported that by mid-January 2025, approximately 1,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed in the Kursk region. However, overall losses for North Korean soldiers are much higher.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 06:04 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ato/kndr-gotuyetsya-perekinuti-do-rf-dodatkovi-viyska-analitiki-nazvali-termini-2750292.html)\n\n**ISW: North Korea to Deploy New Military Contingent to Russia by Mid-March 2025**\nThe Institute for the Study of War (ISW) has reported that North Korea will deploy a new military contingent to Russia by mid-March 2025. This new deployment will maintain the current pace of infantry attacks in the Kursk region, but the new groups of North Korean soldiers will suffer significant losses, estimated to be between 30,000 to 45,000 killed or wounded per month. According to ISW, North Korea will deploy a new military contingent to Russia by mid-March 2025. A high-ranking US defense official stated that additional North Korean forces will arrive in Russia 'within the next two months' (approximately mid-March 2025), but did not specify the number of troops or whether North Korea is conducting a rotation of forces or increasing the size of its overall group in Russia. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff reported on December 23 that North Korea may be preparing to deploy an unspecified number of additional forces to Ukraine and military equipment to Russia or as part of a rotation or additional deployment of troops. 'The entire North Korean contingent in Russia may be killed or wounded in combat by mid-April 2025 at the current rate of losses, and a new deployment of North Korean forces - whether to reinforce the current group or to rotate existing forces - is likely intended to support the pace of Russian operations, despite the significant losses of 30,000 to 45,000 people (combined killed and wounded) per month,' ISW analysts believe. It is known that North Korean troops have been training on the east of Russia for at least a month before deployment to the Kursk region for further training in the rear area in November 2024 and joining combat operations by early December 2024. This schedule approximately aligns with the possibility that a new contingent of North Korean forces may undergo training and replace the reduced group in the Kursk region by mid-April 2025, assuming that the next batch of North Korean forces will be trained for the same amount of time as their predecessors and will be deployed in Russia in late January or early February 2025. These new North Korean forces are unlikely to significantly improve Russian operations and will likely face high losses and complications when interacting with Russian forces, assuming that the Russian command continues to use North Korean forces in the same way as before,' ISW said. As a reminder, the US Ministry of Defense stated that they do not see significant effectiveness in the participation of North Korean military in battles against the VCSU in the Kursk region. North Korean forces will suffer significant losses. 'According to the ISW, the new deployment of North Korean forces is likely intended to support the pace of Russian operations, despite the significant losses of 30,000 to 45,000 people (combined killed and wounded) per month,' said a high-ranking US defense official.

North Korean military do not stop moving on the battlefield even under fire. North Korea actively helps Russia in its war against Ukraine, which is becoming a new factor that is alarming the global community. KNR is providing Russia with ammunition and equipment, which indicates a serious weakness of Putin and exhaustion of his resources. Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said, 'If we bring active North Korean troops to Europe for the first time in history, just a few hundred kilometers from the NATO and EU border, this changes the essence of this conflict and this aggression.' Although the number of North Korean troops is small, the fact of their participation in the fighting on the side of Russia should attract the attention of the US and Europe. Support from North Korea is part of a bilateral agreement between North Korea and Russia and may become a precedent for further escalation of the conflict. It is worth noting that North Korean troops, which were sent to help Russia in the war against Ukraine, suffer very high losses and will end by mid-April 2025 if the situation does not change.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 03:07 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ato/viyska-kndr-ne-vryatuyut-ministr-rozpoviv-pro-golovnu-slabkist-putina-2749968.html)\n\n**Pentagon Warns North Korea: Nuclear Strike Will Lead to 'End of the Regime'**\nThe Pentagon has stated that any attempt by North Korea to use nuclear weapons against the US and its allies would result in 'the end of the regime' and a decisive response.

In Japan, he will confirm the plan to closely cooperate on issues such as China's aggressive actions in the East and South China Seas, North Korea's nuclear and missile development, and the abduction issue. 'The United States will continue to work closely with our allies and partners to address these challenges and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific region,' said a State Department spokesperson.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 02:13 AM\nSource:[\u7523\u7d4c\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://www.sankei.com/article/20250104-BFNZQQNFDZKLVCDU7FXYX2UYKE/)\n\n**North Korea's Strategic Move: Waiting for Trump's Inauguration**\nNorth Korea did not take advantage of the chaos to invade South Korea, and instead chose to wait until after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. According to Song Lu Zheng, a Chinese scholar, North Korea's decision to announce a 'most hardline response to the US strategy' in 2025 is a tactic to raise the stakes in negotiations with Trump. Song Lu Zheng said, 'North Korea has long been living in the middle of great powers and is a master of big power games. Rather than being a pawn, North Korea wants to be the player, taking the initiative.' By announcing its hardline strategy before negotiations with Trump, North Korea is trying to increase its bargaining power. The current international environment is favorable to North Korea, with Russia's support and South Korea's internal turmoil, as well as Trump's proposal to reduce US military presence in the region.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 01, 2025 05:31 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/6809/8462370)\n\n**Kim Jong Un Sends New Year's Wishes to Vladimir Putin, Praises Evolving Relations**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has already sent his New Year's wishes to his 'dearest friend and comrade' Vladimir Putin, praising the evolution of relations between the two countries, according to state media in North Korea.

In his letter, Kim Jong Un also expressed the hope that 2025 would be the year 'where the Russian army and people will defeat neo-Nazism and achieve a great victory.' The US and South Korea have accused North Korea of sending over 10,000 soldiers to help Russia fight in Ukraine.

The report stated that the US is the most 'backward' country that considers anti-communism as a fixed policy. North Korea also criticized the growing relations between South Korea, the US, and Japan, saying that they have 'expanded into a nuclear military bloc for aggression.' The country also accused South Korea of 'turning into a pro-US anti-communist site.' In a speech to top officials, Kim Jong-un outlined the 'strategy to counter the US in the most severe way,' according to the report, without providing details. The report also mentioned that the meeting discussed the response to the widespread floods that hit the country earlier this year, as well as a commitment to strengthen relations with 'friendly countries.' North Korea often uses such party meetings and Kim's speeches to announce major policies. The report comes after Seoul's military claimed that over 1,000 North Korean soldiers were killed or injured since they entered the conflict in Ukraine as part of a military deal between Pyongyang and Moscow. North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A historic defense pact between Kim and Putin, signed in June when the Russian president visited Pyongyang, has come into effect this month. Putin described the document as a 'breakthrough agreement.' Official media in North Korea said on Friday that Putin sent a New Year's message to Kim, saying: 'Our bilateral relations have improved since our talks in June in Pyongyang.' Allies of Ukraine have described North Korea's increasing involvement in the war as a 'dangerous escalation' of the conflict.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 29, 2024 03:31 PM\nSource:[thenationpress.net](https://thenationpress.net/news-253575.html)\n\n**North Korea's 2024: A Year of Strategic Choices and Suppression**\nNorth Korea has been making headlines in 2024, particularly with its relations with Russia. In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Pyongyang and signed a comprehensive strategic partnership agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This agreement, which came into effect on December 4, promises immediate military support in case of external aggression. However, North Korea began deploying troops to Ukraine in October, before the agreement took effect. This move has been seen as a strategic choice by North Korea in response to the changing international landscape. The current international system is characterized by a complex crisis, with the US-China strategic competition and the Russia-Ukraine war. North Korea has been using this situation to its advantage, seeking a way to survive. The recent discovery of a handwritten letter from a North Korean soldier in Ukraine has shed light on the soldiers' thoughts and feelings. The letter, which was found by Ukrainian special forces, expresses the soldier's longing for home and his hope for a speedy end to the war. North Korea's decision to deploy troops to Ukraine has been met with criticism, with some analysts viewing it as a move to maintain its regime. The North Korean government has also been accused of suppressing dissent and promoting a cult of personality around Kim Jong-un. The country's 'two-state declaration' has been seen as a move to justify its nuclear program and to eliminate the norms of the 'North-South Joint Declaration' and the 'Korean Peninsula Denuclearization Declaration'. The South Korean government has analyzed that North Korea has abolished all its organizations for engaging with South Korea. The North Korean government has also been accused of suppressing dissent and promoting a cult of personality around Kim Jong-un. \nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 02:34 PM\nSource:[Radio Free Asia](https://www.rfa.org/korean/weekly_program/news_analysis/top-north-korea-news-2024-12272024093406.html)\n\n",

Since direct military invasions are highly consequential and have international implications, the base rate for North Korea initiating a traditional invasion is extremely low. Even during heightened periods of tension, including military exercises or provocations, these have not escalated into a full-scale invasion. Hence, estimating a base rate of less than 5% for such an occurrence within a given short timeframe seems reasonable.",
