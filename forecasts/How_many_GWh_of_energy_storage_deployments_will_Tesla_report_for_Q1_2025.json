Historically, Tesla's energy storage capacity has seen significant annual and quarterly growth, with a focus on expanding its energy products business. The recent quarters have seen reporting figures like approximately 4 GWh to 6.5 GWh. Given this, we'll use a distribution centered around these historical reporting figures with an anticipation of continued growth due to ongoing investments in their Gigafactories and increased demand for renewable energy solutions. The base rate for 0-8.0 GWh is higher since this range encapsulated previous performances frequently, while highest ranges are less probable given past trends.",
