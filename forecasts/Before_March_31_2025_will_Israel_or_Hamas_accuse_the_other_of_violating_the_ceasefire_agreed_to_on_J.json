A young man was killed and two others were injured in the west of the Nuseirat refugee camp, in the center of Gaza, a health source reported. Another teenager was shot and killed in the central region of Rafah, in the southernmost part of the enclave. The Israeli army also opened fire on a group of displaced people waiting for authorization to return to the north of Gaza, injuring five, including a child. Witnesses reported that hundreds of civilians spent the night in the cold, waiting for permits from the occupying forces to return to the north, as agreed upon in mid-January. Israeli authorities postponed the opening of the roads, scheduled for Sunday, by 24 hours, on the condition that settler Arbel Yehud would be released. The Hamas movement responded that Yehud will be handed over in the next prisoner exchange. The first phase of the step-by-step agreement, scheduled to last six weeks, went into effect on January 19, suspending the Israeli extermination war against the coastal enclave's civilian population. Since then, seven Israeli prisoners of war, including four soldiers, have been released in exchange for 290 Palestinian political prisoners. The Qatari-Egyptian-US mediated agreement ended the 470-day Israeli campaign in Gaza, which left at least 48,000 Palestinians dead, 111,000 injured, and around two million displaced. In January 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague accepted a South African complaint of genocide and war crimes against Tel Aviv, registered in December. In November, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 01:23 PM\nSource:[monitordooriente.com](https://www.monitordooriente.com/20250128-israel-viola-cessar-fogo-em-gaza-deixa-dois-mortos-e-sete-feridos/)\n\n**Israel Admits to Violating Ceasefire Agreement with Hamas**\nThe Israeli military has acknowledged that it violated a ceasefire agreement with Hamas by firing on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, citing 'threats' from Palestinian individuals.

The statement claims that 'suspects' from various locations in the Gaza Strip were moving towards Israeli forces, posing a threat, and that multiple incidents occurred, prompting Israeli soldiers to fire on them. It has been reported that Israeli forces launched a ceasefire-violating attack on a vehicle in the Gaza Strip last night, resulting in the death of a girl and injuries to three civilians.

However, many experts believe that Israel may resume attacks in March. This would be challenging for Israel as millions of Palestinians are returning to northern Gaza, making it difficult for Benjamin Netanyahu. The future of Israel-Hamas relations is uncertain. If Israel resumes war, it would create a massive humanitarian crisis and isolate Israel internationally. Last year, Israel's attack was justified due to Hamas' attack on October 7, but this time, the global community may react differently. Israel would need to deploy a large number of soldiers if it resumes war, which could be a challenge. The military's reserve forces are also a concern. Politically, Netanyahu would face challenges at home and internationally. The Israeli public is already exhausted from a long war. Experts believe that Israel may not have the option for a full-scale war and may instead continue with small operations to pressure Hamas. However, this would not lead to significant changes in Gaza.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 06:58 AM\nSource:[Navbharat Times](https://navbharattimes.indiatimes.com/world/uae/israel-hamas-ceasefire-can-idf-return-to-war-with-gaza-north-repopulated-analysis/articleshow/117620824.cms)\n\n**Israel admitted to violating the ceasefire in Gaza.**\nIsrael has admitted to violating the ceasefire agreement with Hamas by firing at Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, claiming they posed a 'threat' to its forces.

The return was made possible by an agreement between Israel and Hamas, which allowed Palestinians to begin returning from the south of the Gaza Strip to the northern neighborhoods of the enclave in exchange for the release of three Israeli hostages before Friday. Hamas had released a second group of hostages last week as part of the agreement with Israel, which was initiated a week ago. In exchange for the release, 200 Palestinian prisoners, including those convicted of terrorism, were released. Fadi Al Sinwar, a resident of Gaza, said, 'We've been missing our home. We've been living in tents for 470 days.' Nadia Qassem, from the Al Shati refugee camp, said, 'We've been waiting for this day for so long,' although many will only find rubble where their homes once stood. 'I want to go home... Even if my house is destroyed. I miss my land and my place,' she said. The return was delayed by 48 hours after Israel accused Hamas of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement by releasing the hostage Arbel Yehud, which delayed the opening of the Netzarim crossing that divides the territory. Hamas and Israel agreed to release more hostages, including Yehud, on Thursday and Saturday, according to the Office of the Israeli Prime Minister. The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States, was reached on January 15 and went into effect on January 19.

Israel also stated that Hamas failed to release a civilian hostage, Arbel Yegud, along with four female soldiers on Saturday, January 25. As a result, Israel will not allow the planned return of displaced Palestinians to the northern Gaza Strip until Yegud is released. This decision also means that the Israeli military, the IDF, will not withdraw its troops from the Netzarim Corridor, as planned for Sunday. The corridor divides the Gaza Strip in half from east to west and separates its south from its north.

According to the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, Hamas has 'twice breached the agreement: Arbel Yehud has not been released, and the list of captives' current status for the first stage has not been provided.' As a result, Israel has decided to prevent the movement of Gaza residents to the north of the sector.

'We are determined to secure the return of all hostages - both living and dead,' the statement emphasized. Meanwhile, until the issue of Arbel Yehud's release is resolved, Israel will not allow peaceful residents to return to the north of the Gaza Strip, the Prime Minister's Office announced. Hamas had previously released a second group of hostages as part of the agreement, which began a week ago. In exchange, Israel released four Israeli soldiers from prison and freed 200 Palestinian prisoners, including those sentenced to life in prison for terrorism. According to Al Jazeera, Hamas has informed mediators that Arbel Yehud is alive and will be handed over to Israel on February 1. A Hamas representative claimed that Yehud is a military personnel and was training for the Israeli army. Bassam Na'im, a high-ranking Hamas representative, stated that Palestinians will never agree to US President Donald Trump's proposal to temporarily relocate the majority of Gaza's population to other areas, including Egypt and Jordan. 'Even if the intentions seem benevolent under the guise of reconstruction,' Na'im said, 'the Palestinian people will never agree to such a proposal.' He also stated that Palestinians can rebuild Gaza 'even better than before' if Israel lifts its blockade.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 01:59 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/uk/izrail-zvinuvativ-hamas-u-porusenni-ugodi-pro-pripinenna-vognu/a-71415211)\n\n**Israel Accuses Hamas of Violating Ceasefire Agreement**\nIsrael has accused Hamas of violating the terms of the ceasefire agreement by not releasing Israeli hostage Arbel Yehud and not providing a list of living and deceased captives.

'In connection with this, it was decided not to allow the movement of Gaza residents to the north of the sector,' said Dmitry Gendelman, an advisor to the Israeli prime minister's office.

The fourth, Arbel Yehud, remains in captivity, but the Palestinian movement has presented evidence that she is alive and has promised to release her during the next stage. In exchange, 200 Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli prisons, including those sentenced to life for terrorism. In addition, Palestinians were supposed to receive the opportunity to return to the north from the south of the Gaza Strip, where they were forced to resettle due to military actions.

Meanwhile, the Hamas Health Ministry reported that at least 88 Palestinians were killed in Gaza over the past 24 hours following Israeli attacks. The total number of deaths in the conflict that began on October 7, 2023 has risen to 45,805, with 109,064 injured. The Israeli army reported that it had struck 100 Hamas targets along the Gaza Strip, explaining that 'the terrorist organization launched numerous missiles from the Palestinian enclave towards Israel'. Before the attacks, the Israeli Defense Forces took numerous measures 'to mitigate the risk of harm to civilians, including the use of precision ammunition, aerial surveillance, and additional intelligence activities'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 05, 2025 03:22 PM\nSource:[ansabrasil.com.br](https://ansabrasil.com.br/brasil/noticias/ultimo_momento/2025/01/05/israel-acusa-hezbollah-de-violar-acordo-de-cessar-fogo_6bb75419-2cbd-4742-a2c9-94059c71f29c.html)\n\n",
