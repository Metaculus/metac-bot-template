The Statistics Department forecasts a full-year growth of 5.1% in 2024, a recovery from the 3.6% growth seen in 2023. Bloomberg estimates a y-o-y growth of 4.8%, while UOB Global Economics & Markets Research estimates 5%. Inflation data is also expected from China and India, with ING predicting a modest y-o-y uptick to around 0.4% in China.

This is a significant increase of almost twice the amount over the past four years, despite the COVID-19 restrictions and sanctions. The real GDP growth rate has also been revised upwards to 4.1% in 2024, exceeding expectations. The Ministry of Economic Development notes that this result was achieved despite the challenges, and that the previous record was set over a period of ten years. The high real GDP growth rate has been maintained for the second year, with the third revision of Rosstat's data for 2023 increasing it to 4.1% from 3.6%. The decline in 2022 has also been revised to -1.4% from -1.2%. The changes in the data are largely due to the revision of the GDP deflator, which continues to grow at a faster rate than production. The deflator for 2022 was revised to 18.2% from 15.7%, and for 2023 to 8% from 7%. The current estimate for 2024 is 8.9%. The Ministry of Economic Development had planned for a 3.8% increase in prices in the industry, but the actual figure was 15.5% in extraction and 10% in processing. The structure of GDP in 2024 was similar to that of 2023, with the share of expenditures on final consumption increasing to 68.8% from 68.4%, driven by the population. The share of gross accumulation remained unchanged, while the share of net exports decreased to 3.8% from 4.2%. According to analysts at the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMAS), the economy 'has found itself in the zone of inflationary growth, with the inflation rate exceeding economic growth.' The nominal GDP in dollars in 2024 was approximately $2.16 trillion, or $14,800 per capita, according to estimates by analysts at the Telegram channel MMI. This is close to the level of 2013, before the sanctions, when the GDP per capita was $15,900. In 2025, the GDP per capita in Russia may reach $15,100, but to achieve this, the government and the Central Bank need to simultaneously reduce inflation and maintain growth with limited stimulation. This task appears complex, as the regulators are struggling with the consequences of previous government spending in the second half of 2024 and the beginning of 2025. However, the data from Rosstat on the state of the economy in December 2024 and some leading indicators show a new surge due to a surge in budget expenditures. However, analysts at Raiffeisenbank do not consider it sustainable, as 'such surges have often been temporary in history,' and in general, they expect a slowdown in growth this year 'taking into account budget consolidation and tight monetary policy.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 06:41 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7495952)\n\n**US Labor Market Shows Resilience Despite Initial Disappointment**\nDespite initial disappointment with the January job numbers, the US labor market showed surprising resilience. New hires fell short of expectations, increasing by only 143,000 to 256,000 outside of agriculture. However, revisions to the previous two months' numbers were significant, with 100,000 added jobs each. The total number of jobs for 2024 was revised downward by around 600,000. The usual large January revisions also affected other statistics, with the number of employed individuals increasing by 2.1 million, including 2 million employed and 100,000 unemployed. This led to a decline in the unemployment rate from 4.1% to 4.0% and an increase in the employment rate from 62.6% to 62.5%. Wages also showed robust growth, increasing by 0.5% from 0.3% in the previous month to 4.1% in the year-over-year comparison. According to Christian Scherrmann, US economist, 'the underlying numbers are stronger than the disappointing new hires suggest, and the labor market seems to have gained momentum by the end of 2024 and into early 2025.' Strong upward revisions to population estimates are likely due to immigration in 2024, which could provide a hawkish input for the US central bank. Recent trends indicate a likely decrease in foreign labor supply, which could lead to further wage increases.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[4investors.de](https://www.4investors.de/nachrichten/boerse.php?sektion=stock&ID=181786)\n\n**Markets on High Alert for Weekend Tariff Developments**\nThe markets will be closely watching the weekend for a potential agreement to delay the start of US tariffs on China. Next week, there will be relatively few important macroeconomic data releases, and market operators will focus on the weekend's developments. On Sunday, China will release inflation and producer price data, which is unlikely to significantly change the current outlook. The Sentix investor confidence index for the eurozone and French unemployment data for the fourth quarter of 2024 will be released on Monday, followed by the German government's 5-year bond auction and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony on economic prospects and recent monetary policy interventions.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, NASDAQ 100 rose 0.1%, and DJ dropped 0.5%. The decline was triggered by the release of the BLS labor market data and new statements from Donald Trump. The Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 143,000 in January, beating the forecast of 169,000. The unemployment rate decreased to 4% from 4.1% (forecast: 4.1%). The average hourly earnings grew by 4.1% year-over-year (forecast: 3.8%). The ISM in the manufacturing sector rose to 50.9 points, while the services sector index fell to 52.8 points. According to the GDPNow service, the US GDP may have grown by 2.9% in the first quarter, down from the previous estimate of 3.9%. Mexico and Canada reached an agreement with Trump to delay new tariffs, while China announced new tariffs on some US goods, an antitrust investigation into Google, and restrictions on the export of minerals. Trump announced that he will impose retaliatory tariffs on countries that impose tariffs on US goods next week, without specifying which countries will be affected. The earnings season continues, with 62% of S&P 500 companies having reported their Q4 results. Alphabet, Amazon, Uber Technologies, and AMD fell by 7.3%, 4.1%, 7.6%, and 6.3%, respectively, in the past two trading sessions. Key events to watch include consumer and producer inflation, retail sales, and industrial production. The CPI will be the key indicator of the week. The publication of heavyweight earnings reports is almost complete, with McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and Cisco set to report next week. Trump's statements and potential reactions to them will also be closely watched. The S&P 500 has lost 1% since February 7, 2024, and is currently trading at 6026 points. A scenario of a decline to 5880 points is possible, with resistance levels at 6145 and 6260 points, representing 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci projections from the August 2024 wave.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[bcs-express.ru](https://bcs-express.ru/novosti-i-analitika/amerika-na-mosbirzhe-proval-naia-piatnitsa)\n\n**January Jobs Report: 2024 Employment Revised Down by 600,000**\nThe January jobs report for 2024 has been revised down by 600,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This is not the first time the BLS has made significant revisions to the job numbers, as they previously revised the job number down by over 800,000 between April 2023 and March 2024. Critics argue that the BLS often buries these revisions in the report, making it difficult for people to notice. Some have pointed out that the January jobs report only goes up to January 12, when President Joe Biden was still in office, and that the report is not a reflection of the current job market. As E.J. Antoni, Ph.D. noted, the business employment dynamics data from BLS and early benchmark from PHL Fed point to even worse downward revisions in the next annual benchmark.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 06:00 PM\nSource:[legalinsurrection.com](https://legalinsurrection.com/2025/02/january-jobs-report-2024-employment-revised-down-by-600000/)\n\n**Chilean Government Lowers Economic Growth Forecast to 2.5% for 2025**\nThe Chilean government has revised its economic growth forecast for this year to 2.5%, while increasing its inflation prediction, according to the Public Finance Report for the fourth quarter of 2024. The report states that the country's economic performance would be better than the 2.4% expansion it achieved last year. 'The current scenario considers a 2.5% GDP growth for 2025, highlighting a significant recovery of investment. This is due to a 3.9% annual increase in gross fixed capital formation, which strongly rebounded after the decline in 2024,' said the Budget Office. The average annual inflation rate would reach 4.7% this year, above the previously projected 4.2%. 'This correction is largely influenced by higher inflation concentrated in the first months of the year, normalizing towards the rest of 2025.' The government also estimated a lower average price for copper, the country's main export, at $4.26 per dollar, below its previous estimate of $4.30. Domestic demand is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2025, below the previous estimate of 3.4%. Between 2026-2029, the mining GDP is expected to be lower than previously estimated, with a growth rate of 2.7% and 2.5% in 2026 and 2027, respectively, before converging to a growth rate of 2.0% in 2028 and 2029. 'The medium-term scenario contemplates that local activity will transition to its trend growth rates towards the end of the projection period,' it noted.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[larepublica.co](https://www.larepublica.co/globoeconomia/gobierno-chileno-recorta-proyeccion-de-crecimiento-economico-a-2-5-para-este-ano-4057766)\n\n**Government Makes Projections for 2025 with Average Dollar at $4,360 and Brent at $74.3**\nThe Ministry of Finance, led by Minister Diego Guevara, presented the 2025 Financial Plan, with macroeconomic projections for the current year. The plan takes into account the negative impact of 2024 on state finances, mainly due to the decline in tax revenue. The government has recalculated the GDP growth rate, lowering it from 3% to 2.6% by the end of this year. The inflation rate for 2025 is projected to be 3.6%. The average exchange rate is expected to be $4,360, while the Brent oil barrel is expected to trade at an average of $74.3. Minister Guevara stated, 'We have updated the GDP growth rate to 1.8% for the previous year. It is essential to mention that we have made an adjustment to the growth perspective in the 2024 fiscal framework, which was at 3% and we adjusted it to 2.6% for this year's growth.' The minister highlighted that it is positive that the country maintains its growth path, considering that the GDP growth rate in 2023 was 0.6%. The recovery of the economy is expected to be driven by a stronger dynamism in activities such as agriculture, livestock, and entertainment, as well as the recovery of sectors such as construction and civil works. The minister emphasized that there is optimism about the dynamism in household consumption, fixed investment, and exports, which would allow consolidating the growth data for the end of the previous year. For 2025, the favorable behavior of internal demand, combined with increased consumption and potential investment, would drive the increase in GDP by the end of the year. Additionally, the government is correcting the current account deficit progressively. Minister Guevara stated, 'It is essential to take into account that, despite the fact that the interest rate decline speed will be lower this year, we must consider the lags of monetary policy, which will be seen this year, and will be transmitted in better rates, which will improve financing and consumption conditions.' The government faced challenges in 2024, mainly due to the decline in tax revenue. Despite this, the minister emphasized that the Fiscal Rule was met. The government collected $18.5 billion less in 2024 than in 2023, and $13.9 billion less than estimated in the medium-term fiscal framework for 2024, resulting in a cut of $28.4 billion in the General Budget. The deficit fiscal was 6.8% of GDP, compared to 3.2% in 2023. The government has made an effort to control the fiscal deficit, which is expected to be financed with $104.7 billion in disbursements, including $35.6 billion in foreign debt and $68.8 billion in local debt. The local debt will be composed of $45 billion in ordinary TES, $1.5 billion in green TES, and $22.3 billion in operations and payment of pension bonds. The financing for 2025 will come from 66% of operations in local currency and 34% of instruments in foreign currency. The minister emphasized that the government is monitoring the evolution of revenues to ensure that the target aligns with its fiscal strategy, with the effective availability of resources to protect public finances. The government's strategy, which demonstrated its effectiveness in the second half of 2024, will help to face the rigidity of the Colombian public budget structure, which limits discretionary spending adjustments, hinders the implementation of the government's agenda, and affects mainly the resources allocated to public investment, which are essential to drive long-term growth. The government's revenues, excluding tax revenues, reached $279.228 million by the end of 2024, while tax revenues reached $243.578 million. With the update of the 2025 Financial Plan, the figure closed at $327.948 million, $48.719 million more. The General Budget for 2025 was $343.161 million, and with the update of the Financial Plan, it was $327.948 million, $15.214 million less. The total expenditure for 2024 by the government closed at $394.651 million, a figure lower than the updated one with the 2025 Financial Plan, which reached $418.749 million, $24.098 million more. The PGN's total consolidated expenditure reached $427.389 million. The financial surpluses at the end of 2024 were $25.035 million, and by the PGN, the figure was $19.526 million. With the new Financial Plan, the figure was $21.598 million, $3.437 million less. The primary balance of the fulfillment of the Fiscal Rule for 2024 was -$40.978 million, and with the update of the 2025 Financial Plan, the figure decreased to $1.215 million, ensuring sustainability. The economic ministry made a re-evaluation of the economic projections in accordance with what is being seen in the last days. Yesterday, the Dane reported that the IPC data for January reflected a slight increase compared to December, at 5.22%. Although in the course of the year, it has been evident that its trend continues to decline. One of the main reasons for the increase of 0.94% compared to the end of 2024 was the increase in the minimum wage, although the government considers that inflation will continue to decline for the remainder of the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[larepublica.co](https://www.larepublica.co/economia/gobierno-hace-cuentas-para-2025-con-el-dolar-promedio-en-4-360-y-brent-a-us-74-3-4057459)\n\n**US Job Growth Slowed in January After 2024 Downward Revision**\nUS job growth slowed in January, with nonfarm payrolls increasing by 143,000, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Annual revisions showed job growth averaged 166,000 a month last year, a slowdown from the initially reported 186,000 pace. The labor market remains healthy, but the Federal Reserve has signaled it's not in a hurry to lower borrowing costs further. The BLS said severe winter weather had 'no discernible effect' on employment, but nearly 600,000 people didn't work in January due to bad weather. Hourly wages climbed 0.5% from December and 4.1% from a year ago. The jobs report included an annual update to the employer survey, which showed job growth was 589,000 lower in the 12 months through March 2024 than initially reported. Bloomberg Economics said, 'It\u2019s notable that January\u2019s payroll print is so tepid \u2014 and despite the revisions to past data, we think both the establishment and household survey are now overstating the level of employment.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[advisorperspectives.com](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2025/02/07/us-job-slowed-january-after-2024-downward-revision)\n\n**U.S 3Q GDP Gets Healthy Upward Revision**\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released a revised report on Dec. 19, showing that the nation's real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter of 2024. This is up from the previous estimate of 2.8% and matches the forecasted 3.1% growth. The acceleration in real GDP was primarily driven by increases in consumer spending, exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and federal government spending. However, when compared to the second quarter, the acceleration was offset by a downturn in private inventory investment and a larger decrease in residential fixed investment. The 4Q and full-year 2024 GDP first estimate will be released on Jan. 30.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 03:40 PM\nSource:[mdm.com](https://www.mdm.com/news/research/economic-trends/u-s-3q-gdp-gets-healthy-upward-revision/)\n\n**US GDP Data Unexpectedly Revised Upwards, Hawkish Expectations of Federal Reserve Continue to Rise**\nThe US GDP data for the third quarter has been unexpectedly revised upwards, with a growth rate of 3.1% exceeding the previous value of 2.8%. This has further strengthened the hawkish expectations of the Federal Reserve. The core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index for the third quarter was revised upwards to 2.2%, higher than the expected 2.1%. The Atlanta Fed's real-time GDP estimate suggests that the US economy is expected to maintain its growth momentum in the last three months of 2024, with a growth rate of 3.2%. This has reduced the urgency for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, and the market may see a more hawkish Federal Reserve in the future. The labor market remains resilient, with the number of initial claims for unemployment benefits decreasing by 22,000 to 2.2 million, and the number of continued claims decreasing by 5,000 to 1.87 million. The Federal Reserve Chairman Powell has also stated that the labor market is cooling down, but the cooling speed is not fast and has not caused any real concerns. The latest data has also supported the Federal Reserve's prediction made earlier this week, which includes an upward revision of GDP growth expectations for this year and next, a downward revision of unemployment rate expectations for this year and next, and an upward revision of inflation expectations for 2024-2026. The hawkish policy stance of the Federal Reserve has been further supported by the recent economic data. PIMCO's director and economist Tiffany Wilding stated that the January meeting may be the time when the Federal Reserve starts to hold back, although the Federal Reserve's policy stance has become less restrictive, it is still in a restrictive level, and the official is still inclined to cut interest rates. However, the threshold for resuming tightening is higher, and the Federal Reserve needs to see further progress in anti-inflation or an increase in unemployment rate before restoring the easing cycle. The hawkish tendency of the Federal Reserve has been fully reflected in the bond market, with the yield curve of US Treasury bonds reaching its steepest level in about 30 months. Specifically, short-term bond yields have fallen, while long-term bond yields have risen sharply. The 2-year, 5-year, 10-year, and 30-year US Treasury bond yields have fallen by 4 basis points, risen by 1.6 basis points, risen by 4.6 basis points, and risen by 6.2 basis points, respectively. It is worth noting that the 10-year US Treasury bond yield, known as the 'global asset pricing anchor', has risen from a low of 3.6% in mid-September to nearly 1%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 07:53 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202412203274463829.html)\n\n**US third quarter GDP revised up on consumer, export boost**\nThe US economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the third quarter, up from earlier estimates of 2.8 percent, due to 'upward revisions to exports and consumer spending', according to the Commerce Department. The increase was partially offset by a downward revision to private inventory investment. Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at Oxford Economics, said, 'The composition of revisions does strengthen our conviction that the economy is on solid footing and that 2025 will be another good year.' However, he warned that variations in household incomes may impact growth, with high-income households benefiting from a tight labor market and lower-income households remaining under financial pressure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 01:21 AM\nSource:[inquirer.net](https://business.inquirer.net/497675/us-third-quarter-gdp-revised-up-on-consumer-export-boost)\n\n**Q3 GDP Third Estimate: Real GDP At 3.1%, Above Forecast**\nThe U.S. economy grew above expectations in the third quarter of 2024, with real gross domestic product increasing at an annual rate of 3.1%.

The update mainly reflected upward revisions in exports and consumer spending, which were partially offset by a downward revision in private inventory investment. Imports, which subtract from GDP, were also revised upward. The latest data marked a slight acceleration compared to the second quarter, when real GDP increased by 3%. The IMF projects US economic growth of 2.8% in 2024, while the Federal Reserve (Fed) expects 2.5% growth. Regardless of which is correct, it will be lower than the projected growth for Russia's economy, even with the sanctions imposed by the US. Russia's GDP is expected to grow around 3.9% to 4% in 2024, said President Vladimir Putin during his annual press conference on this Thursday. He stated that, overall, the economic situation remains stable, despite external challenges. 'Last year, our economic growth was 3.6%, this year it will be 3.9%, perhaps even 4%', he said. Putin also noted that many economic indicators remain satisfactory, for example, the unemployment rate is currently at a record low of 2.3%. The inflation rate is currently at 9.3%, which continues to be 'an alarming signal', warned Putin. The growth of Brazil's economy is expected to fall between the two: on this Thursday, the Brazilian Central Bank (BC) raised its projection for the Gross Domestic Product to 3.2% to 3.5%. The projection is contained in the Inflation Report, a quarterly publication of the BC.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 10:04 PM\nSource:[monitormercantil.com.br](https://monitormercantil.com.br/pib-dos-eua-acelera-mas-perde-para-alta-na-russia/)\n\n**US GDP Growth Revised Upward to 3.1% in Third Quarter**\nThe US GDP growth in the third quarter was revised upward to 3.1% annualized, according to the latest estimate from the Department of Commerce.

This growth exceeds the second estimate of 2.8% and marks an improvement over the 3% growth in the previous quarter. A key factor in this growth was the acceleration of consumer spending, which increased by 3.7% compared to 2.8% in the previous quarter. Despite overall growth, business profits slowed down, showing a 0.4% decline compared to the robust 3.5% growth in the previous quarter. This decline in profits may reflect pressures on margins due to various economic and market factors. The PCE price index, a key measure of inflation, fell to 1.5%, while the core index rose to 2.2%. These data suggest a low-inflation environment that could influence future monetary policy decisions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 02:58 PM\nSource:[finanzaonline.com](https://www.finanzaonline.com/notizie/usa-pil-in-crescita-oltre-le-aspettative-nel-terzo-trimestre-2024)\n\n**US Economic Growth Revised Upward in 3rd Quarter**\nThe US economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, driven by robust consumer spending. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at an annualized revised rate of 3.1%, according to the Commerce Department's third estimate of the third quarter GDP, released on Thursday. Economists consulted by Reuters had predicted that the GDP would not be revised. The revision reflected improvements in consumer spending and export growth, which offset downward revisions in private inventory investment and upward revisions in imports.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 02:31 PM\nSource:[UOL](https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/reuters/2024/12/19/crescimento-economico-dos-eua-no-3-trimestre-e-revisado-para-cima.htm)\n\n**Final 3Q GDP Estimate Revises Growth Up to 3.1%**\nThe U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 3.1% in the third quarter, exceeding initial estimates of 2.8%. The Commerce Department attributed the upward revision to increased exports and stronger consumer spending, offset by a decrease in investment in private inventories. Economists had expected a smaller revision to 2.9% growth. The Atlanta Fed's real-time GDP estimator suggests the economy may sustain momentum in the fourth quarter, with a projected growth rate of 3.2%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 02:27 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202412195600/final-3q-gdp-estimate-revises-growth-up-to-31)\n\n**US GDP Growth Revised Upwards to 3.1% in Third Quarter**\nThe US economy has seen a revision in the third quarter GDP growth rate from 2.8% to 3.1%. This increase is mainly due to 'revisions upwards of exports and consumer spending that were partially offset by a downward revision of private investment in inventories'. Imports, which are a subtraction in the GDP calculation, were also revised upwards. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the GDP growth reflected 'increases in consumer spending, exports, non-residential fixed investment, and federal government spending'. The US economy has accelerated since the second quarter, where the GDP grew 3%. This improvement is due to 'accelerations in exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending', which were partially offset by a deceleration of private investment in inventories and a greater decrease in residential fixed investment. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index remained at 1.5%, while the core inflation indicator was revised upwards to 2.2%. Personal income in current dollars increased by $191.7 billion in the quarter, a revision upwards of $15.8 billion from the previous estimate. Disposable personal income increased by $141.5 billion, or 2.7%, after being revised upwards by $18.6 billion. Oxford Economics analysts believe that the upward revision of GDP was 'a bit larger' than their forecast, which was in turn higher than the consensus forecast. However, they believe that 'the implications for short-term forecasting are small'. 'The composition of the revisions reinforces our conviction that the economy has a solid foundation and that 2025 will be another good year', they add. Initial jobless claims for the week ending December 14 fell to 220,000, a decrease of 22,000 from the previous week's level, according to the US Department of Labor. This figure was below the 230,000 consensus forecast. The unemployment rate remained at 1.2%, and the number of unemployed workers decreased to 1,874,000, a decrease of 5,000 from the previous period.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 02:20 PM\nSource:[ecobolsa.com](https://www.ecobolsa.com/noticias/eeuu-revisa-alza-crecimiento-pib-tercer-trimestre-31-28.html)\n\n**US GDP Revised To 3.1%, Jobless Claims Dip More Than Expected, Treasury Yields Hit 7-Month High - Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (ARCA:UUP), SPDR S&P 500 (ARCA:SPY)**\nThe US GDP was revised to 3.1% in Q3, exceeding the prior estimate of 2.8%. This marks the fastest pace of economic expansion since Q4 2023, driven by robust household spending and a larger increase in exports. Consumer spending rose 3.7% in Q3, its strongest pace since Q1 2023, fueled by household resilience despite higher borrowing costs. Labor market data revealed a decline in unemployment claims, with initial jobless claims falling to 220,000 and continuing claims dropping to 1.874 million. Treasury yields continued their climb, with yields on the 10-year benchmark surpassing 4.53%, hitting the highest levels since early May 2024. 'The upward revision was driven primarily by robust household spending and a larger increase in exports,' according to the official final reading. 'Consumer spending remains the growth engine,' said the report, highlighting the continued resilience of households despite high borrowing costs and lingering inflationary pressures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 02:07 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/economics/macro-economic-events/24/12/42585715/us-gdp-upwardly-revised-to-31-in-q3-jobless-claims-drop-more-than-expected-treasury-yields-hit-7-month-highs)\n\n**US GDP Growth Rate Revised Upward to 3.1% in Third Quarter**\nThe US Department of Commerce has announced the final estimate of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for the third quarter of this year. According to the data, the US GDP grew by 3.1% year-over-year in the third quarter. This is higher than the previous estimate of 2.8% growth. The country's economy showed a growth rate of 1.6% in the first quarter and 3% in the second quarter of 2024. The growth in the third quarter was driven by increases in consumer spending, exports, non-residential fixed investments, and federal government spending. The third quarter GDP data was revised upward for exports and consumer spending, downward for private fixed investment, and upward for imports. The personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 1.5% in the third quarter, in line with expectations. This is lower than the 2.5% increase in the second quarter. The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose by 2.2%, exceeding expectations. This is higher than the 2.1% increase expected in the second estimate.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, this revision increases the growth rate from the previously reported 2.8%. The strong US economy, combined with the resilience of inflation, has led the Federal Reserve to revise its monetary policy prospects in its December 18 meeting. Although the Fed decided to lower interest rates for the third consecutive time, it now expects fewer rate cuts in 2025, with Jerome Powell and colleagues planning to lower the cost of money twice a year next year, down from the four previously announced. These data demonstrate that the economy remains in good health, allowing the Fed to take its time to ensure that inflation is brought under control.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 01:42 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Italia](https://it.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/usa-crescita-senza-freni-pil-terzo-trimestre-rivisto-al-rialzo-al-31-2628771)\n\n**US GDP Revised Up to 3.1% in Third Quarter**\nThe US economy has shown solid growth, with the final reading of the country's GDP for the third quarter of 2024 coming in at +3.1%, exceeding the consensus estimate of +2.8%.
