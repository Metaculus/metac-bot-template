Considering the recent rate cuts in 2024 after a period of higher interest rates, it suggests responsiveness to changing economic conditions. Historically, in periods of economic slowdown or financial instability, rate cuts are not uncommon. An initial base rate could be inferred from past instances where the Fed decided to cut rates twice within a few months in 2019 and twice within a few months in late 2024.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets eight times a year to determine the main interest rate in the country, aiming to control the rising inflation levels. In December 2024, the Federal Reserve decided to keep the interest rate at 4.25-4.50% for the third time in 2024, as stated in a press release. The FOMC noted that it will work to slow down the decline in borrowing costs, given the relatively stable unemployment rate and a slight improvement in inflation in recent times. The FOMC also stated in its latest policy statement that the economic activity continues to expand at a strong pace, with a continued decline in the unemployment rate and a high level of inflation.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[cairo24.com](https://www.cairo24.com/2153954)\n\n**Federal Reserve Prepares for First Meeting in 2025 Amid Uncertainty**\nThe Federal Reserve is preparing for its first meeting in 2025, where consumers will be looking for an answer to the question of how long interest rates will remain high. According to a report by BankRate, Americans tasted the sweetness of interest rate cuts they were hoping for last year. With the slowdown in inflation and the emergence of warning signs in the labor market of a sudden slowdown, the officials of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have lowered the interest rate over three consecutive meetings. The current interest rate on federal funds is now within the target range of 4.25% to 4.5%. However, it does not seem that these cuts have alleviated the pressure on consumers, as most consumer borrowing costs are at their highest level in over a decade, according to BankRate data. Meanwhile, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has increased despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts. The FOMC is unlikely to lower interest rates for the fourth consecutive time when it concludes its two-day meeting on January 29, as experts point out that the cut in the Federal Reserve's interest rate-setting meeting in March or even later may not happen if inflation remains stable and the economy remains flexible. Policies such as tariffs, immigration, and taxes pursued by President Donald Trump may complicate the Federal Reserve's plans to lower interest rates if they lead to an increase in inflation. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, has previously indicated that interest rate cuts may be suspended. He acknowledged that inflation has slowed down at a slower pace than expected. Powell said that the officials at the Federal Reserve still believe they are on the right track to lower interest rates more this year, but they want to first gain more confidence that inflation has returned to the right track. He added that a stable labor market also gives them time to be patient. The Federal Reserve has two economic goals: low and stable inflation and maximum employment. Powell said, 'The slower pace of rate cuts this year reflects the higher inflation readings that are expected this year. If the labor market weakens unexpectedly or inflation falls faster than expected, interest rates may be cut faster.' Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2% and has improved all inflation measures since reaching its peak in the summer of 2022, but the next decline to 2% has proven to be the most challenging. The probability of a rate cut in March has fallen to 28% as of January 24. However, it is likely that Federal Reserve officials will avoid closing the door completely to a March rate cut, according to Greg Daco, chief economist at IHS Markit. He adds, 'The rapid improvement in inflation pressure since it peaked at its highest level in 40 years at 9.1% in the summer of 2022 gives many measures hope that inflation will continue to slow down. These measures include slowing wage growth, declining American savings, and a smaller number of jobs per worker - all of which suggest that companies may have less pricing power and consumers may be more sensitive to price increases. Trump's presidency may also be a reason for the Federal Reserve to remain in a 'wait-and-see' position. There is also a risk that inflation may pick up speed again. It is likely that Powell will be asked about Trump's trade, immigration, and tax policies, which may lead to higher prices, according to economists who were polled in the latest BankRate economic indicator survey. In the months following Trump's election, the Federal Reserve Chairman repeatedly stated that it was premature to make the Federal Reserve's monetary policy for Trump a part of interest rate deliberations. However, behind closed doors, the FOMC may be discussing it already. It is likely that Federal Reserve officials will create different economic scenarios than any of Trump's policies and inform the committee of the results, according to Bill English, a professor at Yale School of Management who previously held one of the most influential positions at the Federal Reserve as director of the Monetary Affairs Division of the FOMC. This would mean that Trump's expected policies have played a role in shifting the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut predictions for 2025.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 12:13 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/trump-fed-meeting)\n\n**Federal Reserve Adjusts Interest Rate Expectations in Response to US Election**\nFollowing the US elections, we questioned the Federal Reserve's stance on the new White House occupant.

Several major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Swedish Central Bank, and the Canadian Central Bank, will announce their interest rate decisions this week. The global central bank is heading towards a loose monetary policy, and the interest rate reduction wave is gaining momentum. As the US enters 2025, the question is whether the interest rate reduction wave will continue. The Federal Reserve's move is of great concern to investors around the world. After experiencing three consecutive rate cuts in 2024, totaling 100 basis points, the Federal Reserve has entered a new stage of gradual rate cuts. The market generally expects the Federal Reserve to 'stand pat' at this meeting. The CME Group's Federal Reserve tool shows that the current market expects the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged in January with a probability of nearly 100%. The Federal Reserve has always been responsible for stabilizing prices and achieving full employment. The current US government's policies may trigger inflationary pressures, adding uncertainty to the Federal Reserve's future rate-cutting path. According to the US Labor Department's recent data, the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.9% year-on-year in December 2024 and 0.4% month-on-month. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI rose 0.2% month-on-month and 3.2% year-on-year, slightly lower than the previous month but still higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% long-term target. 'Although the US December inflation data was in line with expectations, the core inflation was slightly lower than expected, but the overall trend is still upward. And the December non-farm data was significantly higher than expected, showing that the US economy still has resilience.' said Wang Xijie, chief investment strategist at Standard Chartered China Wealth Scheme Department. 'The US new government's policies are supportive of inflation, so the probability of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in January is relatively small.' The Federal Reserve's 2024 December monetary policy meeting minutes show that Federal Reserve officials believe that the risk of inflation rising has increased, and the Federal Reserve has reached or is approaching the appropriate time to slow down the pace of rate cuts. Analysts believe that the US economic outlook is still uncertain, and the Federal Reserve may maintain a cautious attitude, and the subsequent rate-cutting process will continue to depend on various economic data trends. In addition to the Federal Reserve, the Swedish Central Bank, the Canadian Central Bank, and the European Central Bank will also announce their interest rate decisions this week, and the market expects all three central banks to cut interest rates by 25 basis points. The monetary policy adjustment pace of major central banks has differentiated due to differences in their economic fundamentals. Wang Youxin, a senior researcher at the China Banking Research Institute, said that due to differences in economic conditions and policy targets among countries, policy statements will also be different. The European Central Bank faces both inflation and economic recovery problems, and in addition to continuing to curb inflation, its attention to economic trends is increasing, and monetary policy will seek a balance between the two, with a general trend of remaining loose. The research department of Goldwind Company said that recent data shows that the downward trend of eurozone inflation is still continuing, especially the slowdown in service industry prices, which makes the overall inflation face more downward pressure. It is expected that the European Central Bank will likely cut interest rates by 25 basis points at this meeting, and the discussion on neutral interest rates may lead to changes in market expectations for future interest rate paths. The expectation of monetary policy direction is the driving force behind recent foreign exchange market fluctuations. Last week, the foreign exchange market fluctuated significantly, with the US dollar index falling 1.78% for the week, the largest single-week decline in over a year. Under the driving of economic data exceeding expectations and rising market risk appetite, the euro against the US dollar and the pound against the US dollar rose by more than 2% for the week. Other non-US currencies, such as the Japanese yen, were affected by the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike, and the renminbi exchange rate also showed a significant upward trend. Looking ahead, Wang Xijie believes that the US dollar may still maintain its strength in the short term, but may experience a gentle decline in the medium to long term. From the perspective of US Treasury yields, it is expected that the possibility of a significant increase in US Treasury yields is relatively small, which may also give the US dollar downward pressure in the medium to long term. The research department of Goldwind Company said that due to the previous several months of US dollar long positions being very crowded, the recent positive changes have led to adjustments in long positions, and the US dollar has entered a window period of decline. This week, the market will continue to focus on the trend of market risk appetite, and if the market risk appetite continues to rise, the US dollar may continue to be under pressure.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 03:04 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202501273309097262.html)\n\n**Fed's Interest Rate Decision to Impact Global Financial Market**\nThe Federal Reserve is set to make a crucial decision on interest rates on January 29, which will have a significant impact on the global financial market. Market analysts expect the Fed to maintain its current interest rate, but there is a possibility of a rate cut in 2025. The Fed's decision is closely watched by investors, who are concerned about the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on the US economy. Trump has publicly called for the Fed to cut interest rates, saying he knows more about interest rates than the Fed. This has raised concerns about the Fed's independence and the potential for political interference. The European Central Bank, Swedish Central Bank, Canadian Central Bank, Brazilian Central Bank, and South African Central Bank will also make decisions on interest rates this week. Market analysts expect the European Central Bank to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, while the Swedish Central Bank and Canadian Central Bank are also likely to cut rates. PIMCO's chief investment officer, Ivascyn, believes that the Fed needs to wait for further clarification on Trump's policies and US economic data before making a decision. He also notes that the current US stock and bond valuation gap is near historical extremes, and that a 'hawkish' Fed policy could put pressure on US stocks. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the US economy, the current data suggests that the US economy is showing resilience. The US job market remains stable, with low unemployment rates, and consumer confidence and spending are relatively stable. These factors make the Fed more cautious in considering further easing policies. Additionally, the persistence of inflation is a key concern for the Fed. Although inflation rates have decreased, they remain above the Fed's 2% target. Sticky inflation means that prices adjust slowly, even if economic growth slows, and inflation may remain at a higher level. This makes the Fed weigh the inflation risk when considering rate cuts. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 11:37 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8gTcB0GAv6U)\n\n**Strong US Jobs Data Makes Interest Rate Cut Less Likely**\nThe strong US jobs data has increased the likelihood of the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates steady in January or in the near future. According to Blake Guinn, head of US interest rate strategy at RBC Capital Markets, 'Before this report, cutting interest rates in January was already unlikely, and we're now looking forward to the March report before the Fed's second meeting of 2025.' Leslie Falconio, global wealth management at UBS, added, 'The question is no longer whether the Fed will stop cutting interest rates,' as reported by Yahoo Finance. She continued, 'It's highly unlikely that they will cut interest rates in March unless there's a real collapse in the inflation report next week.' The Fed officials were already concerned about the persistent inflation indicators, citing them as a reason to be cautious in 2025, along with expectations that the new administration's trade and immigration policies will add upward pressure on prices. The new evidence of a strong economy will make it difficult for the Fed to justify any further easing in monetary policy in the near future.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 12:32 AM\nSource:[okaz.com.sa](https://www.okaz.com.sa/economy/na/2178118)\n\n**Operators Bet on Single Rate Cut by Fed in 2025 After Strong Jobs Data**\nMarket operators were expecting the Federal Reserve to wait until at least June to reduce interest rates again and end its cycle of monetary easing soon after, following data that showed employers created much more jobs than expected in December. Before the monthly employment report, operators were betting that the Fed would cut rates in May and projected a 50% chance of a second rate cut before the end of the year. However, after the data, they now believe that the Fed will only make one cut in 2025, likely in June. As one operator said, 'it was a great day' for the Fed, as the strong employment numbers reduced the pressure to cut rates. The operators are now expecting a more cautious approach from the Fed, with many believing that the central bank will wait until at least June to make any further moves. 'The strong jobs report has given the Fed some breathing room,' said another operator. 'They can now take a more measured approach and wait until the economy is more stable before making any further decisions.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[UOL](https://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/reuters/2025/01/10/operadores-apostam-em-apenas-um-corte-nos-juros-pelo-fed-em-2025-apos-dados-de-emprego.htm)\n\n**Donald Trump haunts central banks primed for wary rate cuts in 2025**\nGlobal central banks are expected to cautiously cut borrowing costs in 2025, with the possibility of slower rate reductions compared to 2024. The Federal Reserve's focus has shifted to inflation concerns, while central banks such as the ECB, BOE, and others plan gradual easing amid economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Bloomberg Economics projects its aggregate measure of advanced-world interest rates to drop just 72 basis points in 2025, less than in 2024. The shifts in that gauge tell a tale of easing cycles that have already progressed, lingering caution about inflation pressures, and the unknowns posed by the impending second era of Trump. Central bankers around the world are haunted by the prospect of Trump's policies, including threatened trade tariffs that could hurt economic growth and stoke consumer prices. The Federal Reserve has already switched its attention to the danger of resurgent inflation, curbing the prospect for much easing for now. Other major counterparts, from the euro zone to the UK, are poised to keep lowering borrowing costs to aid economic growth, but with no sign of a hurry. The Bank of Japan, Bank of Canada, and Bank of Russia are also expected to make rate decisions in 2025, with the Bank of Japan likely to hike rates, the Bank of Canada to continue lowering borrowing costs, and the Bank of Russia to start reducing the policy rate between April and July 2025. The South African Reserve Bank, Mexico's central bank, and Bank Indonesia are also expected to make rate decisions in 2025, with the South African Reserve Bank likely to cut rates by 50 basis points to 7.25% by March, Mexico's central bank to continue lowering borrowing costs, and Bank Indonesia to leave rates unchanged in the first and second quarters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/donald-trump-haunts-central-banks-primed-for-wary-rate-cuts-in-2025/articleshow/116979460.cms)\n\n**Reserve Bank rate cut hopes skirt federal election decider**\nEconomists surveyed by The Australian Financial Review predict the Reserve Bank will cut interest rates in the first half of 2025, but relief for borrowers may not arrive until after the federal election.

The report states that RBI may delay its rate cut cycle due to the Federal Reserve's more aggressive monetary policy stance. Yes Bank said, 'We see the RBI delaying the start of its rate cut cycle to April 2025, given the rupee's weakness and financial market volatility.' The Federal Reserve has recently reduced its policy rate by 25 basis points, but its forward guidance has reduced the expected rate cut to 50 basis points in 2025, down from 100 basis points earlier. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted that there was strong opposition to the rate cut decision in December, suggesting that monetary policy is still restrictive, close to neutral. The report states that the Federal Reserve's decision will have an impact on global financial markets. The Fed Watch Tool is predicting no rate cut until January 2025, which is a sign of slow monetary policy easing. The rate cut has strengthened the US dollar and increased US Treasury yields, creating challenges for emerging market central banks, including the RBI. The RBI is considering easing its monetary policies to support economic growth. The report analyzes that the RBI now faces a complex balance between supporting domestic growth and managing inflation risks. The rupee's depreciation and increasing financial market volatility have made the situation more complex. Yes Bank said, 'The RBI will now have to balance inflation risks with domestic growth imperatives.' The delay in rate cut may affect India's development path, as businesses and consumers may face high borrowing costs for a long time, limiting economic activity in the near future. The RBI's monetary policy committee has kept the policy rate unchanged at 6.5% for the last 11 consecutive meetings. Meanwhile, the RBI has a new governor, Sanjay Malhotra, who will present the central bank's next monetary policy in February 2025.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 04:44 PM\nSource:[Prabhat Khabar - Hindi News](https://www.prabhatkhabar.com/business/repo-rate-rbi-may-delay-rate-cut-to-april-2025-amid-federal-reserve-bank-hawkish-stance)\n\n**RBI's Rate Cut Delayed to 2025 Amid Fed's Hawkish Stance**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is likely to delay its interest rate reduction initiatives until April 2025, according to a report from Yes Bank. This potential delay is attributed to the Federal Reserve's shift to a more hawkish approach to monetary policy, following its decision to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's comments suggest that the monetary policy stance is moving closer to neutral, impacting global financial markets. The strengthening US dollar and rising US Treasury yields pose challenges for emerging markets, including India, where the RBI must balance domestic growth against inflation risks. RBI's new governor, Sanjay Malhotra, will have to navigate these challenges as he prepares for the central bank's next policy meeting in February 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 20, 2024 09:40 AM\nSource:[devdiscourse.com](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/business/3201754-rbis-rate-cut-delayed-to-2025-amid-feds-hawkish-stance)\n\n**Fed Reduces Interest Rate Cut Forecast, Impacting European Markets**\nThe US Federal Reserve has reduced its forecast for interest rate cuts by 2025, predicting only two quarter-point reductions. This will slow down the pace of declining borrowing costs, according to Fed Chairman Powell, who cited stable unemployment and positive steps towards reducing inflation. Analysts at Bankinter expect the Fed's interest rate cycle to end in March 2026, with rates at 3.50% and 3.75%. They also predict that the European Central Bank (EZB) will not be able to lower its rates below 2.25/2.40% by April 2025. 'This will lead to the EZB being technically unable to go below 2.25/2.40% (deposits/loans), where it will already end in April 2025,' they said on their Telegram channel. The analysts also expect the stock markets to be very cool in the short term, citing a lack of room for maneuver due to inflation not decreasing and interest rates falling less than expected. 'Since inflation is not decreasing and interest rates are falling less than expected, the stock markets offer little room for maneuver after a good year 2024,' they said on their Telegram channel. The attention will also be on the Bank of England, the Norwegian Central Bank, and the Swedish Riksbank, where traders expect unchanged interest rates in the first two cases and uncertainty in the last case, with a 50% chance of a quarter-point interest rate cut and a quarter-point interest rate cut to unchanged interest rates.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 08:42 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/kurs/index/IBEX-35-7629/news/IBEX-35-fallt-nachdem-die-Fed-weniger-Kurzungen-bis-2025-vorhersagt-48624359/)\n\n**US Federal Reserve slashes interest rates for third time this year as Aussies remain hopeful RBA will follow suit in February**\nThe US Federal Reserve has cut interest rates for the third time in 2024, reducing the rate to 4.25-4.50 per cent. This move has sent the Aussie dollar plummeting to its lowest level in over two years. Despite this, Aussies remain hopeful of an interest rate drop when the Reserve Bank of Australia meets in February 2025. Markets predict a 73 per cent chance of a rate cut, with NAB's chief economist Alan Oster predicting a cut in April or May 2025. However, some experts, such as Chris Richardson from Rich Insight, believe a February rate cut is possible if the next inflation figures are low. AMP's chief economist Shane Oliver also echoed this sentiment, saying that lower inflation numbers and weaker jobs numbers could lead to a rate cut in February.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 10:52 PM\nSource:[skynews.com.au](https://www.skynews.com.au/business/finance/us-federal-reserve-slashes-interest-rates-for-third-time-this-year-as-aussies-remain-hopeful-rba-will-follow-suit-in-february/news-story/a12e71a02134c4784a4f78a518b3823c?nk=b1e6db34f2d6a08f72ead2941bc16e75-1734759839)\n\n**Federal Reserve Cuts Interest Rates to 4.5% for Third Time**\nThe Federal Reserve has lowered interest rates for the third time to 4.5%, in line with expectations of a 25-point basis point reduction. This is the third consecutive rate cut, following a 50-point basis point reduction in September and 25 points in November last year, in the last meeting of 2024 and the Biden presidency. The rate cuts come after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.5% in July 2023, the highest level in over two decades. The Federal Reserve expects to lower interest rates by 50 points in 2025 and the same in 2026. The monetary tightening policy aimed to curb inflation, which peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 after the Russian-Ukrainian war and rising prices. The inflation rate in the US had risen to 2.7% in November, in line with expectations, and the Federal Reserve aims to lower it to 2%. The monetary easing policy comes as inflation is close to the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, and an attempt to boost economic growth and strengthen the labor market. Before March 2022, interest rates were at their lowest levels between 0.0 and 0.25%, which had been maintained since the COVID-19 pandemic to stimulate economic growth, and have now risen to around 5.5% as the highest level in over 20 years. The relationship between interest rates and assets denominated in dollars is inverse, with gold having an inverse relationship with interest rates, as lower interest rates lead to a decrease in liquidity from assets, which are similar to gold in terms of reduced risks, such as bond yields and bank deposits. Oil benefits from the rate cut with the stimulation of economic growth, and thus the demand for crude, as well as cryptocurrencies, benefit from the rate cut due to the direction of investments towards high-risk assets. Stock markets, 'specifically stock shares', are known to have an inverse relationship with interest rates, as lower interest rates lower the cost of financing for companies, and thus increase their investments and expansions, leading to increased profits. With lower interest rates, investments are shifted from bank deposits and bonds with reduced yields to high-risk stocks with increased yields, in addition to the direction of investors who borrow to trade in securities in the face of low interest rates, increasing the momentum in stock markets. Real estate is naturally expected to rise in prices with lower interest rates, due to the fact that it is one of the assets that liquidity exits from bank deposits to it, in addition to the activity of the sector with the expected increase in corporate and individual borrowing. Lower interest rates support spending and consumption by individuals and companies, and boost economic growth in countries, and lower unemployment rates with the provision of new jobs due to economic expansion. On the other hand, the dollar and currencies linked to it are affected by lower interest rates, with a decline in demand for it, while other currencies benefit, excluding the dollar and linked currencies. US exports and countries with currencies linked to the dollar benefit from lower interest rates, as lower interest rates lower the value of the US currency and currencies linked to it, thus increasing the competitiveness of products from these countries externally, with lower costs for buyers there, while a decline in the dollar reduces the cost of imports for the US, as well as countries with currencies linked to the US currency. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 07:54 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2024/12/18/article_2754412.html)\n\n**Hedge Funds Think That Mobileye NV (MBLY) Will Bounce Back Soon**\nAs 2024 comes to a close, investors are focusing on the impact of tariffs on global trade and the speed and depth of the interest rate cutting cycle.

Other stocks linked to China and the German automotive industry also took a hit, with shares of Chinese stocks falling by 4.8% and German car companies falling by as much as 6.6%. However, the latest consumer price index (CPI) data shows a mixed bag of results, with inflation growing at the fastest pace since April, but two key inflationary components finally falling. The CPI data is crucial in determining whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates thrice in 2025 or increase the number of cuts to four. 'The outcome of the election has led to uncertainty and fluctuations in several sectors,' said an analyst. 'However, the latest CPI data suggests that the interest rate cutting cycle may be slowing down.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 01:06 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Dennis Shen, an economist with Scope Ratings, said, 'The case for further US rate cuts beyond this month has decreased meaningfully.'

After cooling down significantly from a 40-year high in 2022, inflation has remained at a high level for several months.

According to Dennis Shen, economist at Scope Ratings, 'The need for further interest rate cuts in the US beyond this month has significantly decreased.' He added that 'inflation has remained stable, the economy and financial markets are overheating, the slight increase in unemployment at the beginning of this year has reversed, and the incoming Trump administration poses a greater risk of short-term inflation.' The Fed will keep rates unchanged in January and then lower them again in March, with the remaining two cuts in 2025 scheduled for June and September. The inflation remains a concern, and if no further progress is made towards the central bank's inflation target, authorities may be forced to keep interest rates high to continue fighting this monetary phenomenon.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 02:52 PM\nSource:[dolarhoy.com](https://dolarhoy.com/mercado/la-fed-recortara-las-tasas-una-vez-mas-antes-de-desacelerar-la-flexibilizacion-2024121311520)\n\n**Investors Expect Fed to Cut Interest Rates in December, with Caution in 2025**\nInvestors consider it almost certain that the Federal Reserve will reduce the interest rate by 25 basis points at its meeting on December 17-18, with attention focused on the new economic projections from the authorities, which will be released along with the decision.
