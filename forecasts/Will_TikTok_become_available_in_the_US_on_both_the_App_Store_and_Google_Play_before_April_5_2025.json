Although President Trump deferred the ban for 75 days, the legislation is still in place, and companies like Apple are cautious. Saurabh Vishnubhakat, a professor at the Cardozo School of Law, says that the 75-day extension falls into a gray area, and it's ultimately up to the courts to decide whether the law has been violated. Apple could face a $5,000 fine per user they help access TikTok, which could total $500 million if 100,000 users downloaded the app. The app's return is uncertain, but it may not happen until the future of TikTok is clear, possibly through a sale or other solution, which could take weeks or months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 09:57 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2025/01/29/when-will-tiktok-be-back-in-the-apple-app-store-and-google-play-store/)\n\n**How to Install TikTok on Samsung Galaxy S25 in the US**\nAlthough the TikTok ban has been suspended for 75 days, the app is still not available in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store in the US. However, users can sideload the APK by using a VPN to connect to a server outside of the US and then downloading the app from a hosting website like APKMirror. According to the author, 'it's a few extra steps, but otherwise a pretty easy way to install TikTok onto your Galaxy S25 in the US.' The process involves downloading a VPN app, connecting to a server outside of the US, downloading the APK, and then installing it while allowing installation from unknown sources.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 06:13 PM\nSource:[androidheadlines.com](https://www.androidheadlines.com/how-to-install-tiktok-samsung-galaxy-s25-us)\n\n**Google Play to Display Verification Seal for Approved VPNs**\nGoogle Play will display a verification seal for approved VPNs, a new feature that allows users to block apps downloaded outside the Play Store. This change comes at a timely moment, as many users are resorting to potentially insecure VPNs to access TikTok, which has not returned to the Google Play or Apple App Store in the US. VPN apps, such as Nord, hide.me, and Aloha, have already been approved and received the verification seal, according to The Verge. This initiative is part of Google's efforts to make the Play Store more transparent and secure, following the introduction of privacy labels in 2022 and the display of a seal indicating when an app has undergone independent security review.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 05:01 AM\nSource:[Olhar Digital - O futuro passa primeiro aqui](https://olhardigital.com.br/2025/01/29/internet-e-redes-sociais/google-play-vai-exibir-selo-de-verificacao-para-vpns-aprovadas/)\n\n**From MrBeast to Perplexity: The Great Candidates to Acquire TikTok in the United States**\nThe deadline for Bytedance to sell TikTok in the US has been extended to 75 days, a condition set by Donald Trump's second mandate. The 'TikTok prohibition' was in effect for a few hours on January 19, but was later lifted. Trump announced the possible veto in 2020, and it became law in April 2021, prohibiting the app throughout the US and forcing companies like Apple and Google to remove it from their app stores. Trump stated that he would give TikTok more time to find buyers, and several companies have expressed interest in acquiring the platform, including Perplexity, Oracle, and Microsoft. Perplexity has proposed creating a new company called Newco with TikTok, with the government owning up to 50% of the new structure. Oracle, which manages the servers that house TikTok, is also interested in acquiring the app's infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 09:38 PM\nSource:[pledgetimes.com](https://pledgetimes.com/from-mrbeast-to-perplexity-the-great-candidates-to-acquire-tiktok-in-the-united-states/)\n\n**Will I Have TikTok If I Get a New Phone? You May, If You Have This Device**\nAfter TikTok's scheduled ban on Jan. 19, 2025, Apple and Google removed the app to avoid financial penalties. President Donald Trump pledged to negotiate a deal, allowing TikTok to restore services on existing devices. However, users who purchase new iPhones will not be able to download TikTok, as it is not available in the App Store. This has led to a surge in people buying phones with TikTok already installed, with some sellers listing devices for thousands of dollars above retail price. Android users may have better luck, with some reporting no issues upgrading their phones while still accessing TikTok. Users can still access TikTok on desktop or laptop through a web browser. Additionally, some users are reporting issues with TikTok disappearing after updating their devices to the latest software.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[Distractify](https://www.distractify.com/p/if-i-get-a-new-phone-will-tiktok-be-on-it)\n\n**When is TikTok going back on the app store?**\nTikTok briefly shut down its services in the U.S. on Jan. 18 in anticipation of a ban scheduled for Jan. 19, but restored access less than 24 hours later. The company thanked President Donald Trump for assuring that no penalties would be imposed on service providers. However, TikTok is still absent from the Apple App Store and Google Play, and users who already have the app cannot install future updates. Apple warned that the app may have performance issues and incompatibilities with future iOS and iPadOS versions. The absence is likely due to the potential fines app stores could face while discussions about the platform are ongoing, with a possible accumulated penalty of hundreds of billions of dollars. According to Apple, all apps by ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, are no longer available to U.S. users, including CapCut and Lemon8.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 09:48 AM\nSource:[We Got This Covered](https://wegotthiscovered.com/social-media/when-is-tiktok-going-back-on-the-app-store/)\n\n**TikTok's Return to App Stores Remains Uncertain Amidst Legal and Political Hurdles**\nTikTok's return to the Google and Apple app stores remains uncertain, despite recent political and legal developments providing a temporary reprieve. The app, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, was removed from US app stores and blocked for 24 hours due to controversy. The US Supreme Court has ruled that TikTok must be sold to an American company or cease operations in the US. However, a presidential executive order by Donald Trump has temporarily allowed the app to resume operations. Despite this, TikTok is not yet available for download on app stores, and users cannot update the existing app or download it anew. The main reason for the delay is the threat of sanctions for TikTok's US partners, such as Google and Apple, under US laws, which could result in fines of up to $5,000 per user per access, with a potential total cost of $850 billion. ByteDance now has a 75-day deadline to sell at least 50% of its shares to an American company. Only once this process is complete can the app be reconsidered for return to app stores, making its return before the end of the sales period unlikely. Other ByteDance apps, such as Marvel Snap, have also been removed from app stores, but some sources suggest it may return as early as next week.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 02:50 PM\nSource:[pcprofessionale.it](https://www.pcprofessionale.it/news/quando-tornera-tiktok-sugli-app-store/)\n\n**TikTok Ban in the US: Apple Removes App from App Store, Users Face Consequences**\nTikTok, a popular social media platform, is facing a contentious ban in the US, affecting users and tech giants like Apple and Google. Despite former President Trump's promise not to penalize TikTok, the ban remains in effect, and Apple has removed the app from the App Store to protect itself from potential legal risks. If the courts later decide that Trump's promise is not legally binding, Apple could face a massive fine of up to $850 billion. The ban has significant consequences for users, including the inability to reinstall the app on new devices or after data restoration. Apple has warned users that affected apps, including TikTok, will not be able to be reinstalled after deletion, restored after data transfer, or updated on new devices. Users who purchase new iPhones will not be able to install TikTok, and even transferring data from an old device to a new one will not restore the app. The only option is to use the web version of the platform, which is less complete than the original app. The ban has raised concerns about the instability of tech policies and the impact on users and platforms.\nOriginal language: vi\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 01:15 PM\nSource:[plo.vn](https://plo.vn/ky-nguyen-so/iphone-moi-se-khong-cai-duoc-tiktok-post831998.html)\n\n**Tiktok's Future in Limbo: Apple and Google Uncertain About Availability**\nTiktok has returned to the US, but Apple and Google are unsure if it should be available in their app stores. The White House executive order suspended a law that demanded Tiktok's owner, Bytedance, sell the app's US operations or face a de facto ban. However, Apple and Google have removed Tiktok from their stores, citing concerns about the law. Oracle, a cloud computing provider, has not canceled the service in the US, and Trump has suggested buying Tiktok. The Chinese government has indicated a greater openness to a transaction, but legal experts warn that Apple and Google have reasons to be cautious. A court could tolerate a temporary suspension of the law, but it is less likely to accept a total repudiation of the law. The writing of the order could also generate concerns for third parties that work with Tiktok, exposing them to the risk of legal actions by non-state entities. The promise not to prosecute companies for violating legislation offers a 'minimum security', but Trump could change his mind and selectively enforce the statute against the companies he fights. The absence of Tiktok in online stores means that it could stop working for US users, and the app's ability to solve security problems is also a concern. Apple and Google are looking for a Tiktok transaction that does not raise legal issues.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[whatsnew2day.com](https://whatsnew2day.com/tiktok-could-work-badly-the-future-of-the-application-in-limbo-since-it-remains-outside-the-us-application-stores/)\n\n**TikTok-Installed Smartphones Sold for Thousands of Dollars in the US**\nSince January 19, TikTok has been unavailable for download on Google Play Store and Apple's App Store in the US. However, some individuals are taking advantage of this situation by selling smartphones with TikTok already installed for thousands of dollars on platforms like eBay. The 'Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act' (PAFACA) adopted by the US Congress in April 2024 imposes severe sanctions on technical providers who defy the ban. As a result, some users are selling their smartphones with TikTok installed for up to $50,000, although most offers are between $5,000 and $20,000. According to TikTok Policy, the application should be restored soon. 'The downloads of this application are suspended due to current legal requirements in the US,' states the Google Play Store. 'TikTok and other ByteDance applications are not available in the country or region where you are,' adds the App Store.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[Franceinfo](https://www.francetvinfo.fr/sciences/high-tech/etats-unis-des-smartphones-equipes-de-tiktok-vendus-plusieurs-milliers-de-dollars_7034210.html)\n\n**TikTok Still Not Available in US Despite Trump's Announcement**\nDespite Donald Trump's announcement to allow TikTok in the US, the app is still not available on Apple and Google stores.

Google Play only warns users that the download of the app is on hold due to 'current US legal requirements.' Trump had signed a decree to suspend the ban on TikTok for 75 days, allowing ByteDance to sell the app. However, Elon Musk's potential acquisition of TikTok has not yet led to the app's availability in the US.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 09:19 PM\nSource:[Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/vida/tecnologia/por-que-tiktok-aun-no-esta-en-apple-y-google-a-pesar-del-anuncio-de-donald-trump/)\n\n**TikTok Still Not Available in US App Store and Google Play Store**\nTikTok is facing a difficult situation in the United States. After the US Supreme Court upheld a law that suspends the use of the app due to security concerns, ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, announced that it would temporarily suspend its services in the US. However, Donald Trump granted a 90-day extension for TikTok to operate in the US, and has proposed that the company be 50% owned by an American entity. Trump has also suggested that Elon Musk buy TikTok. Despite the uncertain future of the app, TikTok is still not available in the US App Store and Google Play Store. According to The Verge, searching for TikTok in the App Store displays a message saying that the app is not available in the user's country or region. Google Play also states that downloads of the app are paused due to current US legal requirements. Apple explains on its support page that it is obligated to follow laws in the jurisdictions where it operates, and that TikTok and other ByteDance apps will no longer be available for download or update in the US App Store after January 19, 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 12:29 PM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/aplicaciones/apple-google-siguen-sin-incluir-tiktok-tiendas-aplicaciones-5674934/)\n\n**TikTok Remains Unavailable on Apple and Google Stores in the US**\nDespite the delay in the ban, the 'TikTok' app remains unavailable on Apple and Google stores in the US, on Tuesday, a day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to postpone for 75 days the implementation of a ban on the short-form video app owned by China. The app resumed services after Trump's assurances that the company and its partners would not face significant fines if the app continued to operate, but it is still not available on app stores. Analysts suspect that the delay is due to Apple and Google waiting for additional protection before bypassing the ban that punishes companies for hosting or distributing the app. Apple stated on its app store: 'TikTok and other apps by ByteDance and others are not available in this country or region.' Google Play said: 'The downloads for this app have been temporarily suspended due to the current legal requirements in the US.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 05:33 PM\nSource:[aawsat.com](https://aawsat.com/%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82/5103710-%D8%B1%D8%BA%D9%85-%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B8%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%83-%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%83-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%BA%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7)\n\n**TikTok Remains Unavailable on US App Stores Amid Ongoing Ban**\nTikTok, a Chinese video-sharing app, remains unavailable for download on Apple's App Store and Google Play in the US.

The law states that providers like Oracle, Apple, and Google would be fined for having the app available, not the users, so they have no incentive to get TikTok back into the app store during the 75-day extension.

The US Supreme Court had ruled on Friday that ByteDance, the company that owns TikTok, must sell its video-sharing app by January 19, 2025, to avoid a ban in the US. Trump announced on social media that he plans to sign an executive order on Monday, giving ByteDance an additional 90 days to find a buyer. He suggested that US investors should acquire 50% of the US subsidiary of the app. The law, which was passed by a majority of both parties in the US Congress in April, requires app stores to ban TikTok if it is not sold by January 19. Trump called on internet users and app stores in the US (Apple Store and Google Play) to make the app available again on their platforms. In a statement released on Saturday, the Chinese company announced that it would be forced to stop operating its app in the US on January 19, unless the Biden administration guarantees that the law will not be enforced. The app, which has been closed since Saturday evening, is still unavailable in the US today. After Trump's announcement, the company stated that it is working to restore its services in the US market. The company thanked Trump on its official account on X for providing the necessary clarity and reassurance to its service providers that they will not face any penalties if TikTok is made available.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 02:20 AM\nSource:[telexpresse.com](https://telexpresse.com/370052.html)\n\n**TikTok Removed from App Store and Play Store Amid US Ban**\nApple and Google have removed TikTok from the App Store and Play Store, respectively, following the start of the US ban on the app. This comes despite former US President Trump's earlier promise to give TikTok a 90-day grace period. The ban, which began on January 19, is a result of a law passed by the US administration in April 2024, which requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell the app or face a ban in the US due to national security concerns. The US Supreme Court upheld the law on Friday. According to NBC New York, TikTok has been removed from the App Store, with a message saying 'the app is not available in your country' for users trying to download the app. On the Google Play Store, a message on the app's previous installation page reads 'Sorry, we were unable to find the requested URL on this server.' TikTok said on Friday that the app would stop working, meaning it would no longer be available for use in the US, unless the Biden administration intervenes. The law requires service providers to stop supporting TikTok in the US, which means companies like Google, Apple, and Oracle will face severe penalties if they continue to work with TikTok. Former US President Trump, who will be sworn in on Monday, said in a statement on Saturday that he is likely to give TikTok a 90-day extension to the deadline for the ban. He added that he may make an announcement on the matter on Monday, saying 'I think it will be, certainly, something we'll consider.' He continued, 'Extending it for 90 days is something that's likely to happen, because it's reasonable. As you know, it's reasonable. We'll consider it carefully. It's a big deal.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 02:39 PM\nSource:[almasryalyoum.com](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/3356334)\n\n**Google Play Store now says TikTok 'isn't available'**\nThe Google Play Store has removed TikTok from its platform, displaying a banner message that says 'This app isn't available.'

This comes after the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) was signed into law on April 24, 2024, requiring the Google Play Store and Apple App Store to remove TikTok from distribution. According to the law, both companies face fines of $5,000 per US user/day if they don't comply.

The law was approved by the US Senate in April 2024, citing security concerns over the app's access to data from 170 million US users. The US Supreme Court has ratified the ban, but the situation may change if TikTok is sold to a new owner before January 19. According to Kate Ruane, director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology, the ban does not mean that the app will disappear automatically from users' phones or that users will be penalized for logging in. However, it will become increasingly difficult for US users to access the app, and the service will deteriorate over time. The app's developers have warned that users who have downloaded TikTok may still be able to use it, but it will not be possible to download or update the app from the Google Play Store or App Store. The decision of the US Supreme Court was announced three days before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has expressed his intention to negotiate a resolution that would save the platform while addressing national security concerns. The White House has also commented on the issue, stating that the Biden administration recognizes that the implementation of the law will fall to the next administration, which will take office on Monday.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 18, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[chequeado.com](https://chequeado.com/el-explicador/que-se-sabe-sobre-el-posible-cierre-de-tiktok-en-los-estados-unidos/)\n\n**TikTok to be Closed in the United States on January 19, 2025**\nTikTok will be closed in the United States on January 19, 2025, due to a law that requires the Chinese company ByteDance to sell the app to an American company or shut down its operations in the country. The law was approved by the US Senate in April 2024 for national security reasons and to prevent the leakage of data from over 170 million Americans. If ByteDance is unable to revoke the demand, the app will no longer be available in the US, affecting over 170 million users. However, users who have the app installed on their devices will still be able to access it, but it will become increasingly difficult to use as updates will no longer be available. It is unclear whether the decision will also affect Mexico and other countries, but users are waiting for any announcement from ByteDance. As stated by the law, the app will no longer be available in app stores such as App Store and Google Play. 'It's possible that some users may think they will be sanctioned for simply logging in to the platform, but that's not the case,' said a spokesperson. 'Those who continue to use TikTok will still be able to access it, but it will become increasingly difficult to use over time.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 10:22 PM\nSource:[ensedeciencia.com](https://ensedeciencia.com/2025/01/17/adios-a-tiktok-esta-es-la-fecha-en-la-que-cerraran-la-popular-plataforma-de-videos/)\n\n**Will TikTok still be available in the US after January 19?**\nThe future of TikTok in the United States is uncertain after January 19, when the US Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether the app should be banned. If the ban is implemented, the 170 million US users could be affected. However, according to The New York Times, the law passed by Congress last year only prohibits app stores like App Store and Google Play from distributing or publishing TikTok updates. This means that users who already have the app installed can continue to use it, although they will not receive new updates. The app may degrade over time without updates, but some advertisers still trust its use in the US. TikTok may also block access to its videos for US users after January 19 as part of its strategy to comply with the law and avoid further consequences. Users may still be able to access TikTok using a VPN, which can hide their location and bypass restrictions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 05:03 PM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/data/puedo-seguir-usando-tiktok-en-estados-unidos-si-lo-prohiben-a-partir-del-19-de-enero-app-store-google-play-nnda-nnni-noticia/)\n\n",
