According to Eun Myung-soon, CEO of SGI\uc11c\uc6b8\ubcf4\uc99d, 'Seoul Guarantee Insurance has played a role in activating credit transactions across the entire Korean industry for 56 years, and through this IPO, we aim to solidify our position as the country's only comprehensive guarantee insurance company and become a representative dividend-paying stock through more aggressive shareholder reduction policies.' SGI\uc11c\uc6b8\ubcf4\uc99d plans to sell 6.982 million shares, or 10% of the total issued shares, to major shareholders, including the Deposit Insurance Corporation of Korea, which holds 93.85% of the company's shares. The expected price range for the IPO is 26,000-31,800 won per share, a 30% reduction from the previous IPO price band. The company has also established a new shareholder reduction policy, which includes paying a dividend of 200 billion won in 2024, which will be distributed to shareholders in April. This represents a dividend yield of 9-11% based on the expected IPO price range. The company has also set a goal of providing a total shareholder reduction of 200 billion won per year for the next three years. Additionally, SGI\uc11c\uc6b8\ubcf4\uc99d plans to introduce a minimum dividend policy to increase the predictability of shareholder returns. The company will announce the specific amount of the minimum dividend in the first half of this year. The IPO is expected to take place on March 14, with subscription period from March 5-6.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 06:49 AM\nSource:[\uba54\ud2b8\ub85c\uc2e0\ubb38](https://metroseoul.co.kr/article/20250219500513)\n\n**New Paradigm Investment Announces 2024 Investment Results and 2025 Plans**\nNew Paradigm Investment announced its 2024 investment results and 2025 startup investment plans on February 19.

The valuations of some of the largest private fintech companies, such as Stripe and Ramp, increased, and the stocks of publicly traded companies, such as Affirm, Coinbase, and Robinhood, rose. However, global funding for private fintechs continued to decline, reaching $34 billion last year, compared to $42 billion in 2023 and a record $144 billion in 2021, according to CB Insights. Our new Fintech 50 list of 2025 is filled with entrepreneurs who have found ways to thrive in this limited and sometimes turbulent environment. Companies that provide services to other businesses (most of which are included in our Payment, Corporate Banking, and Wall Street and Companies categories) performed particularly well, taking 31 of the total 50 spots. These three categories also represent 13 of the 18 companies that made their debut in the Fintech 50 list this year. 'We analyzed hundreds of companies and evaluated everything from business growth and product innovation to leadership team diversity,' said our team of 10 journalists and editors. 'We interviewed both CEOs and industry experts. To be considered, emerging fintechs must have their headquarters or substantial operations in the US and not be part of a public company.' The companies that made it to the list were selected based on their growth, innovation, and leadership team diversity. 'We're seeing a lot of innovation in the fintech space, and it's exciting to see companies like Parafin and Squire making a big impact,' said Stacy Greiner, CEO of DailyPay. 'We're proud to be part of the Fintech 50 list and look forward to continuing to innovate and disrupt the financial services industry.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 05:53 PM\nSource:[Forbes M\u00e9xico](https://forbes.com.mx/estas-son-las-50-startups-fintech-mas-prometedoras-de-2025/)\n\n**They've Been Waiting Years to Go Public. They're Still Waiting.**\nTuro, a car rental start-up, has canceled its initial public offering (IPO) due to market uncertainty. The company's CEO, Andre Haddad, stated, 'Now is not the right time.' Despite President Trump's pro-business administration, the IPO market has been slow due to factors such as tariffs, regulatory changes, and inflation. According to Phil Haslett, a founder of EquityZen, the calendar for IPOs has gone from fully booked to wide open in three weeks. While some companies, like Klarna and eToro, have confidentially filed to list their shares, many valuable private tech companies, including Stripe and Databricks, plan to stay private by raising capital from the private market. David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, said that start-ups can get the capital they need from private investors, making it easier for them to stay private. The number and size of tender offerings have grown, allowing employees and shareholders to cash out and reducing the pressure to go public. Companies like Justworks and Navan have delayed or scrapped their IPO plans due to market volatility and poor performance of listed companies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/technology/theyve-been-waiting-years-to-go-public-theyre-still-waiting.html)\n\n**Circle IPO: How to Buy Circle Stock in 2025?**\nCircle, a digital currency company, is not yet publicly traded, but it has filed for a US IPO in early 2024. The company's USD Coin (USDC) stablecoin has a market capitalization of $56.5 billion, making it the 7th largest cryptocurrency. Circle offers a range of products and services, including trading services through its platform, and has a focus on institutional clients through its Circle Invest services. According to valuations from previous funding rounds, Circle's potential IPO valuation could be in the range of $7-9 billion. A Circle representative noted, 'Becoming a U.S.-listed public company has long been part of Circle\u2019s strategic aspirations,' but declined to comment on rumors. It is possible that Circle will go public sometime in 2025, and investors can gain indirect exposure to the company by investing in companies with an equity stake in it, such as Coinbase.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 01:15 PM\nSource:[coincodex.com](https://coincodex.com/article/35620/circle-stock/)\n\n**IPO News Today Live Updates on February 18, 2025 : Hexaware Technologies IPO allotment date likely today; Latest GMP, steps to check share allotment status online**\nThe article provides live updates on initial public offerings (IPOs) on February 18, 2025.

Shein aims to go public in London in the first half of this year. In early February, Reuters reported that Shein was planning to cut its valuation for the London IPO to around $50 billion, which is nearly a quarter less than the company's $66 billion fundraising value in 2023. Shein's IPO in London is subject to approval from UK and Chinese regulators. The Financial Times reported last week that Shein's IPO may be delayed until the second half of this year due to the decision by US President Donald Trump to end the duty-free importation 'de minimis' arrangement.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 04:27 PM\nSource:[forbes.com.mx](https://forbes.com.mx/shein-enfrenta-presion-de-inversores-para-recortar-la-valoracion-a-30000-mdd-antes-de-la-salida-a-bolsa/)\n\n**From IPOs To Exits, Cross-Border Payments Is Set For An Active Year In The Markets**\nThe cross-border payments industry is expected to have an active year in 2025, with several companies planning to go public through IPOs or direct listings. However, the market conditions are different from 2021, when a flurry of cross-border payments players made their public entries. The financial landscape has changed, with enthusiasm for SPACs disappearing and concerns about turbulence and volatility due to provocative policies from the incoming US administration. Payments processor Stripe's valuation has dropped from $95bn in 2021 to $65bn in 2024, and investors will be looking to get the best possible return on their investment. Some companies, such as Ebury and Klarna, have already appointed banks to begin the IPO process, while others, like MoneyGram, have been exploring the option of being acquired by private equity players.

According to the article, 'the report would be quite in favor of US investors' if Chime's year-on-year growth is assessed.

According to David Sykes, Klarna's chief commercial officer, the company has already doubled the number of new merchants in the three months since implementing the new integration with Stripe.

The list includes Cerebras Systems, CoreWeave, Snyk, SymphonyAI, Stripe, Klarna, Revolut, Hinge Health, Element Biosciences, Navan, StubHub, Discord, and Canva. These companies have shown significant growth and have the potential to meet the requirements for a successful IPO. Cerebras Systems, for example, has already filed to go public and is expected to do so soon. CoreWeave has raised $1.1 billion in funding and is valued at $19 billion. Snyk has grown its revenue by 50% and has cut its losses by 33%. SymphonyAI has hired a new CFO who has experience leading companies to IPOs.

After a challenging adjustment period following the Covid-19 pandemic, fintech startups are optimistic about new technologies like stablecoins and increased deal activity. According to Amias Gerety, partner at QED Investors, 'It will have an immediate impact on tone, and you\u2019ll have a relatively swift change in terms of the experiments people are willing to do, the things they think about prioritizing.' The Ark Fintech Innovation ETF rose about 34% in 2024, and publicly traded fintech companies are expected to bounce back. Buy-now, pay-later firm Klarna and neobank Chime Financial Inc. have filed for initial public offerings, and Stripe Inc. and Plaid Inc. are other closely watched IPO contenders. Fintech venture funding has slowed to pre-pandemic levels, but investors are expecting to see similar deals take shape in 2025. The incoming administration's pro-crypto agenda is likely to put wind in the sails of efforts to utilize technologies like stablecoins, especially for those trying to expand internationally. Payment processor Stripe's $1.1 billion acquisition of stablecoin issuing startup Bridge was motivated by a desire to build global payments infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[businessmirror.com.ph](https://businessmirror.com.ph/2025/01/05/regulation-deals-and-crypto-fintech-themes-to-watch-in-25/)\n\n**Prediction: 3 Highly Anticipated IPO Stocks Will Hit the Market in 2025 | The Motley Fool**\nThe stock market had a strong year in 2024, with the S&P 500 advancing 23%.

What 2025 Could Hold For Fintechs Eyeing Public Markets**\nThe fintech sector may be gearing up for a resurgence in public markets in 2025, after years of turbulence. Companies like Chime Financial, Stripe, Klarna, and Circle are signaling a potential comeback in the IPO market. The sector faced significant headwinds in recent years, including overhyped valuations and shaky business models, but is now positioning itself to take advantage of improved conditions. Fintechs are refining their operations and ensuring stronger fundamentals and clearer paths to profitability before going public. The optimism around 2025 is warranted, but fintechs considering an IPO would do well to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors, such as Robinhood and Ant Group. Stripe's potential IPO could be the crown jewel of the 2025 fintech wave, and its success could set a positive tone for other fintechs. The IPO landscape isn't limited to the U.S., with regional fintechs in Southeast Asia and Europe also preparing for public listings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2024 08:02 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zennonkapron/2024/12/23/the-ipo-comeback-what-2025-could-hold-for-fintechs-eyeing-public-markets/)\n\n",

Given that Stripe has been a key player in the fintech space and has had considerable success in fundraising rounds valuing the company highly, an IPO announcement within the near term to capitalize on these valuations is probable. According to PitchBook and CB Insights data, the average time for highly valued tech companies from the last major funding round to IPO announcement is typically around 1-2 years. Thus, given Stripe's most recent rounds and its market growth, there is a reasonable likelihood of an IPO announcement soon.
