The majority of these cases were related to 'other processed foods', which include products such as 'Hwachunhwan' and 'Boswelia-hwan'. These products accounted for 15 cases, a 5-fold increase from the previous year. The increase in cases of other processed foods is attributed to some companies violating food safety laws by selling multiple types of processed foods without proper registration and notification. One such company, Je-hwan-so in Daegu, was found to have sold five types of products that were not registered or notified, and were subsequently suspended and recalled in November 2024. The 'Hwachunhwan' product, in particular, was found to have used an unapproved ingredient, 'Bogolji', which is not suitable for use as a food ingredient. Another product, 'Cheongeumchae-hwan', was found to contain the food poisoning bacteria 'Clostridium perfringens'. Other cases of food sales suspension and recall include a product made from fresh barley, which was found to have violated food safety laws. In contrast, the number of cases related to instant-cooked foods decreased from 18 in 2023 to 5 in 2024. The most common reasons for food sales suspension and recall in 2024 were non-compliance with food standards (67 cases), followed by food safety law violations (15 cases), and food labeling and advertising law violations (13 cases).\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 09:28 PM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20250124144800017)\n\n**USDA issues health alert for Wegmans chicken nuggets due to bone fragments**\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service issued a public health alert for frozen, fully cooked Wegmans breaded chicken breast nuggets due to possible contamination with bone fragments.

The cases are from eight states, including California, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee. CDC stated that seven of the cases are related to pregnancy. In Tennessee, a mother and her infant both contracted Listeria, resulting in the infant's death. In California, a mother and her twin infants were infected, with both infants dying. However, since Listeria was only found in the mother and one infant's samples, only the mother and one infant are included in the current outbreak's confirmed cases. The outbreak is linked to Yu Shang Food, Inc.'s ready-to-eat products, including poultry, pork, and beef items, which are sold nationwide and available online. The CDC noted, 'The true number of people infected may be higher than the reported number, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states where cases have been reported.' The US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) initially announced a recall of Yu Shang Food, Inc.'s products on November 9, 2024, and updated the notice on November 25, 2024, to include all ready-to-eat products produced by the company before October 28, 2024. Listeria infection can cause symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, headache, neck stiffness, confusion, loss of balance, and seizures, and may also lead to diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. Invasive infections can spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. Pregnant women who contract Listeria may experience miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, or newborn infection, which can be life-threatening. Additionally, older adults and people with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to severe and potentially life-threatening infections.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 11, 2024 11:39 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/24/12/11/n14389321.htm)\n\n**CDPH Urges Consumers Not to Eat Yu Shang Food, Inc.
