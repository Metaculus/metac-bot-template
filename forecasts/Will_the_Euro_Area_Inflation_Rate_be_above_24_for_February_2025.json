The index fell by 1 point to -22.4 by February, with a decrease in income expectations and purchase intentions potentially linked to an increase in inflation. The German Ministry of Economic Affairs adjusted its GDP growth forecast for 2025 from 1.1% to 0.3%, underscoring the need for continued monetary policy easing by the ECB. Market participants are anticipating further rate cuts from the ECB, with expectations of a quarter-point reduction this coming Thursday and additional cuts later this year. This could lead to a decline in the euro against the dollar and pound, influenced by technical factors. The EURUSD pair is likely to consolidate below the 1.05 level, which could lead to declines below parity. The euro also seems weaker compared to the pound, with the EURGBP pair declining for the fifth consecutive trading session. The euro has been depreciating against the pound since October 2023, and consolidation below the 0.8250 level could result in a fundamental reassessment of attitudes towards the euro.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 04:02 PM\nSource:[actionforex.com](https://www.actionforex.com/contributors/fundamental-analysis/584401-euro-pressured-by-german-pessimism/)\n\n**Pension Payments for February 2025: Poste to Pay Two Days Earlier than Banks**\nMillions of pensioners can expect to receive their February 2025 pension payments at the beginning of the month, as usual. The Inps has published the payment details on its website, allowing pensioners to check their pension amount and composition online. However, due to a 'calendar joke', those with a Poste account will receive their payments two days earlier than those with a bank account. The payment will be made on the first working day of February, which falls on a Saturday. Poste will make the payments starting from Saturday, February 1, while bank accounts will receive the payment on Monday, February 3. The Inps advises those collecting their pension in person to visit the post office in the late morning or afternoon, and to avoid the first day. Additionally, the minimum pension will increase by 2.2% from January 1, 2025, resulting in a monthly increase of 13.27 euros, bringing the minimum pension to 616.67 euros. The Inps explains that the minimum pension is 603.40 euros, with an additional 0.8% increase to account for inflation, up to a maximum of 2,394.44 euros per month.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 11:12 AM\nSource:[quotidiano.net](https://www.quotidiano.net/economia/pensioni-febbraio-2025-r35uqp0q)\n\n**EUR/GBP falls below 0.8400 as continuing losing streak due to a potential ECB rate cut**\nThe EUR/GBP currency pair has fallen below 0.8400 due to a potential European Central Bank (ECB) rate cut. The ECB is expected to lower its Deposit Facility rate by 25 basis points to 2.75% on Thursday, driven by the sluggish economic outlook in the Eurozone and confidence that inflation will return to the ECB's 2% target. Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer emphasized that economic growth is his top priority, highlighting signs that the economy is starting to recover. However, the Pound Sterling (GBP) remains under pressure amid rising concerns over the risk of stagflation in the UK economy, driven by weakening labor demand and persistent inflation. Traders are pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut in the Bank of England's (BoE) first monetary policy decision of 2025 on February 6, which would bring borrowing rates down to 4.5%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 07:29 AM\nSource:[FXStreet](https://www.fxstreet.com/news/eur-gbp-falls-below-08400-as-continuing-losing-streak-due-to-a-potential-ecb-rate-cut-202501290712)\n\n**MNI Eurozone Inflation Preview - January 2025**\nThe Eurozone January flash inflation round will set the tone for inflation developments in 2025. The MNI median of sell-side forecasts points to headline inflation at 2.4-2.5% Y/Y and core inflation at 2.7% Y/Y. The ECB is expected to cut rates by 25bps at its January 30 meeting, with a subsequent 25bp cut in March almost fully priced. However, there remains uncertainty around the speed and magnitude of cuts beyond Q1, with inflation data a key input into those decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[marketnews.com](https://marketnews.com/mni-eurozone-inflation-preview-january-2025-1738169649065)\n\n**ECB Prepares to Lower Interest Rates Amid Inflation and Weak Growth**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is preparing to lower interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, due to inflation approaching the 2% target and weak growth. This would be the lowest level since February 2023. However, despite the expected rate cut, the ECB's management may face uncertainty due to the increasing US tariffs. Goldman Sachs economist Sven Jari Stehn expects the ECB to cut rates further in 2025, with a potential target of 1.5%. Francesco Pesole from ING believes that the ECB's message will repeat and trigger a wave of low-interest rates in the Eurozone. Bank of America predicts that the ECB will lower interest rates in both January and March, and eventually reach the potential target of 1.5%. However, Ruben Segura-Cayuela from Bank of America warns that the new rate cut may be delayed until after March due to the volatility in core inflation. The ECB's delegation in Davos acknowledged that inflation risks are differentiating between the US and the Eurozone, and that European inflation concerns are less severe. They also did not mention the upward inflation risk from energy prices.

In contrast, the European Central Bank (BCE) is expected to continue its interest rate reduction cycle in January, given the region's expected 1% growth in 2025, down from 0.7% in 2024. The core eurozone economies are facing both cyclical and structural headwinds, as well as uncertainty over future trade and tariffs, which could lead to lower growth in the region. However, the general scenario of disinflation remains intact, with the global and core eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rates standing at 2.4% and 2.7% respectively. In the short term, the region's structural challenges, commercial uncertainty, and political paralysis, ahead of the German federal election at the end of February, paint a negative picture of European prospects in 2025. Nevertheless, the region's financial conditions are easing, aided by expectations of a rapid withdrawal of the BCE's restrictive policy and a weak euro. A potential reform of Germany's debt brake after the German election could also contribute to reducing the risks facing the region. From a strategic perspective, we prefer shortening the yield curve in the US and Germany, as we believe that term premia are still too low on these two markets. We also prefer exposure to duration in countries that offer a better risk-return ratio, in markets that currently evaluate a shorter interest rate reduction cycle, and where real yields seem relatively attractive. In this context, we prefer a tactical short position on US duration. We also prefer to hold protection against US inflation, given the orientation of US monetary and fiscal policy and the potential risks of higher inflation resulting from US trade and immigration policies.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 07:35 AM\nSource:[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com/bourse/actualites/la-fed-en-pause-la-bce-devrait-maintenir-son-cycle-de-baisse-des-taux-en-janvier-5176de42ae554611f2a9f43ddc511438)\n\n**Eurozone Economic Forecasts: A Mixed Picture**\nA recent survey by Dow Jones Newswires among European banks forecasts economic growth and inflation rates for the Eurozone.

The monthly inflation rate is expected to be 0.85% in January, 0.82% in February, and 0.79% in March. The year-over-year inflation rate is expected to remain at 8.6% in January and 8.46% in March. The AERC attributes the revision to the weakening of the national currency, the tenge, and the increase in the base rate of the National Bank of Kazakhstan. The experts also note that the growth of the money supply and the inflationary expectations of the population are contributing factors. The inflation rate in Russia was 9.51% in December, and the index of food prices of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) showed a decline in the last month of 2024. The year-over-year inflation rate in the Eurozone increased to 2.4% in December, and the base inflation rate rose by 0.5% in the same month. The AERC expects the global oil prices to remain in the range of $80.44-$84.75 per barrel, which will contribute to the strengthening of the national currency. However, the experts note that the factor of oil prices has an ambivalent effect on Kazakhstan's inflation in conditions of high geopolitical tension. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 07:08 AM\nSource:[Zakon.kz](https://www.zakon.kz/finansy/6464984-kak-vyrastut-tseny-v-kazakhstane-v-I-kvartale-2025-goda--eksperty.html)\n\n**Kazakhstan's Inflation Forecast Revised for Q1 2025**\nThe Analytical Center of the Republic of Kazakhstan (AERC) has revised its inflation forecast for the first quarter of 2025.

The core inflation rate, excluding energy, remains slightly higher but is decreasing. The US is seen as a possible exception due to its strong economy and labor market, with a projected GDP growth rate of 2.7% in the fourth quarter. However, concerns about tariffs and deportations could contribute to inflation. Ramenghi believes that these concerns are excessive and that the market is underestimating the possibility of further monetary policy easing. He expects the Fed to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in 2025, leading to a decrease in Treasury yields to 4% by mid-2025. In Europe, the economy is expected to continue to depend on government spending and exports, which are facing increasing trade tensions. Germany is heading towards elections on February 23, and a new government may introduce fiscal stimuli. France is trying to pass a budget law in a unstable parliamentary context, with a projected deficit of 5.5% in 2025. Ramenghi considers the French public debt to be the most significant threat to European bond markets in the short term. The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut interest rates by 1 percentage point in 2024 and is expected to do the same in 2025, bringing the deposit rate to 2%. However, it is unclear if this will be enough, given the fragile economic growth and American protectionism. This phase is expected to be favorable for euro-denominated bonds, with investment-grade bonds offering attractive yields and potential for appreciation in case of a more significant economic slowdown.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 09:33 AM\nSource:[investmentworld.it](https://www.investmentworld.eu/it/ubs-wm-tassi-e-dintorni/)\n\n**Eurostat Confirms Eurozone Inflation Rate at 2.4% in December**\nEurostat confirmed that the inflation rate in the Eurozone rose to 2.4% in December, up from 2.2% in November.

The core HICP, excluding food and energy, also matched expectations at 2.7% year-over-year. Energy prices, which have a significant impact on inflation, contributed to the increase, but the ECB does not expect this to be a major concern. Service prices rose 4.0% year-over-year, exceeding expectations, while good prices rose 0.5%, slightly below expectations. Germany reported a higher-than-expected inflation rate of 2.9% year-over-year, mainly due to core inflation, but the CPI calculation method changed in December, making it difficult to understand the trend. Italy and the Netherlands reported lower-than-expected inflation data, which balanced out the overall Eurozone inflation numbers. A Deutsche Bank analyst commented on the inflation data, saying that the ECB's policy approach focuses on broader economic trends rather than individual data points. They noted that service inflation has maintained a rate of around 4% year-over-year, while service price growth has slowed. Domestic inflation is still high, but slowing, and wage growth is also easing. Deutsche Bank maintains an optimistic outlook, expecting the slowdown in service inflation to contribute to a decline in overall inflation. They predict that the HICP inflation rate will fall below the ECB's target of 2% from February, which could lead to the ECB adopting a policy interest rate below neutral by 2025. The economist concludes that today's inflation numbers did not show a significant negative surprise, supporting the prediction that the ECB will adopt a cautious policy easing at its January meeting.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:57 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u65e5\u672c](https://jp.investing.com/news/economy-news/article-93CH-974342)\n\n**Euro area inflation aligns with forecasts, Deutsche sees more cuts from ECB By Investing.com**\nThe euro area's Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) inflation rate for December matched expectations at 2.44% year-over-year and 0.1% month-over-month.

The ECB previously stated that inflation would edge higher into year-end 2024, but drop sustainably to the 2% target in 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[marketnews.com](https://marketnews.com/mni-brief-euro-area-consumer-inflation-expectations-edge-up-1736240400382)\n\n**European Central Bank Cuts Key Interest Rates by 25 Basis Points**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to lower its three key interest rates by 25 basis points, marking the fourth time this year. The new rates will be 3.00% for the euro area deposit facility rate, 3.15% for the main refinancing rate, and 3.40% for the marginal lending rate. The new rates will take effect on December 18. The ECB also released its latest inflation forecast, predicting that the euro area inflation rate will be 2.4% in 2024, 2.1% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026, and 2.1% in 2027. The core inflation rate, excluding energy and food, is expected to be 2.9% in 2024, 2.3% in 2025, 1.9% in 2026, and 1.9% in 2027. The ECB has also lowered its economic growth forecast, predicting that the euro area economy will grow by 0.7% in 2024, 1.1% in 2025, 1.4% in 2026, and 1.3% in 2027. 'The euro area inflation will remain stable around the 2% medium-term target,' the ECB said in a statement. 'Despite some easing in market conditions, the current monetary policy remains restrictive, and the lagged effects of previous rate hikes continue to tighten financing conditions.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 12, 2024 11:31 PM\nSource:[news.cn](http://www.news.cn/fortune/20241212/d63ef7a9e4e547adb2a21520bc04cdfb/c.html)\n\n**ECB Cuts Interest Rates Despite Rising Inflation**\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) has lowered the interest rates for the fourth time this year, despite rising inflation. The key interest rate is now 3% - 0.25 percentage points lower than before. The inflation rates in Germany and the Eurozone have risen slightly in recent months, with prices for services, such as healthcare and hospitality, increasing significantly, while energy prices have decreased. The ECB expects inflation to return to 2% next year, which is the ECB's target rate. The lower interest rates will make borrowing cheaper, but mortgage rates may not be affected immediately. According to Verivox, the average interest rate for savings accounts with a two-year term is now 2.34%, the lowest level since February 2023. The ECB's decision aims to boost the economy, which is expected to grow by 0.8% this year in the Eurozone. However, Germany may be heading into a recession for the second year in a row, and the outlook for 2025 is not positive, with a predicted stagnation of the gross domestic product. The weak economy is also affecting the labor market, with many companies in the automotive and machinery industries planning to lay off thousands of employees. Despite this, the unemployment rate in Germany remains relatively low at 5.9% in November, and the unemployment rate in the Eurozone is at a record low of 6.3%.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 12, 2024 01:24 PM\nSource:[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/ezb-leitzinsen-inflation-li.3165253)\n\n**BCE's Next Move: A Complex Economic and Political Landscape**\nThe European Central Bank (BCE) is facing a complex economic and political landscape, with the election of Donald Trump as US President, the threat of new tariffs, and economic and political turmoil in France and Germany. The euro has also weakened significantly. In this context, the BCE must decide on its next move. Reinhard Cluse, chief economist at UBS, notes that the negative impact on the eurozone's GDP should be slightly greater than the impact on inflation. However, Christine Lagarde, BCE president, warns that a trade war of this scale would be 'negative for all'. The two main European economies, France and Germany, are experiencing severe political and economic crises. In France, the government is without a majority, the Prime Minister has been censured, and the 2025 budget has not been voted. The French debt is at record levels, putting pressure on the country. In Germany, the country is in recession and facing a major political crisis. The coalition government has collapsed, leaving a minority government in place until the elections scheduled for February 2025. In this uncertain environment, the BCE is watching several key indicators, and while some show improvements, caution remains. Inflation in Europe is approaching the 2% target, offering a reason for optimism. A moderate 25-point base rate cut seems to be the preferred scenario. Many analysts anticipate this choice, considering it a logical decision. However, internal discussions have mentioned a more aggressive 50-point base rate cut, which was ultimately ruled out due to revised inflation forecasts. The December meeting of the BCE will be crucial for the future of the European economy. If a rate cut is expected, the extent of this measure will depend on the complex balance between economic and political pressures on the eurozone.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 09, 2024 08:11 AM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/actualite-bourse/Quelle-position-va-prendre-la-BCE-pour-la-suite-des-evenements--48548533/)\n\n",

Over the last decade, inflation in the Eurozone has typically stayed close to the European Central Bank's target of close to but below 2%.

The frequency with which inflation exceeds 2.4% specifically in recent years can help establish a base rate. Since the Eurozone crisis, inflation exceeded this level notably during the COVID-19 pandemic when inflation reached higher levels due to supply chain challenges.
