The launch will take place from the Bowen Space Centre in Queensland, Australia, and will carry a small satellite model into orbit. Gilmour Space received a license from the Australian Space Agency to launch its new rocket in November last year, and was initially planning to launch it in early December, but delayed the operation until this year to conduct further inspections and safety checks on the rocket's components and equipment. The Eris rocket is a lightweight, three-stage rocket that can carry payloads of up to 215 kg into Earth's orbit. Gilmour Space has secured funding of $89.1 million to develop and launch this type of rocket into space.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 11:17 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/space/1650391-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%84-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B6%D8%A7%D8%A1/)\n\n**The 1st Australian rocket to launch from Australian soil could reach orbit next month**\nGilmour Space, an Australian company, has announced a launch window of no earlier than March 15 for its first-ever orbital launch attempt from its Bowen Orbital Spaceport in Queensland. The Eris rocket, designed and built by Gilmour Space, aims to reach a 310-mile-altitude sun-synchronous orbit and deliver a payload of up to 474 pounds. According to Adam Gilmour, co-founder and CEO, 'This will be the first attempt of an Australian rocket to reach orbit from Australian soil.' Gilmour noted that safety is the top priority and that the company may face hurdles, but emphasized that every second of flight will deliver valuable data to improve the rocket's reliability and performance for future launches. 'Whether we make it off the pad, reach max Q, or get all the way to space, what's important is that every second of flight will deliver valuable data,' he said. Gilmour Space has over 200 employees and is backed by private investors, aiming to lower the cost of access to space.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 05:01 PM\nSource:[Space.com](https://www.space.com/gilmour-space-eris-rocket-1st-orbital-launch-australian-soil)\n\n**Gilmour Space to Launch First Eris Rocket in Mid-March**\nAustralian company Gilmour Space is set to launch its first rocket, Eris, in mid-March.

The Korean Aerospace Agency (KASA) has announced plans to accelerate the development of a reusable rocket, which could potentially replace the planned single-use system of the next generation. This decision is motivated by changes in the international space industry and the desire to reduce launch costs. KASA's initial plan was to create a new single-use rocket by 2032, capable of surpassing the current 'Nuri' (KSLV-II) in power and technological level. However, now, just a year after the plan was approved and a contractor was chosen, the vector may change. According to KASA's head, Yun Yong Bin, the strategy change is due to the need to consider global experience, particularly the success of SpaceX. 'The fact is that SpaceX, with its economical reusable rockets Falcon 9, controls 80% of the commercial launch market, providing half of all global launches. If we continue to focus only on single-use systems, we will never be able to compete on a global level,' he said. South Korea plans to develop a reusable rocket engine prototype by 2028, conduct the first tests, and conduct a test flight with a demonstration of reusability by 2032. A full transition to reusable launch technology is planned for 2035. The main reason for the transition to reusable systems is the cost of launches. South Korea aims to actively compete on the international market for commercial launches, planning to earn significant money. According to KASA, using modern single-use rockets will not allow for a reduction in costs to a competitive level. In the case of success, the new strategy, the cost of sending cargo to a low Earth orbit (LEO) may be reduced to $1000 per 1 kg, and the number of annual launches in South Korea will increase to 20 by 2035. 'This step is also critical for the private sector, which will use our technologies. Companies entering the commercial launch market will not be able to compete if the basic cost remains high,' emphasized Yun Yong Bin. He believes that the chosen course will support the key private Korean contractor - Hanwha Aerospace, which received a contract in 2023 to develop new rockets. Despite the rather sharp turn in the approach, South Korea's plans to launch its own lunar mission in 2032 remain in place, but now KASA plans to use a transitional scheme. Initially, the rocket will work in 'single-use mode' (used only for one launch), but then, after modifications, it will begin to perform missions to a low Earth orbit in a reusable mode. Some experts are concerned that the strategy change may slow down the lunar program, especially in the face of possible funding cuts for a similar American project 'Artemis'. However, KASA's head is confident in the opposite: 'The US will not give up on landing on the Moon, as it is a key element in the Mars flight strategy. This means that South Korea must continue to move in this direction.' In addition to technological challenges, KASA has already faced several internal problems. One of them is a dispute over intellectual property between the Korean Institute of Aerospace Research (KARI) and Hanwha Aerospace. According to Yun Yong Bin, the agency is acting as a mediator in the negotiations and hopes for a quick resolution of the conflict. Also, there is uncertainty regarding the future of the 'Nuri' rocket. While KASA is conducting an analysis of possible scenarios, a special working group has been created to study options for continuing the program. According to the announced plans, by the end of 2025, KASA will conduct a detailed analysis of the economic and technological feasibility of changing the strategy. In the discussion, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, and leading South Korean aerospace institutes and companies will participate. If KASA successfully implements the program of reusable carriers, South Korea hopes to enter the ranks of world leaders in the space industry and compete with giants such as the US, Russia, China, and Europe.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/54263587-yuzhnaya-koreya-radikalno-peresmotrit-svoyu-strategiyu-v-oblasti-raketostroeniya/)\n\n**Gilmour Space Sets March 15 Launch Window for Eris Orbital Rocket**\nGilmour Space Technologies has confirmed that its first orbital rocket, Eris, is set for launch no earlier than March 15, marking Australia's first domestically designed and built rocket attempting to reach orbit.

The satellite, part of the ESA's Earth Explorer program, aims to measure forest biomass and evaluate terrestrial carbon stocks and flows from an orbit of 666 km. The satellite will feature the first synthetic aperture radar in P-band installed on a spacecraft, allowing for precise mapping of tropical, temperate, and boreal forests. According to Alain Faur\u00e9, head of space systems at Airbus Defence and Space, 'the launch of this emblematic mission is a significant milestone after years of hard work and dedication from all our teams. The innovative technology of the satellite will allow climatologists to evaluate with precision the reserves and flows of carbon from space and to better understand the role that forests play in regulating the climate.' The satellite will undergo launch and operational phases in orbit, while an independent team manages the delivery of the terrestrial calibration transponder located in New Norcia, Australia. The mission, which defines itself as the ESA's flagship for forest biomass analysis, will allow climate experts to obtain precise evaluations of carbon stocks and flows, contributing to the understanding of the role that forests play in regulating the climate.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 10:34 AM\nSource:[aviacionline.com](https://www.aviacionline.com/satelito-construido-por-airbus-para-medicion-de-bosques-es-enviado-a-guayana-francesa)\n\n**Gilmour Space Technologies to Launch First Orbital Rocket in March**\nGilmour Space Technologies, a space technology company based in Queensland, Australia, has announced that its first orbital rocket, Eris, will be launched in March. The company had initially planned to launch the rocket in May 2024, but it received final airspace approval only in December last year. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Adam Gilmour, co-founder of Gilmour Space Technologies, said that a successful launch would be a historic moment for Australia. 'Eris' launch will prove Australia's sovereign space capability, which has never been seen before,' he said. However, he noted that the launch may be delayed due to technical or environmental reasons, such as the strengthening tropical cyclone Alfred. 'We think the impact on our launch site will only be strong winds, which will cause us to pause or delay the launch,' Gilmour said. The company hopes that the rocket will enter orbit on its first launch, which would be 'very fortunate.' 'Success means different things to different people, but lighting the fuse and launching will be a huge achievement,' he said. The Eris rocket will be an uncrewed rocket, but it will carry a jar of Australian 'Vegemite' on board. 'We hope that the Vegemite jar will not be damaged in this first attempt,' he said. The launch site is located at Abbot Point, near the coastal community of Bowen, which was chosen due to its proximity to the equator and low population density. The Bowen Chamber of Commerce is expecting the launch to bring 'huge momentum' to local businesses. 'This is a very exciting step for Bowen, the community, and the region, as it's significant to us,' said Bruce Hedditch, chairman of the chamber. 'It will have a huge impact on North Queensland.'

    "summary": "After reviewing the initial and revised analyses of various experts on whether Gilmour Space Technologies will launch a rocket before April 1, 2025, the consensus shows an increase in probability from phase 1 to phase 2. Initially, experts were cautious due to regulatory and technical challenges, with probabilities ranging from 5% to 75%. However, subsequent news confirming final regulatory approvals and the setting of a specific launch window starting March 15 led experts to revise their probabilities upwards. Despite acknowledging potential issues like Tropical Cyclone Alfred, the revised probabilities are generally higher, with most experts landing around 30% to 80% likelihood, reflecting improved confidence in Gilmour's readiness and commitment to launch within the given timeframe.",
