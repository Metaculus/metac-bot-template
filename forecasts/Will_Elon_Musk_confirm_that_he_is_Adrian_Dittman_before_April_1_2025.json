Despite not meeting Wall Street's financial expectations, the company's shares rose 4.7% due to cost-cutting measures and new product timelines. CEO Elon Musk revealed plans to test a fully autonomous car service in Austin, Texas, using the current electric vehicle platform.

The announcement comes ahead of the release of an earnings report, which will share Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings in 2024. The report will also show that Tesla's delivery fell thousands short of Wall Street expectations. Musk shared footage of Tesla's electric cars driving without human supervision, indicating, navigating around other cars, and directing themselves from the factory to their designated loading dock lanes. Tesla plans to manufacture a dedicated Robotaxi vehicle, the Cybercab, in 2026, and use its self-driving software to make millions of existing vehicles autonomous. Ahead of the release of the earnings report, the Tesla stock slightly dropped, but analysts believe that Tesla will benefit from Musk's ties to the Trump administration, which could help pave the way for some of the company's future projects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 02:13 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/elon-musk-announces-tesla-milestone-ahead-earnings-report-2022683)\n\n**Trump and Musk say SpaceX will 'go get' NASA astronauts stuck in space**\nFormer US President Donald Trump has asked Elon Musk and SpaceX to 'go get' NASA astronauts Sunita 'Suni' Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore who have been stuck on the International Space Station (ISS) since June 2024. Musk confirmed that SpaceX would bring the astronauts home 'as soon as possible.' However, NASA had already scheduled their return for late March or possibly April, and the necessity of Trump's personal involvement in the mission is unclear. Williams and Wilmore were originally supposed to return on Boeing's Starliner capsule, but technical issues forced NASA to leave them on the ISS until SpaceX's next crew-rotation mission. Musk, who has become a key figure in Trump's re-election campaign, expressed frustration with NASA in the past, calling the Artemis program 'extremely inefficient.' Despite Trump's assertion that the astronauts were 'abandoned,' NASA has consistently maintained that Wilmore and Williams are not stranded and are in good health.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 09:44 AM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/iss-nasa-donald-trump-elon-musk-suni-williams-2022617)\n\n**Musk assures SpaceX will bring back astronauts, NASA sees no urgency**\nElon Musk announced that SpaceX is ready to bring back two NASA astronauts, Barry 'Butch' Wilmore and Sunita Williams, who have been stranded on the ISS due to Boeing's Starliner issues. Musk stated that the Biden administration had 'left them there too long,' sparking a political debate. NASA clarified that the astronauts were never in danger and extended their stay for safety and crew rotation reasons. The return is scheduled for March 2025 alongside the Crew 9 mission, but NASA argues that an early return could disrupt ISS operations and delay Crew 10's arrival. Musk's comments have been met with skepticism by NASA, who insists that the return remains on track with no immediate changes needed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 08:57 AM\nSource:[NORTHEAST NOW](https://nenow.in/world/musk-assures-spacex-will-bring-back-astronauts-nasa-sees-no-urgency.html)\n\n**Trump Seeks Elon Musk's Aid In Bringing Sunita Williams Back From Space; Slams Biden Admin Over 'Abandoning' Her**\nUS President Donald Trump has directed Elon Musk's SpaceX to bring back NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore from the International Space Station (ISS) after they were stranded since June 2024. Trump accused the previous Joe Biden administration of 'abandoning' them. NASA had announced that the astronauts would return to Earth in February 2025, but their mission was extended until the end of March or April due to a delay in launching their replacements. Trump tweeted, 'I have just asked Elon Musk and SpaceX to 'go get' the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration.' Musk confirmed that SpaceX would bring the astronauts home as soon as possible, stating, 'We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.' The astronauts' return was initially scheduled for February 2025, but technical glitches, including helium leaks and thruster malfunctions, have caused delays. Boeing's Starliner capsule, which was initially supposed to bring the astronauts back, is not yet fully operational, leading NASA to reconsider its plans.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 08:01 AM\nSource:[outlookindia.com](https://www.outlookindia.com/international/us/trump-seeks-elon-musks-aid-in-bringing-sunita-williams-back-from-space-slams-biden-admin-over-abandoning-her)\n\n**Sunita Williams, Butch Wilmore to return home soon?

US President Donald Trump asked Elon Musk's company to bring them home after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft suffered multiple technical failures. Musk confirmed the request, saying, 'The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible. We will do so.' Despite NASA's insistence that the astronauts are not stranded, they will return aboard SpaceX's Crew-9 capsule, with original Crew-9 astronauts Zena Cardman and Stephanie Wilson giving up their seats. This change has also delayed NASA's next mission, SpaceX Crew-10, which is now expected to launch in late March 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 04:07 AM\nSource:[Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India](https://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-nasa-sunita-williams-butch-wilmore-to-return-home-soon-elon-musk-gives-big-update-says-donald-trump-asked-spacex-to-3129490)\n\n**IT predictions: 5 things that won't change in 2025**\nAccording to predictions, several trends in IT will remain unchanged in 2025.

However, the photo has been online since at least November 8, 2023, when it appeared on the Austrian news website Heute. The vandalism incident, which damaged 19 cars, including several non-Tesla vehicles, occurred in Vienna's Wilhelm-Exner-Gasse. According to Heute, a 'reader reporter' took the photo, which showed five vandalized cars, including the Tesla. As Heute reported, local police confirmed 19 cars were damaged in the incident.

The pair were initially suspended for 30 days for writing an article about their discovery, but had their suspension shortened to 7 days after appealing. However, they were recently asked to delete more posts about the matter, including some that didn't even mention Dittmann's name. Crimew argued that X's moderation is 'childish' and that the platform is using 'unevenly applied rules' to censor them. Despite the crackdown, other outlets that covered the story have not been suspended. Fae and Sweet remain suspended, but crimew had their account reinstated after deleting the posts flagged by X.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 03:24 PM\nSource:[upstract.com](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/elon-musk-adrian-dittman-journalists/?ref=upstract.com)\n\n**The Mystery of Adrian Dittmann: Is He Really Elon Musk?**\nA theory has been circulating online that Adrian Dittmann, a user on the social media platform X, is actually Elon Musk. However, according to two articles in Rolling Stone and The Spectator, Dittmann is actually a 20-year-old German man living in Oceania who is intentionally creating confusion to attract traffic to his account and earn money through X's premium subscription. Dittmann has been posting flattering comments about Elon Musk, such as 'X is the best social media platform of all time' and 'You're an incredible father, Elon, your kids are lucky to have you.' Some users have accused Dittmann of being Musk himself, but others have pointed out that Musk has a history of using pseudonyms and self-aggrandizing language. Musk has even admitted to using fake accounts in the past, and has a known alias 'cyb3rgam3r420' for discussing video games.

According to Sweet, Dittmann is a German living in Fiji, the son of a software entrepreneur who has launched several businesses, including a forestry venture and a marina. Sweet's investigation found that Dittmann's company entered the Musk Foundation's $100 million Xprize Carbon Removal contest in July 2021, the same month the Dittmann X account was created. X is blocking anyone from sharing Sweet's story and suspended her account for 30 days. Sweet pointed out that the accents and writing styles of Dittmann and Musk are different, and that Dittmann's defense of Musk on X and 4chan is likely due to being a super fan. Musk has also been caught using alt accounts before, and Sweet's investigation suggests that Dittmann is not a fake account created by Musk, but rather a fan who sounds similar to him. 'I am Adrian Dittmann,' Musk replied to Sweet's post on X, seemingly playing along with the story. 'It's time the world knew,' he said. However, an anonymous source within X told The Verge that the screenshot of the admin panel shared by Dittmann on 4chan is fabricated. 'We can't complete this request because this link has been identified by X or our partners as being potentially harmful,' X says when trying to share Sweet's story. 'It is improbable that they are different people, but it is not impossible,' said UC Berkeley professor Hany Farid, who analyzed the voices of Dittmann and Musk. 'I performed this analysis by comparing each of 500 distinct voices in a dataset we created to the closest match in the same dataset,' Farid said. 'With only 500 people in our dataset, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions across a larger population, but based on this analysis, I can say that only about 0.5% of people have a voice doppelganger as similar as Musk and Dittman.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-is-blocking-links-to-a-journalists-investigation-into-his-doppelganger-2000546300)\n\n**X Locks Out Reporter and Suppresses Spectator Article on Owner Elon Musk Sock Puppet Rumor**\nJournalist Jacqueline Sweet's article for The Spectator World confirming that Elon Musk is not using a sock puppet account under the name Adrian Dittman has been suppressed by X.

However, after the article was published, Musk responded by claiming to be Dittman, and Sweet's X account was limited for 30 days for 'doxxing.' A warning also appears on X when users attempt to click a link to the article, stating that it 'may be unsafe' due to 'violent or misleading content.'

The investigation cross-referenced years of social media activity and documents, and found that Dittmann's online footprint remains almost entirely confined to his social media posts. Dittmann had claimed to reside in 'Oceania' and had participated in a Musk Foundation carbon removal contest, which The Spectator found to be true.

Some reports suggested that Dittmann was an elaborate hoax played by Musk to fool everyone. The account confirmed that it participated in the carbon removal contest in April 2023 and shared a screenshot showing admin access to X, further fueling speculation that it was Musk.

Dittman was invited on a Fortnite stream by YouTuber/Streamer ConnorEatsPants, where he was grilled under the assumption that he was Musk. The stream highlighted commonalities between Dittman and Musk, but also showed that Dittman is not Musk, as he periodically denied it and showed signs of being a superfan. According to the report, Dittman's actions, such as sharing a screenshot on 4chan with admin access at Twitter, were misinterpreted as evidence of him being Musk. In reality, Dittman is just a fan who is not very good at Fortnite, as ConnorEatsPants joked during the stream, saying 'This guy is not Elon, he's just a dude who loves him and is not very good at Fortnite.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 07:05 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/01/04/adrian-dittman-grilled-in-wild-fortnite-stream-is-likely-not-elons-alter-ego/)\n\n**Why Do So Many People Believe Adrian Dittmann Is Elon Musk?**\nThe conspiracy theory that Elon Musk is behind the @AdrianDittmann account on X has been circulating since 2023. Despite the lack of concrete evidence, many users believe that Dittmann is Musk's pseudonymous identity, created to sing his own praises. However, misinformation researcher E. Rosalie Li has identified several factors that suggest Dittmann is not Musk, including differences in posting behavior and voice similarity. A digital forensic analysis by The Spectator also suggests that Dittmann is a real person, not Musk. The real Dittmann is reportedly a German man in his twenties living in Oceania, who has been involved in various business ventures, including a forestry venture and a marina and yachting facility.

Dittman posted screenshots on 4chan that seemingly revealed he has access to administrator privileges on X, although the authenticity of the image has been disputed. The image was part of a rambling defense of Musk's stewardship of X, including the claim that 'Elon is a father who gets lots of sex.' Earlier allegations that Musk and Dittman are one and the same include similarities in their voices and laughs, and Dittman referring to Musk in the first person. However, a source at X claims that the image was faked, and it's unclear whether Dittman posted it or not. Musk has previously admitted to using sockpuppet accounts, including one pretending to be a three-year-old child. The allegations are impossible to prove or disprove, and may continue to drag on unless Musk is forced to reveal the truth in a lawsuit deposition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 11:23 PM\nSource:[pcgamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/elon-is-a-father-who-gets-lots-of-sex-somehow-leads-to-renewed-claims-that-elon-musk-superfan-adrian-dittman-is-actually-musk-himself/)\n\n**\u2018More proof\u2019: Internet sleuths think they\u2019ve revealed Elon Musk\u2019s alternative account**\nInternet sleuths believe they have found evidence that Adrian Dittmann, an X (formerly Twitter) account with 171,000 followers, is actually Elon Musk's burner account.

Dittmann has vigorously defended Musk's stance on immigration policy and has been accused of being a 'fake persona created by @elonmusk.' However, some observers remain unconvinced, including political commentator Brian Krassenstein, who claims to have spoken with both Musk and Dittmann separately and dismisses the theory as conspiracy thinking.

Musk has personally addressed these claims, sharing a meme referring to the conspiracy theorists as 'subtards' and laughing off the speculation.

Charles Johnson claims to have uncovered 'proof' that Dittman is Musk, citing similarities in their voices and a video that he believes confirms Musk's involvement. However, others have disputed this claim, saying that Dittman's voice tone and cadence are not similar to Musk's, and that Musk would not operate under a fake account speaking in the third person. Johnson wrote, 'I recently attended a Twitter Space where I exposed Elon Musk\u2019s alt account and Elon Musk as a fraud to his face. Take a listen. It was pretty great.'
