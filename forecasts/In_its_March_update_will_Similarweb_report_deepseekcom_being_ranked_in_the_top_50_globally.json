According to Guo, Taiwan has a strong foundation in semiconductor manufacturing and has developed AI high-efficiency chips with unique advantages and bargaining power. Taiwan's manufacturers believe that the long-term demand for AI will remain strong, and the cost of tariffs will be passed on to American companies. The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing and American IC design are mutually beneficial and complementary. If the US imposes tariffs on Taiwan's semiconductors, the cost will be transferred to the product prices, and American companies may not benefit. To address the issue, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' deputy minister, Jiang Wen-ru, and the Industrial Development Bureau's deputy director, Chen Pei-li, have communicated with US officials. The US has imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has stated that it will assist Taiwanese companies in adjusting their production lines and layouts in Mexico. Meanwhile, the rise of DeepSeek has surprised the world, and its true nature remains a mystery. Guo Tai-hui said that this is beneficial to Taiwan, and if DeepSeek can achieve similar effects to ChatGPT through software alone, Taiwan may be able to learn from it. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has tasked its technology department with analyzing DeepSeek's open-source code to confirm whether it is true. If so, Taiwan will take advantage of its strengths and expand AI applications in various industries. Taiwan aims to become a top AI nation and has strengthened its AI software applications. The Ministry of Economic Affairs is also planning to attract digital immigrants to Taiwan and has discussed tax incentives with the Ministry of Finance. Taiwan has been rapidly expanding its computing power, with a current capacity of 103 PF (every second trillion floating-point operations). The global computing power ranking has Taiwan at 11th place, with the US at 1st place (6475 PF), Japan at 2nd place (940 PF), and Italy at 3rd place (849 PF). Taiwan's public and private sectors have collaborated on large-scale computing power construction projects, with a total capacity of 300 PF expected this year, 1000 PF in 2028, and 1200 PF in 2029. Taiwan has also been continuously developing AI chips, with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the National Science Council cooperating to establish the 'Taiwan Artificial Intelligence Chip Alliance' in 2019. One of the key focuses is the development of 'half-universal AI chips,' which can satisfy multiple functions with a single chip. For example, AI image recognition chips can simultaneously handle dynamic and static image recognition. The technology department stated that developing high-efficiency and low-power AI chips is necessary, and the Industrial Technology Research Institute has developed a magnetic memory (MRAM) technology that can be miniaturized to advanced processes, with a performance advantage of 40% over Korean manufacturers. This technology can be used for 'memory-based computing' and has been adopted by Taiwan's leading manufacturers.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831\u96fb\u5b50\u5831](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/paper/1692109)\n\n**Who is the Biggest Loser with WeChat's Integration of DeepSeek?**\nThe integration of DeepSeek into WeChat has caused a stir, with many analysts predicting that Baidu will be the biggest loser. According to DeepSeek, Baidu's search market share has been declining, from 86.82% in 2021 to 60% in 2024, while platforms like WeChat and Xiaohongshu are gaining traction with AI-powered search. DeepSeek believes that WeChat's integration with its model will make it easier for users to get accurate answers within the ecosystem, further reducing Baidu's dependence on traditional search. Additionally, WeChat's vast content library, combined with DeepSeek's semantic understanding and personalized recommendation capabilities, will activate long-tail content and enable 'search as a service' (e.g., direct calls to mini-programs). Baidu lacks a similar content ecosystem and is unlikely to compete. 'This wave means one thing: stationing oneself,' said an analyst. 'If the global path chosen by WeChat, with over 10 billion users, is to seal the deal, then it's just a matter of waiting for the feast.' Despite Baidu's announcement that its Wenxin Big Model will be available for free from April 1, it may be too little, too late. WeChat's low-cost integration with DeepSeek has enabled a technological leap, while Baidu is likely to fall behind in data integration and user experience. DeepSeek believes that Baidu faces a triple threat of technology, ecosystem, and user habit disruption, and may lose competitiveness in the AI-driven search era unless it can quickly adapt.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 01:54 PM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u7f51](http://tech.hexun.com/2025-02-16/217357624.html)\n\n**Who is the biggest loser after WeChat integrates DeepSeek? DeepSeek says it's Baidu!**\nThe integration of DeepSeek into WeChat has caused a stir in the industry, with some analysts predicting that it will lead to a significant shift in the search landscape. According to DeepSeek, Baidu is the biggest loser in this scenario, as WeChat's integration of DeepSeek will make it easier for users to get accurate answers within the WeChat ecosystem, reducing their reliance on traditional search engines like Baidu. DeepSeek believes that Baidu's search market share has been declining, from 86.82% in 2021 to 60% in 2024, while platforms like WeChat and Xiaohongshu are gaining traction with AI-powered search. WeChat's integration of DeepSeek will also enable users to access high-quality content within the platform, further eroding Baidu's dominance. 'WeChat's move means 'stationing oneself at the side', ' said an analyst. 'If the global ten billion users of WeChat choose this path, it's like nailing down the coffin lid and waiting for the feast.' DeepSeek also believes that Baidu's Wenxin Big Model, which was announced to be free from April 1, may be too little, too late. WeChat's low-cost integration of DeepSeek will give it a significant technological advantage, while Baidu will struggle to keep up with data integration and user experience. 'Baidu faces multiple challenges from technology, ecosystem, and user habits, and if it cannot quickly transform, it may lose its competitiveness in the AI-driven search new era,' said DeepSeek.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/shenji/2025-02-16/doc-ineksnvc8990307.shtml)\n\n**US Leads AI Development, but China's Deepseek Challenges Sustainability**\nThe United States currently leads the development of artificial intelligence (AI), according to the University of Stanford's ranking. The US sector has received eight times more private capital than China in 2023, and has created nearly seven out of every ten large language models. The US also designs and produces the most powerful microchips, the engines that drive technology, and has the greatest capacity for data storage, the raw material of AI. US companies, such as OpenAI, Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, dominate the sector. According to Judith Arnal, a researcher at the Instituto Elcano, 'the US model is characterized by a certain techno-optimism, which allows the free market to operate without a strict regulatory framework.' However, the emergence of the Chinese company Deepseek has challenged the sustainability of the US model, as it has achieved similar performance to its US competitors at a lower cost, energy consumption, and computational power. Additionally, the removal of regulatory frameworks by Donald Trump could undermine confidence in US AI models.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 05:13 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/internacional/eeuu-ue-china-control-ia-sh/)\n\n**What Chinese media and experts are saying on AI disruptor DeepSeek - The Sunday Guardian Live**\nChinese AI startup DeepSeek has made a significant impact in the tech sector with its 'low-cost + open-source' model, causing a $1 trillion decline in U.S. tech companies' market value.

DeepSeek's models are gaining attention for their efficient performance at low costs and energy use. The company's latest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, showed similar performance to that of Microsoft-backed OpenAI's reasoning models and Meta Platforms' META Llama models on leading benchmarks. According to the author, 'We expect U.S. tech giants to continue their spending momentum as models become more complex and deployment time reduces drastically.' The author believes that Amphenol, Broadcom, and NVIDIA are well-positioned to benefit from the increasing deployment of AI and Generative AI (GenAI) technology. Amphenol's diversified business model lowers the volatility of individual end markets and geographies, while Broadcom is benefiting from strong demand for its networking products and custom AI accelerators. NVIDIA is expected to continue benefiting from accelerating usage of its GPUs, including Hopper and Ampere architectures.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/3-top-ranked-semiconductor-stocks-buy-despite-deepseek-disruption)\n\n**China\u2019s DeepSeek surpasses ChatGPT in US app downloads**\nChina's homegrown AI model, DeepSeek, has surpassed ChatGPT in US app downloads and secured the top spot in China's free app rankings.
