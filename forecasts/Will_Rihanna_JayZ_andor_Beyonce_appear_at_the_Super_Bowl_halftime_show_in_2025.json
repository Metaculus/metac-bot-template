The show included flames, fireworks, lights, a large stage with many dancers, smoke, and a grand choreography, leaving the audience without power for over half an hour. Rihanna, pregnant with her second child, performed at the 2023 Super Bowl halftime show, starting with a presentation that featured her biggest hits, including 'Bitch Better Have My Money', 'Where Have You Been', 'Rude Boy', and 'Work'.

The show is expected to start around 12pm AEDT on Monday, February 10, and will last around 13 minutes. Lamar's performance has been surrounded by controversy, with local right-wing politicians declaring the show must be 'family-friendly' due to past performances by Rihanna and concerns about Lamar's feud with Drake, which is central to his recent album 'Not Like Us'. Drake has launched a lawsuit against Lamar for 'falsely accusing him of being a sex offender' and is also suing his own record label. Lamar has previously performed at the Super Bowl in 2022 as a guest in the halftime show headlined by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. 'We realise that these past vulgar performances may have been acceptable to the residents of those states where those Super Bowls were held but, in Louisiana, these lewd acts are inappropriate for viewing by children, objectify women, and are simply NOT welcomed by the majority of Louisiana parents,' said local right-wing politicians. Lamar's setlist is expected to include songs from his recent album, as well as possible surprise guests, including Lil Wayne, Baby Keem, Future, Metro Boomin, Jay Rock, Doechii, and Travis Scott.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 11:51 AM\nSource:[Fox Sports](https://www.foxsports.com.au/nfl/superbowl/super-bowl-2025-halftime-show-kendrick-lamar-list-of-songs-to-be-performed-drake-controversy-start-time-aedt-when-is-the-super-bowl-lix-half-time-show/news-story/ac460d829f5aae0a040f2da59c58a62d)\n\n**Louisiana lawmakers demand 'family-friendly' halftime shows ahead of Super Bowl 2025, slam Rihanna, J.

They slammed previous performances from Rihanna and Jennifer Lopez as 'lewd' and 'offensive', citing their 'vulgar' acts as examples of what they consider unacceptable for children. The legislators argue that taxpayers should have a say in the event since the state government contributes money to it. They have called out Rihanna's performance for 'groping herself' and Lopez's for 'wearing little clothing and being groped by dancers on stage.' The letter also requests that future contracts for the halftime event ensure that performers adhere to Louisiana's community decency standards.

The presentation, streamed exclusively on Netflix on December 25, 2024, has been criticized for its supposed similarities in design and execution with Rihanna's show. Beyonc\u00e9's performance, which took place at the NRG Stadium in Houston, included songs from her album 'Cowboy Carter' and featured special guests like Post Malone, Shaboozey, and her 12-year-old daughter Blue Ivy.

Others questioned the originality of Beyonc\u00e9's concept, suggesting that the show was directly inspired by Rihanna's. Despite the criticism, some users defended Beyonc\u00e9, arguing that her talent is superior to Rihanna's and that there's no room for comparison.

Beyonc\u00e9 has been a popular fixture for the NFL, performing at the 2013 Super Bowl and appearing as a guest star alongside Bruno Mars and Coldplay three years later.
