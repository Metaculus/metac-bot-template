    "question": "Will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum, before April 6, 2025?",

In November 2008, 75% of Greenlanders [voted for](https://visitgreenland.com/articles/greenlands-modern-path-to-independence/) the Self-Government Act, which greatly expanded the island's autonomy.

Lekkegaard acknowledged that Greenland's future ultimately lies in the hands of the Greenlandic people, but argued that it's time for 'new thinking'. 'We live in a world where, no matter how independent you want to be, you need to be a member of alliances,' he said. 'And in my opinion, the EU is the best alliance you can join. This applies to Denmark, this applies to Greenland.' Lekkegaard believes that being part of the EU would provide Greenland with protection. Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, voted to leave the European Communities, a precursor to the EU, in a referendum in 1982 and officially left the bloc in 1985. However, most of its approximately 60,000 citizens are Danish and therefore remain EU citizens. 'It's clear that the situation has changed dramatically since 1985,' Lekkegaard said. Additionally, Greenland has a strong movement for independence, with Prime Minister Mute Egede calling for the island's separation from Denmark. 'We don't want to be Danes. We don't want to be Americans. We want to be Greenlanders,' he said in an interview earlier this month. It's worth noting that Donald Trump has stated that control over Greenland is 'absolutely necessary' for the United States, and that the US does not rule out the possibility of using force to annex the island.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 10:49 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/svit/grenlandiyu-prizvali-vstupit-es-chtoby-zaschititsya-ot-trampa-2755332.html)\n\n**Greenland's Autonomy and Independence: A New Era in the Relationship with Denmark**\nThe recent visit of Donald Trump's private plane to the Nuuk airport in Greenland has sparked a diplomatic crisis between the US and Denmark. Trump has claimed that Greenland is vital for US security and that Denmark should hand over control of the island to the US. The Greenlandic government has rejected this proposal, with 85% of the population opposing a merger with the US. The Danish government has announced an increase in defense spending for its Arctic territory and is seeking support from European capitals. However, the crisis has also led to a re-evaluation of the relationship between Denmark and Greenland, with the Greenlandic government gaining more autonomy and influence on the international stage. The Danish government has also agreed to suspend the controversial 'FKU' tests, which have been a source of tension between the two countries. The tests, which evaluate a parent's ability to care for their children, have been criticized for being culturally insensitive and have led to the removal of many children from their families. The Greenlandic government has long been seeking to abolish the tests, and the crisis has given them a newfound sense of confidence and autonomy. 'We are not Danish, but we do not want to be American either,' said Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede. 'We want to be independent and make our own decisions.' The crisis has also highlighted the cultural differences between Denmark and Greenland, with many Greenlanders feeling that they are treated as second-class citizens by the Danish government. 'We are two different countries, and the ultimate goal is independence,' said Najannguac Dalgard Christensen, a Greenlandic politician. 'The reality is that we are two countries with different cultures and values, and it's time for us to take control of our own destiny.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 07:52 PM\nSource:[Le Figaro.fr](https://www.lefigaro.fr/international/comment-la-convoitise-de-donald-trump-bouscule-le-jeu-entre-le-groenland-et-le-danemark-20250129)\n\n**85% of Greenland Residents Oppose Becoming Part of the United States**\nA recent survey conducted by two Danish media outlets and a polling organization, Verian, found that 85% of residents on Greenland do not want to become part of the United States. The survey was conducted after US President Trump threatened to buy Greenland, and it is the first time a survey has been conducted on the topic. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen recently spoke with Trump over the phone, emphasizing that the future of Greenland should be decided by the people of Greenland themselves. Frederiksen has also been visiting European countries to seek support. In a recent interview, she stated that 'we must respect each other's territory and sovereignty, which is an important element of the international community.' The survey found that 85% of respondents were against leaving the Danish kingdom and joining the US, while 6% were in favor, and 9% were undecided. Kasper Moller Hansen, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, stated that the survey clearly shows that the people of Greenland do not want to become Americans. The issue of independence has been a topic of debate on Greenland for years, but the island's economic development is heavily reliant on funding from the Danish government. The issue is expected to be a major topic in the local elections in April.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 06:52 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/cn/%E6%AC%A7%E6%B4%B2/20250129-%E6%A0%BC%E9%99%B5%E5%85%B0%E5%B2%9B%E6%9C%80%E6%96%B0%E6%B0%91%E8%B0%83-85-%E7%9A%84%E5%B1%85%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%8D%E6%83%B3%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA)\n\n**Greenland: A Majority of Citizens Oppose Joining the United States**\nA recent survey conducted by Verian for the Danish newspaper Berlingske and the Greenlandic newspaper Sermitsiaq found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to become part of the United States, while only 6% are in favor and 9% are undecided. The survey was conducted in January 2025 and involved 497 citizens aged 18 and over. Greenland's Prime Minister, Aaja Chemnitz, stated, 'We don't want to be Danes. We want to have good relations with the Danes, but we want to find a different way that allows us to be Greenlanders.' The Greenlandic government is seeking sovereignty and independence, and the question of independence will be at the heart of the upcoming local elections. 'Trump has put Greenland on the political agenda, including for the Danes and the Danish parliament, which means that Denmark is now aware that it must do something,' said Kasper Moller Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Copenhagen. The Danish government has launched several initiatives to show its involvement, including a 2 billion euro package to strengthen security in the Arctic and a plan of action against racism towards Greenlanders in Denmark. 'The Trump's intentions are an opportunity for us, not necessarily in terms of independence, but in terms of many other small steps in the ongoing negotiations between Denmark and Greenland,' Hansen added.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[20minutes.fr](https://www.20minutes.fr/monde/etats-unis/4136160-20250129-groenland-ecrasante-majorite-habitants-veulent-appartenir-etats-unis)\n\n**Siumut Calls for Action on Greenland's Path to Independence**\nThe Greenlandic government party Siumut is calling for action on the country's path to independence. According to Doris J. Jensen, the party's political leader, it is time to activate paragraph 21 of the Home Rule Act, which leads to Greenland's independence. Jensen says, 'We are in a time where Greenland's strategic importance is growing, and it is crucial that we act now. If we continue to talk and wait, we risk being negotiated over, and we may miss the opportunities that are currently open to us.' Vivian Motzfeldt, the Minister for Independence and Foreign Affairs, disagrees, saying that they should wait for the commission's report, which is due in two years. However, Jensen emphasizes that 'we cannot wait for the perfect timing, the world is not waiting for us. It is our responsibility to utilize the open doors that exist now and begin negotiations with both Denmark and international actors.' \nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 02:24 PM\nSource:[dr.dk](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/politik/internt-opgoer-breder-sig-i-groenlandsk-regeringsparti-profil-vil-have-fart-paa)\n\n**Danes may lose Greenland despite EU support**\nDanes may lose Greenland despite EU support. The Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, is facing pressure from Donald Trump, who has expressed his desire to make Greenland a US protectorate. Frederiksen has visited Paris and Berlin to secure support from Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz, but their promises may not be enough. The upcoming elections in Greenland, scheduled for April 2025, will decide whether the territory will remain under Danish rule or become an American protectorate. The US has promised Greenlanders a US passport and massive subsidies, which could sway public opinion. The EU has offered to send military reinforcements to defend Greenland, but this may not be enough to deter the US. The situation is complex, and the EU's response may not be unanimous. Some EU leaders, like Viktor Orban, may prioritize their own interests over defending Greenland. The idea of making Greenland a condominium between the US and the EU is also being discussed in Washington. The Danish government may have no choice but to accept this situation, and the Greenlandic parliament is preparing a referendum on independence. 'It is a matter of protecting the world from Russian and Chinese ships in the Arctic,' Trump said, 'The Danes have added two more sleds in the past two weeks, and they think that's protection.' \nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 09:28 AM\nSource:[Blick.ch](https://www.blick.ch/fr/monde/le-royaume-appelle-a-laide-meme-avec-le-soutien-de-leurope-le-danemark-peut-perdre-le-groenland-id20538232.html)\n\n**Grenlandczyk\u00f3w nie interesuje sprawa do\u0142\u0105czenia do USA, wynika z sonda\u017cu**\nA recent survey conducted by Verian for the Sermitsiaq newspaper in Greenland and the Berlingske media point in Denmark found that 85% of the local population is against the idea of becoming part of the United States. The survey, which consisted of online interviews with 497 randomly selected citizens of Greenland over the age of 18, was conducted between January 22 and 27. Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede has repeatedly rejected the idea of selling the island. 'We don't want to be Danes. We don't want to be Americans. We want to be Greenlanders,' he said earlier this month. The idea of Greenland becoming part of the US was first considered by Trump during his first term, but was rejected by Copenhagen. Egede wants to hold a referendum that could lead to Greenland's independence from Denmark and allow it to plan its future more freely. However, Trump has returned to the idea of taking over Greenland, citing the need to strengthen American presence in the Arctic amidst competition with Russia and China. This has caused concern in Copenhagen and among European governments, particularly after a phone call between Trump and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. Frederiksen has embarked on a diplomatic tour of European capitals to strengthen support for preventing Trump from taking over Greenland by force or economic coercion, which he has threatened to do.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 06:38 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://businessinsider.com.pl/wiadomosci/grenlandia-nie-chce-byc-w-usa-wyniki-sondazu/gdgvvkq)\n\n**Greenland Rejects US Acquisition, Denmark Strengthens Arctic Presence**\nThe people of Greenland have rejected the idea of being sold to the USA, with only 6% of the population supporting the idea, according to Danish newspaper Berlingske. Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede has previously stated that the island is not for sale and that its future is up to the people to decide. Greenland has had extensive self-governance since 2009 and may hold a referendum on independence in the future. Meanwhile, the Danish government has decided to invest 1.46 billion Danish kronor in strengthening its military presence in the Arctic, a move that signals that Copenhagen has no plans to hand over control to Washington, as stated by Prime Minister Egede, 'It is not for sale and it is up to the people to decide its future.' \nOriginal language: sv\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[friatider.se](https://www.friatider.se/gronlanningarna-sager-nej-till-usa)\n\n**Greenland's Quest for Independence: A Response to Trump's Ambitions**\nThe ambitions of US President Donald Trump to annex Greenland have caused a major diplomatic crisis for Denmark. The relations between the new administration in Washington and the Danish government are at an all-time low after Trump's aggressive conversation with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in which he expressed that the US needs to control Greenland. According to sources, the conversation was 'horrible' and 'very tough', and Trump again threatened to impose specific tariffs on the Scandinavian country. Despite the tense relations, the Danish government is trying to show unity with the autonomous government of Nuuk, announcing several social measures and investments to strengthen the military presence and surveillance in the Arctic island. Frederiksen is also trying to gain the support of her European partners, saying that 'European unity has never been more important'. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has condemned any territorial expansion, saying 'borders should not be moved by force'. Meanwhile, the focus on the island's media and Trump's desires for annexation have fueled arguments in favor of independence and the debate on a referendum on self-determination that could be held in the next few years. The Greenlandic government has shown a good disposition to strengthen ties with Washington, but a majority of the parties in the Inatsisartut (the Greenlandic Parliament) have rejected the idea of the US taking control of the island. Instead, a majority of the parties support a future independent Greenland, and the dispute between the US and Denmark seems to have accelerated this process. The Greenlandic government has started working on creating a framework for independence, and a referendum on self-determination is expected to be held in the next four years. According to a study by the University of Copenhagen, seven out of ten Greenlanders would vote in favor of emancipation from the Kingdom of Denmark. One of the key issues in a future referendum on independence will be establishing how long Denmark will continue to subsidize the government of Nuuk. Currently, a third of the public sector in Greenland is financed by an annual contribution from Copenhagen of 4.1 billion kroner (500 million euros). The Danish government also handles justice, police, the prison system, and the surveillance of the territorial waters, as well as having the competences of defense and security of the island. The discovery of natural resources such as rare earth minerals and oil and gas deposits represents a hope for Greenland to leave its economic dependence on Copenhagen's aid, which maintains the current welfare state system. However, economist Torben Andersen from the University of Aarhus notes that 'until now, no large mining projects have been put into operation, while the prospect of extracting millions of barrels of oil has been buried by the enormous costs of doing so in the Arctic'. 'With the most optimistic glasses, it is unlikely that mining will be economically significant for Greenland in a 10-year horizon', concludes Andersen.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 09:05 PM\nSource:[eldiario.es](https://www.eldiario.es/internacional/frente-ambiciones-trump-groenlandia-acumula-pasos-decidir-si-independiza-dinamarca_1_12000023.html)\n\n**Greenlanders living in 'worrying time' amid Trump aggression**\nGreenlanders are living in a 'worrying time' due to Donald Trump's repeated statements about acquiring the Arctic island for the United States.

Fencker says, 'It's urgent, we need to activate paragraph 21 as soon as possible so that Greenland can start negotiations with Denmark and potentially start talks with the US about security in Greenland.' He also believes that this should be done before the upcoming election on April 6. According to the Home Rule Act, the decision on Greenland's independence is made by the Greenlandic people through a referendum.

'My personal opinion is that we should officially start negotiations with Denmark to create a sovereign state of Greenland.

That's why my party has proposed a motion that we should activate our right to self-determination,' Fenchner said in an interview with RIA Novosti. Fenchner also mentioned that Greenland has plans to extend its defense agreement with the US without Denmark's involvement, and that Greenland may sign separate agreements with both Denmark and the EU. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953 and remains part of the kingdom, with autonomy and self-governance granted in 2009. In late December 2024, the Danish defense minister announced plans to significantly increase defense spending on the world's largest island, following US President Donald Trump's statement on acquiring Greenland.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 04:05 AM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7443642)\n\n**Donald Trump, an unlikely ally for Greenland's independence**\nThe Groenlandic people are increasingly seeking independence from Denmark, with over 75% of them wanting to be self-governing.

The current government is considering a cooperation with the US to gain financial independence, while the opposition party Naleraq is pushing for a stronger alliance with the US to exploit the island's hydrocarbons and minerals. Casper Frank M\u00f8ller, a young entrepreneur, believes that the island needs to develop its infrastructure before seeking independence, but sees the visit of Trump as an opportunity for the island to gain new perspectives. Qarsoq H\u00f8egh-Dam, a special advisor to the party Naleraq, estimates that more than 75% of the population wants independence, and that the current government is not doing enough to achieve this goal.

The proposal has put pressure on the Danish government to recognize Greenland's autonomy and its right to determine its own future. Greenland has been an autonomous territory of Denmark since 2009, but the Danish government still has control over its foreign and defense policies. The Greenlandic government has been pushing for full independence, and the US proposal has given them a new opportunity to negotiate with the US.

Mariane Paviasen, the political leader of the ruling party IA, says, 'We want to be able to take care of all tasks in the country ourselves, and we want to be able to decide how and when our country should be run.' Erik Jensen, the chairman of Siumut, also supports independence, saying, 'It is the ambition, and it is what lies in our Greenlandic genes.' However, neither of them sets a specific date for a referendum. A commission has been established to work on the next steps towards independence, and a draft constitution for an independent Greenland was presented in May 2023. The commission has two years to complete its work. Naleraq, the party that most strongly supports independence, does not want to hold a referendum yet, as they want to have a concrete agreement with Denmark before putting it to the people. Demokratit's chairman, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, says, 'We go in for being an independent country, but we cannot set a date for the referendum.

The election campaign will also discuss the defense and economic relationships with the US and Denmark after independence, which is a likely outcome. 'The independence movement is gaining momentum,' said Aya... (Greenland's representative in the Danish parliament). 'The election will be a crucial test of whether Greenland is ready for independence.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 03:20 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCD094NG0Z00C25A1000000/)\n\n**Greenland on the path to independence**\nGreenland is moving towards independence at a record pace, dominating the political debate in the southern part of the Danish kingdom. The path to independence is likely to be a major theme in the upcoming Greenlandic parliament election, scheduled to take place by April 6, 2025. This comes after a draft of a new constitution for Greenland was prepared last year, and most recently, former US President Donald Trump's persistent interest in taking control of Greenland's territory has played a role. 'The path to independence is likely to be a major theme in the upcoming election,' said a source, although no specific details were provided.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 07:58 PM\nSource:[information.dk](https://www.information.dk/indland/2025/01/groenland-paa-vej-selvstaendighed-procedurens-syv-trin)\n\n**Greenlanders Unite: 'We Decide Our Own Future, Not Trump or Denmark'**\nThe Greenlandic people are concerned about the recent statements made by Donald Trump, who has expressed interest in buying the island. However, the Greenlandic government has stated that their future and fight for independence are their own affairs. Many Greenlanders believe that they should be able to decide their own fate, rather than being influenced by external powers. The island's small population of 55,000 people, with 20,000 living in the capital Nuuk, makes it difficult to manage the country's vast territory of 2 million square kilometers. The Greenlandic government has stated that they aim to maintain a balanced relationship with Denmark, without necessarily breaking the union. They believe that if the union is based on equality and self-governance is strengthened, there would be no problem. The Greenlandic people are looking forward to the upcoming elections on April 6, 2025, which will determine the future of the island. According to the Greenland Self Government Act of 2009, the island can declare independence after a referendum, which would be requested and held by the political forces that emerge from the elections. 'We want to decide our own future, not Trump or Denmark,' said Hans-Jakob, a 21-year-old university student. 'The important thing is that it's our decision, not someone else's.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 12:22 AM\nSource:[lastampa.it](https://www.lastampa.it/esteri/2025/01/09/news/tra_gli_inuit_minacciati_da_donald_decidiamo_noi_il_nostro_futuro-14927667/)\n\n**Grenland's Prime Minister Calls for Independence from Denmark**\nGrenland's Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede emphasized his desire for independence from Denmark, marking a significant shift in rhetoric around the island's future, according to Reuters. 'It's time for us to take a step and shape our own future, including with whom we will closely cooperate and who will be our trade partners,' Egede said in his New Year's address. He noted that 'our cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark has not led to achieving full equality.' 'Now it's time for our country to take the next step. Like other countries in the world, we must work to remove obstacles to cooperation that we can describe as the chains of colonialism, and move forward,' Egede said. Egede added that the decision on independence is made by the people of Greenland, but did not say when a vote may take place. It is reported that the government of Greenland twice rejected proposals from US President Donald Trump to buy the island, in 2019 and again in 2024, while Egede claimed that 'Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be sold.' Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in Greenland by April 6.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 06:01 AM\nSource:[interfax.com.ua](https://interfax.com.ua/news/political/1038506.html)\n\n**Greenland's Prime Minister Announces Intent to Achieve Independence from Denmark**\nThe Prime Minister of Greenland, Mute Egede, has announced his intention to achieve independence from Denmark. According to him, the decision should be made by the island's residents, but he did not specify when the vote will take place. 'History and current circumstances have shown that our cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark has not led to full equality. Now it's time for our country to take the next step. Like other countries in the world, we must work to remove obstacles to cooperation that we can call the shackles of colonialism, and move forward. It's time for us to take the step and determine our own future, including who we will closely cooperate with and who will be our trading partners,' Egede said in his New Year's address, as reported by Reuters. This statement comes after US President-elect Donald Trump once again expressed his desire to annex Greenland to the United States, buying it from Denmark. Trump made similar statements in 2019 during his first presidential term. In recent years, the movement for independence in Greenland has been gaining momentum, partly due to revelations of Denmark's wrongdoing in the 20th century, including a forced birth control campaign launched in the 1960s, as reported by the agency. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953, but is now a self-governing territory of Denmark and received the right to declare independence through a referendum in 2009. In 2023, the Greenlandic government presented its first draft of a constitution.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/world/54004224-premer-grenlandii-zayavil-o-namerenii-dobitsya-nezavisimosti-ot-danii/)\n\n**Grenland Prepares for Historic Break with Denmark: Prime Minister Announces Course Towards Independence**\nGrenland is preparing for a historic break with Denmark, with Prime Minister Egede announcing a course towards independence. According to Reuters, Egede stated, 'The time has come for us to take a step forward and define our own future, including with whom we will closely cooperate and who will be our trade partners.' The growing movement for independence in Greenland is partly linked to the revelation of Denmark's unlawful actions in the 20th century, including a forced population control program in the 1960s. Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953, but is now a self-governing territory. In 2009, it gained the right to declare independence through a vote, and in 2023, the government presented its first constitution project. Egede added, 'History and current conditions have shown that our cooperation with the Kingdom of Denmark has not created full equality. The time has come for our country to take the next step. Like other countries in the world, we need to work on removing obstacles to cooperation \u2013 which we can call the chains of colonialism \u2013 and move forward.' However, Egede emphasized that the final decision on independence belongs to the people of Greenland, without specifying when a referendum might take place. The island's population of 57,000 people largely supports the idea of independence, but opinions differ on the timing and potential impact on living standards. Despite significant mineral, oil, and gas reserves, Greenland's economy remains vulnerable, relying on fishing and annual grants from Denmark. Parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place on the island by April 6, which may determine the future path of Greenland.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 06:19 PM\nSource:[mezha.net](https://mezha.net/ua/bukvy/hrenlandiia-hotuietsia-do-istorychnoho-rozryvu-z-daniieiu-prem-ier-anonsuvav-kurs-na-nezalezhnist/)\n\n**Groenlandia's Prime Minister Proposes Independence Referendum Amid Trump's Interest**\nGroenlandia's Prime Minister M\u00fate Egede has called for independence from Denmark and proposed a referendum in conjunction with the April 2025 elections. 'It's time to take the next step for our country,' Egede said in his year-end speech. 'Like other countries in the world, we must work to remove the obstacles to cooperation \u2013 which we can describe as the chains of the colonial era \u2013 and move forward,' he added. The timing of the move coincides with the upcoming inauguration of Donald Trump as US President, who has reiterated his desire to buy Greenland from Denmark, calling it a 'necessity' for Washington's strategic needs. Egede rebuked Trump, saying that Greenland 'is not for sale.' The island is still a Danish territory, despite having its own parliament since 1979, and Copenhagen still sets the foreign policy and defense line. Egede argued that this situation has not created 'full equality' for the Arctic island. 'Our cooperation with other countries and our commercial relations cannot continue to be carried out only through Denmark,' he said. 'The work to create a framework for Greenland as an independent state has already begun. We need to take important steps... The upcoming new electoral period must, together with the citizens, create these new steps,' Egede concluded.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 06:02 PM\nSource:[meteoweb.eu](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2025/01/groenlandia-verso-indipendenza-referendum/1001723615/)\n\n",
