According to the Kcna, Kim visited a site for the production of nuclear materials and the Nuclear Weapons Institute, where he praised the 'successes' and emphasized the importance of developing a nuclear deterrent. Kim stated, 'It is our firm position, at the political and military level, as well as a noble and constant duty, to develop the nuclear reaction position of the state to the fullest extent.' This comes after North Korea conducted its first missile test since Donald Trump's return to the White House. Trump, in a recent interview with Fox News, referred to Kim as a 'smart person' and hinted at the possibility of new talks.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 09:28 AM\nSource:[DAGOSPIA](http://www.dagospia.com/cronache/kim-jong-fa-voce-grossa-annuncia-2025-sara-anno-cruciale-per-rafforzare-422781)\n\n**North Korea\u2019s Kim Urges Strengthening of Nuclear Forces in 2025, KCNA Reports**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for the expansion of the country's nuclear forces in 2025, during a visit to a nuclear material production base and a nuclear weapons institute, according to state media KCNA. Kim praised the achievements of scientists and workers, and stressed the need for continued progress in nuclear material production, calling 2025 a critical year for bolstering the country's nuclear forces. He stated, 'This year is a crucial year as it is an important watershed in which we should carry out the tasks in the important period in the course of implementing the line of bolstering up the nuclear forces.' Kim added that North Korea faces 'the world's most unstable security situation' due to ongoing hostilities with 'the most vicious hostile countries,' making it essential for the country to strengthen its nuclear capability. Analysts estimate that North Korea may have enough fissile material to produce up to 90 nuclear warheads.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 07:32 AM\nSource:[arise.tv](https://www.arise.tv/north-koreas-kim-urges-strengthening-of-nuclear-forces-in-2025-kcna-reports/)\n\n**Kim Jong-un Calls for Strengthening North Korea's Nuclear Shield**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for the strengthening of the country's nuclear shield in light of the unstable global situation. Kim Jong-un said, 'The security situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is the most unstable in the world.' He added, 'We are destined to face a longer confrontation with the most aggressive hostile forces. We are responsible, not only for today, but for the future of this country. Therefore, the question of continuously strengthening the nuclear shield is inevitable.' According to the Central Korean News Agency, Kim Jong-un visited a nuclear production base and a nuclear weapons institute, describing 'strengthening nuclear readiness' as 'the main task' and the stable military and political stance of North Korea. The agency emphasized that 2025 will be a crucial year for North Korea in strengthening its nuclear power, stating, 'This year will be a pivotal one, meaning it will be a turning point in the implementation of our party's and government's plan to strengthen nuclear forces, and in particular, we will complete the main tasks of the five-year plan and move on to the implementation of the next tasks.' In the context of strengthening its capabilities and potential, North Korea recently successfully tested a strategic cruise missile launched from underwater, and vowed to take 'the most severe countermeasures'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 06:21 AM\nSource:[almayadeen.net](https://www.almayadeen.net/news/politics/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%86%D8%BA-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%88-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%88%D9%88%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9)\n\n**North Korea's Kim Vows Nuclear Programme to Continue Indefinitely**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed that Pyongyang's nuclear programme will continue 'indefinitely', according to state media.

Kim Jong Un emphasized that 2025 will be a 'crucial year' for strengthening the country's nuclear forces, saying it is their 'firm political and military position and our sacred duty to unrestrictedly develop our state's nuclear weapons retaliation capability.' This stance follows a series of intensive ballistic missile tests by North Korea last year, defying UN Security Council resolutions and sanctions.

He added, 'The security and peace of our country can only be guaranteed by the power of the strong.' Kim also stated, 'The development of nuclear defense capabilities is not just a military option, but also a political one.' He emphasized that the country's nuclear defense capabilities must be continuously developed and strengthened. Kim's comments come as North Korea is expected to follow a new policy under the Trump administration. In a previous statement, Trump referred to North Korea as a 'nuclear power' and said, 'I think he'll be happy to see me back in the White House.' Trump also called Kim 'a smart guy' and said he would 'be in touch with him again.' Trump's comments were seen as a signal for diplomacy with North Korea.

North Korea claims it is seeking nuclear weapons to counter threats from the United States and its allies, including South Korea. Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at a low point, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of United Nations sanctions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[Malay Mail](https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2025/01/29/north-koreas-kim-vows-nuclear-programme-to-continue/164866)\n\n**North Korean Leader Calls for Strengthening Nuclear Arsenal**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for the strengthening of his country's nuclear arsenal in 2024, according to the Central News Agency of North Korea. This comes as South Korea warned of US efforts to disarm Pyongyang. On Wednesday, the Central News Agency reported that Kim Jong-un called for the strengthening of North Korea's nuclear arsenal this year, during a visit to a base used to produce nuclear materials. This call coincides with a statement from South Korea that US President Donald Trump will work to disarm North Korea. During his first term, Trump's relationship with Kim was marked by openness, with the two leaders meeting in a rare and historic event. North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in September 2006, which was later confirmed by international intelligence agencies. In September 2022, North Korea's parliament declared the country a nuclear state, with Kim Jong-un stating that possessing nuclear weapons is irreversible. North Korea's last nuclear test was in September 2017, where it announced it had detonated a hydrogen bomb, its most powerful nuclear test yet, with an estimated yield of 100-250 kilotons, causing a 6.3 magnitude earthquake. Since then, North Korea has not conducted any nuclear tests, but has continued to develop its ballistic missile program. A law passed by the parliament in Pyongyang gives North Korea the right to launch preemptive nuclear strikes in self-defense, including against traditional attacks or direct threats to its leadership. At the time, Kim Jong-un ruled out any talks on nuclear disarmament, accusing the US of trying to overthrow his regime through sanctions, saying that North Korea would not surrender even after '100 years' of sanctions. In response to the announcement, the US reaffirmed its commitment to nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula, while North Korea rejected South Korean offers of aid in exchange for giving up nuclear weapons, calling it 'the height of absurdity'. North Korea conducted 6 nuclear tests between 2006 and 2017.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 11:03 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/north-korea-to-boost-nuclear-arsenal)\n\n**North Korea Launches Test Missiles Ahead of Trump's Return to White House**\nNorth Korea launched several test missiles on Tuesday towards its eastern waters, according to the South Korean army, as it continues to demonstrate its military capabilities before President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House. The Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea stated that the weapons were launched from an interior area of the north, and it is suspected that they were short-range ballistic missiles. The exact distance they traveled is still unclear. The South Korean army has also strengthened its vigilance and shared the information of the launch with the armies of the United States and Japan. This was the second North Korean launch event in 2025, following a ballistic launch last week. North Korea stated that the January 6 test was of a new hypersonic missile with intermediate range designed to hit remote targets in the Pacific, while leader Kim Jong Un committed to further expanding his collection of nuclear-capable arms to counter rival nations. Last year was intense for Pyongyang in terms of military demonstrations. The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to hit the continental United States, and several short-range missiles intended to bypass South Korea's missile defenses. There are concerns that its military capabilities could progress further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries have allied in the war against Ukraine. In a year-end political conference, Kim promised to implement the toughest policy against the United States, and criticized the efforts of the government of President Joe Biden to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he said are a nuclear military bloc for aggression. The state media of North Korea did not specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comment on Trump. During his first term in the presidency, Trump met with Kim three times to discuss the North Korean nuclear program. Even with Trump's return to the White House, it is unlikely that there will be a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 07:30 AM\nSource:[Z\u00f3calo Saltillo](https://www.zocalo.com.mx/4178033-2/)\n\n**North Korea launches projectile toward eastern waters in 2nd launch...**\nNorth Korea has launched at least one unidentified projectile toward its eastern waters, according to South Korea's military.

North Korea has been expanding its nuclear-capable weapons collection, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the U.S. mainland. Experts say that Kim Jong Un's strengthened position, built on his expanded nuclear arsenal and deepening alliance with Russia, presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff. 'It was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific,' North Korea said of its previous test. 'We will implement the toughest anti-U.S. policy,' Kim vowed at a year-end political conference. 'A nuclear military bloc for aggression' is how he described the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo. The exact distance the projectile flew is not yet clear. 'It wasn't immediately clear how far the weapon flew,' according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The US reaffirmed its commitment to the security of South Korea, stating that it would use its full arsenal, including nuclear weapons, to defend its allies. The two sides agreed to continue integrating joint military exercises aimed at strengthening deterrence. A plan of activities for the first half of 2025 was also approved. The next meeting of the group is scheduled to take place in South Korea. The creation of the consultative group was a result of agreements reached in April 2023.

The launch came two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in South Korea for talks with the acting president at the time. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff called the launch a 'clear provocation' and said it was monitoring the situation and sharing information with the United States and Japan. Trump had previously met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term as president, but made no progress on efforts to get him to abandon his nuclear and missile programs. Trump has picked an aide who was involved in planning the summits with Kim, William Beau Harrison, to be an assistant to the president and deputy chief of staff for operations. Harrison played a critical role in planning the historic summits with Kim, including the first meeting in Singapore in June 2018.

According to a statement by EU spokesperson Anitta Hippert, this 'violates numerous UN Security Council resolutions and further escalates tensions on the Korean Peninsula.' The EU expresses solidarity with its regional partners, including South Korea and Japan, and calls on North Korea to cease its unlawful and escalatory actions and engage in dialogue. North Korea claims that the missile was equipped with a hypersonic warhead. The country has been conducting regular ballistic missile launches into the East and Yellow Seas, and has repeatedly declared its 'incontestable status as a nuclear state.' This is not the first time North Korea has tested a ballistic missile, having conducted several tests in the past year, including a simulated attack on South Korea in March 2023, a nuclear-capable underwater drone test in April 2023, and a ballistic missile launch in July 2023. In October 2024, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un stated that the country would accelerate its efforts to become a military nuclear superpower and would not hesitate to use its nuclear capabilities if attacked. 'This is a successful test of our new hypersonic ballistic missile,' Kim said, adding that the production of such weapons is 'a restraint on nuclear war.' The missile was launched from a site near Pyongyang and reached a maximum altitude of 99.8 km at a speed 12 times the speed of sound, before falling into the open sea 1,500 km away, according to Kim.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 06:07 PM\nSource:[gordonua.com](https://gordonua.com/ukr/news/worldnews/jevropejskij-sojuz-zasudiv-kndr-za-zapusk-novoji-balistichnoji-raketi--1729232.html)\n\n**North Korea says latest weapons test was new hypersonic intermediate-range missile**\nNorth Korea has announced that its latest weapons test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile capable of striking remote targets in the Pacific.

The missile was launched from the Pyongyang area, traveling approximately 1,100 kilometers before splashing down in the East Sea. This test marks North Korea's first missile launch since November 2024, when it launched several short-range ballistic missiles. The nature and specifications of the missile are still unclear, but analysts believe it may be a supersonic missile, a advanced version of the missiles tested in January and April 2024. Japanese and South Korean authorities quickly confirmed the incident, with the Japanese Ministry of Defense reporting the impact of the object in the sea shortly after its launch. This missile test comes at a time when Blinken is meeting with his South Korean counterparts to strengthen the strategic alliance between Seoul and Washington amidst a period of political instability in South Korea. South Korea is currently experiencing a period of uncertainty after President Yoon Suk-yeol announced the imposition of martial law last month, leading to his arrest and leaving the leadership temporarily in the hands of Finance Minister Choo Sang-moo. Blinken praised the flexibility of democracy in South Korea, emphasizing the US commitment to supporting its ally during this difficult period. North Korea has seen significant expansion in its ballistic missile capabilities in recent years, developing a diverse arsenal including short-range missiles like the KN-23 and KN-25, as well as intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15, which can reach the US mainland. In 2024, North Korea increased its missile activities, including the launch of the advanced Hwasong-19 missile and the launch of Hwasong-11D missiles near the southern border, reflecting a strategy aimed at enhancing its nuclear deterrence and presence on the international stage. The timing of this launch raises questions about its political motivations. Some analysts suggest it may be an attempt to draw attention from the incoming US President Donald Trump, who is set to take office in two weeks, and possibly reinitiate stalled talks on nuclear disarmament, although Pyongyang appears cautious about restarting negotiations. The report also suggests that Russia may have provided North Korea with satellite technology in exchange for military support in Ukraine, which has increased international concerns, with Blinken emphasizing the importance of strengthening cooperation between Seoul and Tokyo to counter the threats from Pyongyang and China's growing influence in the region. In response to the launch, South Korea fired missiles into the sea as a show of deterrence, demonstrating its commitment to countering any provocations, despite internal political challenges. Meanwhile, South Korean and US forces remain on high alert, ready to respond to any further escalations. The incident highlights the ongoing security challenges in the Korean Peninsula, with the region facing critical months in both military and diplomatic spheres, amidst rising tensions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 06:45 AM\nSource:[alnahdanews.com](https://alnahdanews.com/article/155956-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%84%D9%82-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE-%D9%81%D9%8A-2025-%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A)\n\n**North Korea tensions ramps up as hermit country 'fires hypersonic missiles'**\nNorth Korea has conducted its first major weapons test of 2025, launching a hypersonic missile from Pyongyang that landed in the Sea of Japan. The missile, which was fired at around midday local time on Monday, travelled 690 miles before hitting the sea, according to South Korea's Chief of Staff. The exact type of weapon used is not yet known, but officials say its characteristics are similar to those of a hypersonic missile tested twice last year. This escalation of tensions in the region has raised concerns about the country's military capabilities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1996908/north-korea-fires-hypersonic-missiles-test)\n\n**North Korea Conducts First Ballistic Missile Test of 2025 Amid Blinken's Visit to South Korea**\nNorth Korea conducted its first ballistic missile test of the year on January 6, 2025, at the same time as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to South Korea. According to the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, the missile was launched from the vicinity of Pyongyang and flew approximately 1,100 kilometers before landing in the Japanese Sea, outside of Japan's exclusive economic zone. The missile is believed to have been equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle, highlighting North Korea's continued development of such technology. This test is similar to previous ones in January and April 2024, and if confirmed, would set a new record for the longest distance flown by a North Korean hypersonic missile. The test also suggests that North Korea is improving the performance of its solid-fueled rocket engines. As Blinken condemned the test, he also warned that Russia may deepen its ties with North Korea and provide advanced satellite technology, but emphasized that the US and South Korea will maintain their strong alliance and work together to counter North Korea's provocations. 'We will continue to work closely with Japan and other partners to address the threat posed by North Korea's ballistic missile program,' Blinken said. 'We will not be deterred by North Korea's provocations, and we will continue to work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 05:10 PM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%B9%B3%E5%A3%A4%E4%BB%8A%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E5%BA%A6%E5%B0%84%E5%BD%88-%E9%81%A9%E9%80%A2%E5%B8%83%E6%9E%97%E8%82%AF%E8%A8%AA%E9%9F%93-160000070.html)\n\n",

The last test was in September 2017. Historically, North Korea's behavior is often unpredictable, and they have demonstrated cycles of provocation followed by diplomacy. The gap of several years since the last test suggests a historical base rate of a nuclear test approximately every 4 to 5 years. Thus, as it is currently 2025, the base rate could support a moderate probability of testing soon, suggesting an initial probability of about 50%.",
