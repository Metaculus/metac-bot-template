The flight placed a Tesla Roadster, attached to the second stage, into solar orbit, reaching as far as the orbit of Mars. The Falcon Heavy is composed of three reusable first-stage boosters of the Falcon 9, linked together side by side. The combination created the most powerful operational rocket of the time, with its 27 Merlin engines combined generating over 5 million pounds of thrust, sufficient to place 141,000 pounds in a low-inclination Earth orbit or send 37,000 pounds to Mars. The demonstrative Falcon Heavy took off from launch pad 39A in the local afternoon of February 6, 2018. After burnout and separation, the two lateral boosters performed spectacular parallel landings in zones 1 and 2 of the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, renamed Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in December 2020. Two of the central core's engines did not ignite for the landing burn, preventing the recovery of that stage on the drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. For this demonstration flight, the Falcon Heavy carried a Tesla Roadster as the sole payload, fixed permanently to the second stage. Behind the wheel of the Tesla was a mannequin nicknamed Starman, wearing a SpaceX launch and re-entry suit. The upper stage of the Falcon Heavy, with the Tesla attached, entered an elliptical parking orbit around the Earth, passing through the Van Allen radiation belts of the planet. The onboard cameras continued to transmit live images of Starman and the Tesla against the backdrop of the Earth until the batteries ran out four hours after launch. Two hours later, the second stage reignited to send this and the Tesla into an heliocentric orbit with its farthest point beyond the orbit of Mars.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 04:16 AM\nSource:[meteoweb.eu](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2025/02/6-febbraio-2018-primo-lancio-razzo-falcon-heavy/1001742130/)\n\n**Damage to Atmosphere from Starship Explosion Comparable to Meteorite Falls**\nThe explosion of the upper stage of the Starship at an altitude of 146 km has caused damage to the atmosphere comparable to that of meteorite falls. The exact environmental damage is difficult to assess, as it is unclear how much of the rocket burned up in the atmosphere and how much fell into the ocean. Fortunately, the stage was made of stainless steel, not aluminum, which would have released toxic aluminum oxide into the ozone layer upon burning. However, the release of nitrogen oxides from the destruction of objects at hypersonic speeds can also have a negative impact on the atmosphere. Researchers note that these assessments are preliminary, but the incident has already raised questions about the long-term impact of space launches on the Earth's ecology.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 06:58 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/54160097-uscherb-atmosfere-ot-vzryva-starship-sopostavim-s-padeniem-meteoritov/)\n\n**Boeing Reports Record Loss Due to Starliner Spacecraft Program**\nBoeing reported a record loss of $523 million in 2024 due to the Starliner spacecraft program.

According to Space.com, the rocket was launched on February 4th as part of mission NS-29 to conduct scientific experiments for future lunar expeditions. The launch took place from the Corn Ranch launch site near the city of Van Horn in western Texas at 11:00 EST (19:00 MSK). The flight lasted around 10 minutes, after which the capsule successfully landed on Earth, while the rocket returned to the landing site about 7 minutes later. It was initially planned to launch on January 28th, but the flight was postponed due to unfavorable weather conditions and issues with the rocket's avionics. Blue Origin's New Shepard has previously completed a suborbital flight with a commercial crew of six space tourists from the US and Canada in November last year. The company, founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos, has been leading the commercial space tourism industry since 2021, followed by Virgin Galactic's Richard Branson.

The Super Heavy booster and Starship separated at T+2:40, at an altitude of 91 kilometers. The Booster 14 (B14) was captured without issues by the Mechazilla tower. The 71-meter-long rocket was caught with the giant robotic arms. It is the second Super Heavy to be recovered. Despite one of the central engines failing in a previous maneuver, all engines were successfully ignited. SpaceX reused a Raptor engine from the flight number 5. The Starship 33 (S33) exploded at T+8:26, at an altitude of 146 km, due to a fire caused by a propellant leak in the rear of the ship. Elon Musk believes that a new Starship will be ready to fly in a month. Musk stated that his company will launch the first mission to Mars. 'The first spacecraft to Mars will launch within two years, when the next Earth-Mars transfer window opens. There will be no crew to check the reliability of a damage-free landing on Mars,' he said. The B14/S33 combination measures 123.1 meters, the tallest rocket in history. As Elon Musk said, 'It's like going to Mars without a rocket.'

The Starship rocket, the largest and most powerful ever built, is designed to return humans to the Moon (as part of NASA's Artemis program) and then to Mars. The test aimed to replicate all that had been done successfully in previous attempts, including the automatic capture of the booster with robotic arms (which was successful), and the release of a cargo of fake Starlink satellites into space. Unfortunately, something went wrong. The booster was captured successfully about 7 minutes after launch, but at T+8:26 minutes from liftoff, SpaceX lost contact with the Ship capsule, which is the upper part of Starship. According to preliminary reconstructions by SpaceX, a loss of propellant caused the progressive shutdown of the Starship engines and then the disintegration of the capsule, which exploded in flight at 8:26 pm on January 16, 2025. The explosion occurred at an altitude of about 150 km over the Caribbean, with the debris subsequently re-entering and burning up in the atmosphere over the Lesser Antilles, as shown in the spectacular video posted by Musk himself on X. SpaceX is collaborating with the FAA (the US agency responsible for civil aviation) to understand the reasons for the test failure, but the Musk company has already announced that this setback will not cause any delay in the upcoming test programs of Starship scheduled for 2025. 'We will add a new and refined fire suppression system and valves with increased capacity,' said SpaceX.

Although the mission appears to be similar to the previous two, there are significant changes to the test. The second-generation Starship has undergone major modifications, including a 25% increase in internal fuel capacity, a reduction in the size of the front wing, and a slight rearward movement. This should significantly reduce the exposure of the front wing to high-temperature plasma during re-entry, simplify the insulation layout, and avoid the 'burn-through' issues seen in previous tests. The Starship has also been upgraded with repeated use in mind, including improved navigation systems, additional batteries and power systems, and increased camera numbers. SpaceX has also integrated Starlink, navigation, and wireless backup communication systems to provide stable communication and high-quality live streaming. IFT-7 will also test various special metal insulation bricks, including one with active heat dissipation. The landing sensor on the launch tower has been reinforced to prevent damage from the impact of the rocket. The test will also attempt to recover and reuse the Raptor engine, which has been used in IFT-5. Additionally, the Starship will carry 10 Starlink V3 'simulators' to test the deployment of satellites. However, due to the failure to reach orbit, all these tests will be conducted in a sub-orbital environment and will be destroyed in the atmosphere shortly after release. The final test will be the re-ignition of the Raptor engine in space, which is essential for future orbit insertion and departure.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 09:14 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/starship-ift-7-changes-090017884.html)\n\n**Starship Completes Four Test Flights in 2024, Sets Stage for Mars Mission**\nThe Starship, a massive and powerful rocket, has completed four new flights in the past year. The 124-meter-tall rocket, with a power equivalent to 33 Boeing 747 jets, is crucial for plans to return humans to the Moon and eventually send them to Mars. The first test flight of the year took place on March 14, building on the success of the previous flight and adding new features such as a fuel transfer test in orbit. However, the test ended in failure when the Starship exploded at 65 kilometers due to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. The second test flight on June 6 was more successful, with the rocket's heat shield resisting the heat and completing its space journey. The third test flight on October 13 saw the debut of the 'Mechazilla', a giant robotic arm that successfully captured the rocket's booster. The final test flight on November 19 was intended to repeat the 'caza' maneuver, but a problem with the tower prevented it from happening.

The test was shared on social media, showing the upper stage being transported to the test site and then undergoing the static fire test. Although the official launch date has not been confirmed, a NASA communication to the FAA suggests that January 11 could be the designated launch day. Starship is a revolutionary spacecraft that can be completely reused, with both the upper stage and the Super Heavy booster designed to return to the launch site and be caught in mid-air using a 'chopsticks' system. This approach reduces costs and preparation times for future flights, a crucial step towards a more sustainable access to space. SpaceX has demonstrated the potential of the Starship system in previous flights, but also faced challenges, such as communication issues during the 6th flight. Despite these difficulties, the progress made in 2024 shows the company's commitment to perfecting the system. The 7th flight of Starship will be the first launch of 2025, continuing the accelerated pace of missions established in 2024. The success of Starship is not only important for SpaceX, but also for the future of global space exploration.

IFT-7 will be the first Starship launch of 2025, following four Starship launches in 2024, and is expected to increase the number of Starship launches in the coming year.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 14, 2024 08:14 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2024/12/14/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-SpaceX-%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE-Starship-%D9%84%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1/6811462)\n\n**SpaceX Prepares for Seventh Starship Launch, Targets January 11 for Integrated Flight Test**\nSpaceX is preparing for the seventh launch of its Starship rocket, which is expected to take place in the coming month. The company has recently conducted a static fire test for the Super Heavy stage and has now prepared the upper stage of Starship for its own tests. According to a post on X, 'Starship is ready for testing before the seventh flight', with photos showing the Starship vehicle moving to the test stand at the Starbase facility in southern Texas. The exact date of the integrated flight test (IFT) has not been announced by SpaceX, but a NASA email to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has identified January 11 as a potential target. When the Starship upper stage is stacked on top of Super Heavy, the combined vehicle reaches a height of approximately 400 feet (122 meters), making it the tallest rocket ever built. The upper stage, known as Ship, is 165 feet (50 meters) tall on its own. Starship is the first fully reusable launch vehicle; both Super Heavy and Ship are designed to return to their respective launch sites and be caught by a Starship recovery tower. SpaceX attempted to catch Super Heavy during IFT-5, which launched in October, and succeeded; the arms caught the returning booster perfectly. The company wanted to attempt another catch of the Super Heavy booster during IFT-6, which launched on November 19, but communication issues with the tower ruined that attempt, and Super Heavy instead made a controlled water landing in the Gulf of Mexico. IFT-7 will be the first Starship launch of 2025, and this year has seen four Starship launches, spread across March, June, October, and November, doubling the number of Starship launches compared to 2023. It is expected that the number of Starship launches will increase in 2025, as Starship has met the operational qualification requirements.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 14, 2024 08:13 PM\nSource:[sahafahh.net](https://arab.sahafahh.net/story/21780588/%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-spacex-%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AE-starship-%D9%84)\n\n**SpaceX rolls 7th Starship spacecraft out for testing ahead of next launch (photos)**\nSpaceX's Starship megarocket is preparing for its seventh launch, expected within the next month. The upper stage, known as Ship, has been prepped for testing and is set to be stacked atop the Super Heavy first-stage booster. According to NASA, the likely target date for the integrated test flight (IFT) is January 11. When fully assembled, the Starship vehicle stands at nearly 400 feet tall, making it the largest rocket ever built. SpaceX aims to make the Starship launch reusable, with both the Super Heavy and Ship designed to return to their launch sites and be caught mid-air by the launch tower's 'chopstick arms'. The company has successfully caught a returning booster in the past, and is working towards operational qualification for the Starship vehicle, which has been tapped by NASA as the lunar lander for the Artemis 3 mission to the moon.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 07:36 PM\nSource:[Space.com](https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/spacex-rolls-7th-starship-spacecraft-out-for-testing-ahead-of-next-launch-photos)\n\n",
