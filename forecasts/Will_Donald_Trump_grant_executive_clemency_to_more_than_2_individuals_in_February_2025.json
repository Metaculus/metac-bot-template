He suddenly put everyone out the door.**\nThe U.S. administration, led by President Donald Trump, has announced the closure of the 2,000-person staff at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), with all but a small portion of employees being placed on mandatory leave. According to a written notification, 'As of 23:59 Turkish time on Sunday, February 23, 2025, all personnel directly hired by USAID, except for those responsible for critical missions, essential leadership, and specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave worldwide.' This decision comes after a federal judge allowed the Trump administration to lay off thousands of USAID employees. Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stated that employees were 'placed on administrative leave' due to issues with USAID executives. However, a subsequent court ruling has temporarily reinstated funding for all foreign aid programs financed by USAID.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 06:14 AM\nSource:[Haberler.com](https://en.haberler.com/critical-decision-from-trump-he-suddenly-put-18404952/?utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=tavsiye_et)\n\n**Notification of Administrative Leave (USAID website)**\nAs of 11:59 p.m. EST on February 23, 2025, all USAID direct hire personnel, except for designated essential personnel, will be placed on administrative leave globally.

According to a notice sent to USAID workers, 'all USAID direct hire personnel, with the exception of designated personnel responsible for mission-critical functions, core leadership and/or specially designated programs, will be placed on administrative leave globally' as of February 23, 2025. The move is part of a month-long assault on the agency, which has also closed its headquarters in Washington and shut down thousands of U.S. aid and development programs worldwide. Trump and Elon Musk, who is referred to as 'First Buddy', contend that the aid and development work is wasteful and furthers a liberal agenda.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 11:12 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

According to Trump, he could not tolerate the fact that 'criminals who got out of prisons and psychiatric institutions are being dropped off by buses and pouring into the United States.' Trump said, 'So I said I'm going to run for president again.' He claimed that the problem is now 'gone'. Trump has repeatedly spoken about his plans to deport illegal migrants from the US and strengthen immigration policy during his presidential campaigns in 2016, 2020, and 2024. Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, took the oath of office on January 20, 2025, and Trump signed an executive order that significantly limits the acquisition of citizenship by birthright, according to The Washington Post and CNN. The order prohibits the issuance of citizenship documents to children born in the US to parents without a valid status, and the restrictions apply to children born within 30 days of the executive order's signing.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 07:20 AM\nSource:[gordonua.com](https://gordonua.com/ukr/news/politics/tramp-rozpoviv-chomu-virishiv-znovu-balotuvatisja-u-prezidenti-ssha-1734346.html)\n\n**What Now?! \u2013 February 22, 2025**\nThe Trump administration is taking steps to consolidate power and undermine the authority of Congress and the judiciary. Senate Republicans have passed a 'skinny' budget resolution, which is seen as out of step with the Trump administration's broader legislative agenda. Meanwhile, the administration is freezing federal grants, cutting spending on medical research and foreign aid, and idling entire agencies. Trump's allies are also pushing for a 'pardon czar' to oversee clemency decisions. Additionally, the administration is facing criticism for its handling of the Ukraine crisis, with some Republicans expressing concerns about Trump's approach to foreign policy. The article also mentions various other issues, including the impact of Trump's policies on education, healthcare, and the environment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[bluedelaware.com](https://bluedelaware.com/2025/02/22/what-now-february-22-2025/)\n\n**The Breakdown Episode 32 \u2013 Protest & Policy: Shasta County Reacts to Trump\u2019s Executive Orders**\nA protest of over 400 people took place in Shasta County on February 17, 2025, in response to President Trump's executive orders, including the dismantling of DEI programs, proposed Social Security changes, and Elon Musk's role in federal budget cuts. The protest was organized by the 50501 movement, which aims to hold 50 protests in 50 states on the same day. Critics argue that Trump's policies, such as the Make America Healthy Again initiative, rely on pseudoscience and could restrict access to necessary health care services for neurodivergent individuals. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) grant to Elon Musk's private entity raises concerns about the lack of transparency in budget cuts and the potential impact on essential social services. Protesters also voiced concerns about proposed changes to Social Security, which could dramatically alter benefits and reduce assistance for many retirees. The protest was largely peaceful, but tensions ran high when counter-protesters arrived, highlighting the deep divisions within the country. However, some counter-protesters engaged in civil discourse, demonstrating that dialogue remains possible even in the face of disagreement. The protest marked a new wave of civic involvement from a younger generation, signaling potential long-term involvement in local and national activism.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 02:10 AM\nSource:[anewscafe.com](https://anewscafe.com/2025/02/21/redding/the-breakdown-episode-33-protest-policy-shasta-county-reacts-to-trumps-executive-orders/)\n\n**The alternate reality of Trump\u2019s Black History Month celebration**\nDuring Trump's Black History Month celebration, the mostly Black audience in the White House seemed disconnected from recent history. No one questioned Trump's elimination of an environmental justice program that provided 40% of federal climate investments to Black and Brown communities, or his revocation of the 1965 executive order banning racial discrimination in government employment. Trump spent his time on stage shouting out Black Republicans and lied about the Biden-Harris administration's 'The 1619 Project', which he claimed reduced American history to a single year. He also lied about winning 40% of the Black vote in 2024, when in reality he got 13%. The audience did not seem bothered by Trump's pardoning of two police officers convicted in the murder of a Black man or his clemency to 1,500 insurrectionists. Trump's only Black cabinet member, HUD Secretary Scott Turner, said 'Every day I\u2019ma lay it down for the people of America', but has failed to do so, particularly for Black people facing racial discrimination in home appraisals. The article concludes that the audience has created a 'miraculous cognitive dissonance' that allows them to believe Trump is their hero, despite his racist policies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 07:02 PM\nSource:[stlamerican.com](https://www.stlamerican.com/election/the-alternate-reality-of-trumps-black-history-month-celebration/)\n\n**More Executive Orders Addressing the Size and Authority of the Federal Government**\nPresident Trump issued three executive orders on February 18 and 19, 2025, aimed at reducing the size and authority of the federal government. The orders direct agencies to classify regulations into seven categories, including those that are unconstitutional or raise constitutional difficulties, and to terminate enforcement proceedings that do not comply with the directive. The orders also require independent agencies to go through the regulatory review process, and eliminate non-statutory components and functions of certain entities. Additionally, the orders instruct the heads of departments and agencies to terminate certain committees and councils, and recommend additional entities to be terminated within 30 days.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 12:20 PM\nSource:[natlawreview.com](https://natlawreview.com/article/more-executive-orders-aimed-improving-operation-federal-government)\n\n**Pardons And Commutations Are Suddenly Vogue**\nThe presidential pardon is a powerful tool for executive clemency, granting the President of the United States the authority to forgive federal offenses and restore rights and privileges. Since Donald Trump took office, thousands of pardons and commutations have taken place, with Trump pardoning nearly 1,500 January 6 Rioters and former Illinois government Rod Blagojevich. Critics argue that the pardon power can be used for political expediency or to shield allies from accountability, potentially undermining the justice system's integrity. However, proponents see it as a means of compassion and correction, with many people seeking pardons for past convictions. Kay Rogers, a single mother of 6 who served two years in federal prison for a bank loan that never materialized, is one such individual, saying 'I've paid my debt to society long ago, I just want to move on with my life.' The pardon office is always busy, and Trump is considering appointing Alice Johnson, who was pardoned in 2020, as the Pardon Czar. The presidential pardon remains a complex instrument within the U.S. legal system, reflecting the delicate balance between justice and mercy, authority and accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:27 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/walterpavlo/2025/02/19/pardons-and-commutations-are-suddenly-vogue/)\n\n**Trump's First Month in Office: Tariffs, Immigration, and International Withdrawal**\nUS President Donald Trump has been in office for a month, during which he has issued executive orders -68 to 19 February- to remove alliances and use tariffs as a tool to pressure concessions. Trump has decreed a pause in all immigration requests from Latin American and Ukrainian migrants allowed in the US under certain programs of the Biden era, citing concerns of fraud and security, according to two US officials and an internal memo obtained by CBS News. The tariffs have allowed for trade advantages but also in migration and security, forcing each country to negotiate directly with the US. Trump has imposed tariffs of 25% on Canada and Mexico, as well as 10% on Chinese products. He has also applied tariffs of 25% on aluminum and steel imports. Trump has declared a national emergency on the US-Mexico border and deployed 15,000 troops to 'ensure' the border and repel 'forms of invasion.' Mass detentions of undocumented immigrants have begun, with nearly 1,000 people arrested in one day to be deported to their countries of origin. Trump has also ordered the activation of 30,000 beds at the Guantanamo naval base to detain undocumented immigrants; the first 10 arrived on February 4. Trump has also proposed renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America' and has established February 9 as its official day. This has outraged his Mexican neighbors. Trump has also withdrawn the US from various international organizations and agreements, including the Paris Climate Agreement, the World Health Organization, and the OECD. He has also cut aid to USAID, the institution that provides aid to developing countries. Trump has also proposed a plan to end the war in Ukraine, which has been met with criticism from the international community. He has also proposed a plan to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to countries such as Egypt or Jordan and to rebuild the territory as the new 'Oriental Riviera', a plan that has been widely criticized.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[lavozdeyopal.co](https://www.lavozdeyopal.co/trump-endurece-politicas-contra-migrantes-latinos-y-ucranianos-tras-un-mes-de-mandato/)\n\n**Justice Department broadens Trump's Jan. 6 clemency as it moves to drop gun cases**\nThe Justice Department has broadened President Donald Trump's clemency for Jan. 6 rioters to include unrelated crimes discovered during FBI searches. This move allows prosecutors to drop gun charges against two former Jan. 6 defendants, Daniel Ball and Elias Costianes, citing Trump's Day 1 executive order granting mass clemency to Jan. 6 defendants. The order issued pardons to roughly 1,500 people who had been convicted of 'offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol' on Jan. 6, 2021. Assistant U.S. Attorney David Bornstein wrote in a filing, 'After consulting with the Department of Justice's leadership, the United States has concluded that the President pardoned Mr. Costianes of the offenses in the indictment.' The Justice Department's new position marks the latest push by the new administration to absolve Jan. 6 defendants, whom Trump and his supporters have described as political prisoners and victims of persecution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 12:51 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/justice-department-broadens-trump-jan-004157979.html)\n\n**Donald Trump Grants Clemency to 23 Anti-Abortion Activists**\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 23, granting clemency to 23 anti-abortion activists who were convicted of blocking access to clinics where abortions are performed. 'These people should never have been prosecuted,' Trump said, adding that 'it's a great honor to sign this order.' The announcement came ahead of a major anti-abortion rally in Washington, known as the 'March for Life.' Trump is expected to participate via video conference, while Vice President J.D. Vance will be present in person. Trump had maintained a deliberately ambiguous stance on abortion during his election campaign, saying he would leave the issue to individual states. However, he has repeatedly taken credit for the Supreme Court's decision in June 2022 to end federal protection of the right to abortion, which was made possible by the appointment of three conservative judges during his previous term. Since then, many conservative states have moved to ban or severely limit access to abortion. This is not the first time Trump has granted clemency to a large group of people; on January 20, he pardoned over 1,500 participants in the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 02:30 PM\nSource:[internazionale.it](https://www.internazionale.it/ultime-notizie/2025/01/24/usa-trump-grazia-attivisti-anti-aborto)\n\n**The Power of Pardons (to Distract)**\nDonald Trump's January 6 pardon spree, which granted clemency to over 1,000 individuals, including those involved in the Capitol riot, has overshadowed a series of significant policy changes initiated through executive orders. These orders, which have the potential to impact immigration enforcement, domestic energy production, and national security, have been met with lawsuits challenging their constitutionality. The fate of these policies will be determined in the courts, with intermediate rulings expected to presage the ultimate fate of the policies. Trump's use of executive orders has been unprecedented, with 220 issued during his first term and 26 on his first inauguration day. While executive orders have their limits, they can have a significant impact on policy and have been used by previous presidents to create sweeping policy initiatives, such as Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. However, Trump's orders have been met with criticism, and the coming legal fights over them will be consequential. As Elie Honig notes, 'History will remember the January 6 pardons. But that history is already made. The executive orders aren't as sensational as the release of hundreds of convicted Capitol rioters. But the coming legal fights over those orders will be even more consequential.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[NYMag](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-pardons-are-a-distraction-from-his-executive-orders.html)\n\n**President Donald Trump Signs Pardons for 23 Pro-Life Americans**\nPresident Donald Trump has signed executive orders pardoning 23 pro-life Americans who were imprisoned by the Biden administration for protesting abortion. The pardons were requested by the Thomas More Society, a legal organization that has been advocating for the release of these individuals. The group argued that the Biden administration had misused the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act to target peaceful pro-life activists, and that the prosecutions were unjust and violated the Supreme Court's ruling in Fischer v. U.S. (2024). The pardoned individuals include Joan Bell, Coleman Boyd, Joel Curry, and 19 others, who were convicted of minor trespassing misdemeanors. Trump had pledged to grant clemency to pro-life prisoners of conscience during his 2023 Pray Vote Stand Summit speech. The Biden-Harris administration has not prosecuted anyone under the FACE Act for the 436 church attacks that took place last year, despite pro-life pregnancy resource centers being 22 times more likely to be attacked than abortion facilities. 'Today, freedom rings in our great nation,' said Steve Crampton, Thomas More Society Senior Counsel. 'The heroic peaceful pro-lifers unjustly imprisoned by Biden\u2019s Justice Department will now be freed and able to return home to their families.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 04:57 PM\nSource:[lifenews.com](https://www.lifenews.com/2025/01/23/president-donald-trump-pardons-23-pro-life-americans-biden-imprisoned/)\n\n**Trump's Executive Orders: A New Era for the US**\nUS President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders to implement his 'America First' agenda, revoking 78 of Joe Biden's executive orders. Trump has withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Paris Climate Agreement, and has also announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada starting February 1. Additionally, Trump has granted clemency to 1,500 individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot, including Enrique Tarrio and Stewart Rhodes. Other notable executive orders include the delay of the ban on TikTok, the recognition of only two genders, and the revocation of targets for electric vehicles. Trump has also declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, authorized the designation of drug cartels as 'foreign terrorist organizations', and reinstated the death penalty for federal crimes. Furthermore, Trump has suspended foreign aid programs for 90 days and revoked the executive order on artificial intelligence. \nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 09:12 PM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/it/attualita/estero/usa-dalla-minimum-tax-alla-pena-di-morte-i-decreti-di-trump-2529853.html)\n\n**Trump Signs Over 40 Executive Orders on First Day in Office, Sets Record**\nOn his first day in office, US President Donald Trump signed over 40 executive orders, pushing forward his policies on immigration, trade, energy and climate change, government efficiency, and TikTok. According to US media, Trump set a record for the most executive orders signed by a US president on their first day in office. Trump signed 8 executive orders in the afternoon, including one that revoked nearly 80 executive orders and memoranda signed by his predecessor Joe Biden. He also signed other important executive orders, such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Agreement on climate change, exiting the World Health Organization, giving TikTok a 75-day grace period to sell or face a ban, and abolishing the 'birthright citizenship' for children born to undocumented immigrants or temporary residents in the US. Additionally, Trump declared a national emergency on the southern border, renamed the Gulf of Mexico to the 'American Gulf', granted clemency to around 1,500 individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol riot, and declared a national energy emergency. Trump also terminated the 'green new deal' of the Biden administration and required federal employees to return to the office, froze federal hiring, and protected free speech on social media. Furthermore, Trump considered imposing a 25% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada starting from February 1. In a statement, Trump said, 'Greenland is a beautiful place.

In the field of justice, Trump has granted clemency to approximately 1,500 people involved in the January 6, 2021, US Capitol assault, including Enrique Tarrio, leader of the Proud Boys, sentenced to 22 years in prison. On the immigration front, the President declared a national emergency at the US-Mexico border, authorizing the use of Pentagon resources and personnel to build the border wall. He also announced his intention to end birthright citizenship, modifying the ius soli. Regarding energy policy, Trump declared a national emergency to increase oil production in Alaska, relaxing environmental regulations and emissions limits. In the workplace, the President ordered federal employees to return to in-person work five days a week, ending remote work arrangements adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic. He also reinstated the 'Schedule F' classification, reducing protections for mid-level federal employees, making it easier to replace them with people aligned with his political agenda.

Trump has repeatedly downplayed the severity of the January 6, 2021, event, describing it as a 'day of love' and 'overflowing affection' towards him.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 05:50 AM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/international/amerique-nord/etats-unis/donald-trump-gracie-plus-de-1-500-assaillants-du-capitole-qualifies-d-otages_AD-202501210085.html)\n\n**Trump Signs Executive Order Granting Clemency to Capitol Hill Riot Participants**\nUS President Trump signed an executive order on January 20, 2025, granting clemency to approximately 1,500 individuals involved in the 'Capitol Hill riot' and reducing sentences for 14 others. Trump instructed the Attorney General to immediately implement the executive order, ensuring the release of those in custody. According to US media, those granted clemency include riot participants charged with inciting a rebellion and assaulting police officers. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, called Trump's actions 'shameful' and 'a blatant insult to the judicial system.' Trump had previously claimed that the 2020 presidential election was marred by 'massive fraud' and had promised to pardon riot participants on his first day in office. On January 6, 2021, a large group of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, disrupting a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's presidential election victory. The riot resulted in five deaths, numerous police injuries, and significant property damage. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 05:24 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202501213303304247.html)\n\n**Trump Grants Clemency to 1,500 Capitol Storming Participants**\nUS President Trump signed an executive order granting clemency to approximately 1,500 participants of the January 6, 2021, storming of the US Capitol. Trump expressed hope that they would be released from prison soon. 'We hope they will be released today. Honestly, they are waiting for it. Around 1,500 people,' Trump said. The storming of the Capitol was an attempt by Trump's supporters to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, which were won by Democrat Joe Biden. During the chaos, a protester was fatally shot by police, and several others died in unrelated incidents, classified as medical emergencies. A Capitol Police officer also died in the aftermath. In November, a DC court dismissed the case against Trump related to the Capitol storming, citing that charges against the US President could only be brought after he leaves office.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[vesti.ru](https://www.vesti.ru/article/4318710)\n\n",
