The election will be a short and intense campaign, with the recent knife attack in Aschaffenburg adding a new dimension to the debate. The TV debate on February 9 will focus on various topics, including migration policy. The election will determine who will represent the interests of citizens in the Bundestag. With the reform of the electoral law in 2023, the number of seats in the Bundestag will be reduced from 733 to 630. Currently, the following factions are represented in the Bundestag: CDU/CSU, SPD, the Greens, FDP, and AfD. The FDP is no longer part of the federal government after the removal of Finance Minister Christian Lindner. This means that the current government is a minority government.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:55 PM\nSource:[Augsburger Allgemeine](https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/politik/live-ticker-tv-duell-am-sonntagabend-die-debatte-zwischen-scholz-und-merz-103658792)\n\n**Germany's New Electoral Law: A Shift in Representation**\nThe German Bundestag has been discussing and debating a reform to the electoral law for years to prevent the parliament from continuously growing. The current Bundestag has 733 members, but the law requires 598 members. The discrepancy was caused by 'overhang mandates' and 'balance mandates'. The new electoral law, agreed upon by SPD, Greens, and FDP in 2023, sets the size of the Bundestag to 630 members and abolishes overhang and balance mandates. This means that a party's strength in the Bundestag will now be determined solely by their second vote results. A party will receive a number of seats proportional to their second vote share. Direct candidates will need to receive the 'second vote coverage' to be elected. If a party wins more direct mandates than their second vote share, only the candidates with the best results will be elected. This change may lead to situations where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency does not get elected. In some cases, a constituency may not be represented in the Bundestag at all. The CDU and CSU have announced that they will change the electoral law again after the next election, as they are opposed to the principle of second vote coverage. The current reform has been deemed compatible with the German constitution by the Federal Constitutional Court, but the court stopped the abolition of the 'basic mandate clause', which allowed parties to enter the Bundestag with at least three direct mandates and a vote share below 5%. 'We should consider that in the past, many voters have cast their first vote for a direct candidate of one party and their second vote for the list of another party,' said a spokesperson. 'This could lead to the desired direct candidate missing out on a seat in the Bundestag because their direct mandate is not covered by their party's second vote share.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 02:40 PM\nSource:[op-marburg.de / Oberhessische Presse / Zeitung f\u00fcr Marburg - Biedenkopf](https://www.op-marburg.de/politik/bundestagswahl-2025-was-sich-durch-das-neue-wahlrecht-aendert-6UKZT2XBPJGY3INNQR65ECMMUM.html)\n\n**The 2025 German Federal Election: How the Electoral Reform Could Change the Outcome**\nThe upcoming German federal election on February 23, 2025, is of great importance not only for Germany but also for Austria and the EU. The election will be influenced by the 2023 electoral reform, which introduced a maximum of 630 members in the Bundestag and abolished overhang and balancing mandates. This reform will change the way direct and proportional representation work. A candidate can win a direct mandate in a constituency but not enter the Bundestag if other direct candidates in their state perform better and the total number of seats is already allocated. This could have a significant impact on the election outcome. It is essential to inform voters about the new electoral law and its functioning, which will be a major challenge for all parties in the remaining weeks before the election.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 12:23 PM\nSource:[Opinion Leaders Network](https://www.leadersnet.at/news/86518,23-februar-2025-die-wahl-in-deutschland.html)\n\n**Bundestagswahl 2025: Germany fears the \u00d6sterreich-Szenario**\nThe upcoming 2025 German federal election is casting a shadow over the country. With the CDU's Friedrich Merz likely to win, the question remains: with whom can he form a government? The situation is reminiscent of Austria, where the far-right FP\u00d6 is currently in power. In Germany, the democratic parties are struggling to find common ground, with the SPD and Greens hardening their stance against Merz. The FDP is also struggling to reach the 5% threshold. Merz has ruled out cooperation with the far-right AfD, but they are likely to become the second-strongest force in the election. As a result, many are speculating about a possible \u00d6sterreich-Szenario (Austria scenario) in Germany, where a far-right party could become part of the government. However, other scenarios, such as a red-red-green coalition or a minority government, are also possible. Bundespr\u00e4sident Frank-Walter Steinmeier may play a crucial role in mediating the situation, as he did in 2017 when the Union and the SPD formed a grand coalition.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 11:52 AM\nSource:[Fuldaer Zeitung](https://www.fuldaerzeitung.de/politik-und-wirtschaft/bundestagswahl-2025-deutschland-fuerchtet-nun-das-oesterreich-szenario-zr-93561005.html)\n\n**Bundestagswahl 2025: Winners May Still Lose**\nIn the upcoming 2025 German federal election, a new rule may affect the outcome. If a party wins ten or more direct mandates in a district, but only ten of their candidates receive the most votes, the remaining district winners will not be able to enter the Bundestag. This is because the new 'second vote compensation' rule will come into effect. If a party has twelve district winners, for example, only the top ten will be elected, while the remaining two will be left out. This means that the district winners with the lowest first-round vote share will not be represented in the Bundestag. As explained by the new rule, 'the winners with the lowest first-round vote share will go empty-handed.' \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk](https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/deutschland/politik/neues-wahlrecht-bundestag-zweitstimmendeckung-folgen-fuer-linke-100.html)\n\n**Conservatives and Merz Considered Likely Winners in Upcoming German Elections**\nAccording to all German demoscopic institutes, the conservatives and their candidate Friedrich Merz are considered the likely winners of the upcoming general elections on February 23, 2024. 'Theoretically, anything can still happen, but everything indicates that Friedrich Merz will be the number one at the finish line,' said Stefan Merz, head analyst of the Infratest Dimap institute. The situation is much more stable, and the favorite's advantage is significantly greater than in the previous elections in 2021, according to the analyst. The conservatives are expected to win 30% of the votes, while the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has consolidated its second place with 21% of the votes. The governing Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Olaf Scholz is expected to receive 16% of the votes, its worst result in history, while The Greens are expected to receive between 14% and 15% of the votes. The three smaller parties with parliamentary representation are struggling to re-enter the Bundestag, with the Liberal Party (FDP) expected to lose its last seat with only 4% of the votes. The FDP and its leader, former Finance Minister Christian Lindner, are considered responsible for the early election in Germany. Friedrich Merz has publicly stated that voting for the FDP is equivalent to throwing away a vote, as they are unlikely to enter the Bundestag.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 11:09 PM\nSource:[Sur](https://www.diariosur.es/internacional/sondeos-dan-hecha-victoria-merz-alemania-20250209000201-nt.html)\n\n**German Bundestag Election 2025: Key Facts and Rules**\nThe German Bundestag election will take place on February 23, 2025, after the government coalition led by SPD, B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen, and FDP (the 'Ampel' coalition) broke apart. The election will follow the German electoral system, which includes 299 electoral districts, with voters having two votes: one for a direct candidate and one for a party list. The 'Zweitstimmendeckung' rule requires that a candidate's party must receive a sufficient number of second votes in the state to win the electoral district. The party list vote will determine the distribution of seats in the Bundestag. A party must receive at least 5% of the valid second votes to be considered for seat allocation. However, if a party wins at least three direct mandates, they will be allocated seats despite not meeting the 5% threshold. This exception was reinstated by the Federal Constitutional Court in 2024 and will remain in effect until the law is revised. The election will be held within 60 days of the Bundestag's dissolution, and the Bundespr\u00e4sident has set the election date for February 23, 2025.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:11 PM\nSource:[watson.ch/](https://www.watson.ch/!211435772)\n\n**Hesse's New Election Law Could Lead to Unprecedented Situation**\nThe new election law in Hesse, Germany, could lead to a situation where a winning candidate in a constituency does not receive a seat in the Bundestag, while three losing candidates do. This is because the law states that if a party wins more direct mandates than they are entitled to based on their second vote results, the candidates with the worst first vote results will not be elected. The CDU is the only party that could be affected by this rule. According to recent polls, the CDU could win 13 to 16 seats in Hesse based on their second vote results, but they are also likely to win most of the 22 constituencies in the state. This could lead to a situation where several direct candidates are in a tight competition. Yannick Schwander, the CDU candidate in the Frankfurt West constituency, is currently the favorite to win, but he may not receive a seat in the Bundestag if the CDU wins too many direct mandates.

Christina Stumpp (CDU) and Ingeborg Gr\u00e4\u00dfle (CDU) are likely to retain their seats, while Ricarda Lang (Greens) is almost certain to win a seat due to her high ranking on the party list. Lars Haise (AfD) and Ruben Rupp (AfD) may also win a seat depending on their party's performance.

Currently, Ataoglu is the frontrunner, with a chance to win the direct mandate for the CDU for the first time since 1957. Each voter has two votes: the first vote determines which direct candidate represents the respective electoral district in the Bundestag, while the second vote regulates the majority ratio of the parties in the Bundestag. Two of the candidates, Katrin Helling-Plahr (FDP) and Timo Schisanowski (SPD), are already members of the Bundestag and are seeking to defend their seats. Helling-Plahr has a promising position on the state list of her party and could potentially enter the Bundestag even if she does not win the direct mandate in Hagen, provided the FDP clears the 5% hurdle.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[wr.de](https://www.wr.de/lokales/hagen/article408235476/die-bundestagswahl-2025-und-die-kandidaten-in-hagen.html)\n\n**Understanding the Difference between First and Second Votes in the 2025 German Federal Election**\nIn the 2025 German federal election, voters will have two votes: the first vote (Erststimme) and the second vote (Zweitstimme). The first vote determines which candidate from the voter's electoral district will enter the Bundestag, while the second vote determines the overall distribution of seats among parties. The second vote is more important, as it regulates the majority in the Bundestag. According to the German electoral system, the number of seats a party receives is proportional to the number of second votes it receives. If a party wins more direct mandates than it is entitled to based on the second vote, the direct mandates with the lowest vote shares will be eliminated. The five percent hurdle requires parties to receive at least five percent of the second votes to enter the Bundestag. However, due to a court decision, parties with less than five percent of the second votes can still enter the Bundestag if they win the most first votes in at least three electoral districts. The order of the parties on the ballot papers varies across Germany, as each electoral district has its own unique ballot paper with different candidates. The order of the parties is determined by their performance in the previous federal election in the respective state, with parties that performed well in the previous election listed first. Other parties are listed in alphabetical order.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 11:58 AM\nSource:[Berliner Morgenpost](https://www.morgenpost.de/politik/article401539658/bundestagswahl-erststimme-zweitstimme-einfach-erklaert.html)\n\n**Germany's 2025 Federal Election: What You Need to Know**\nThe German federal election, also known as the Bundestagswahl, will take place on February 23, 2025. This is due to the collapse of the coalition government between the SPD, Greens, and FDP, which led to Chancellor Olaf Scholz submitting a vote of confidence in the Bundestag, which failed. The election will result in a new 630-member German Bundestag, a decrease of over 100 members from the current parliament. Voters will have two votes: one for a direct candidate in their constituency and one for a party. The party with the most second votes will determine the final seat distribution in the Bundestag. Eligible voters must be German citizens aged 18 or older, have lived in Germany for at least three months, and be registered in the voter register. Parties that have been represented in the Bundestag or a state parliament for at least five years will automatically appear on the ballot. Other candidates or parties must collect signatures to be allowed to participate. The SPD, Union, Greens, AfD, and BSW have announced their candidates for the election, including Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Friedrich Merz, Robert Habeck, Alice Weidel, and Sahra Wagenknecht. However, the FDP will not have a chancellor candidate.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 04:51 PM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswahl/termine-kanzlerkandidaten-parteien-alle-informationen-zur-bundestagswahl-2025_id_260520919.html)\n\n**Who will win the 2025 German elections? Polls show a fragmented landscape**\nGermany is preparing for federal elections to the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, on February 23, after the breakup of the coalition of social democrats (SPD), liberals (FDP), and greens (Die Gr\u00fcnen) that has led the country since 2021. The current Chancellor, social democrat Olaf Scholz, faces the elections at a time of enormous weakness and with the wind of polls in favor of the conservatives of the CDU, led by Christian democrat Friedrich Merz. The polls also predict the growth of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which may test the continuity of the 'cordon sanitaire' of the two major parties against the extreme right. According to the average of polls compiled by S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, the CDU has an 8-9 point lead over the SPD, with AfD in second place, five points ahead of the SPD, which is followed by the greens of Die Gr\u00fcnen, two points behind the social democrats. The trend of the last few days is that the CDU and SPD are giving ground to AfD and Die Gr\u00fcnen. The current coalition partner of Scholz would suffer some wear and tear compared to the 2021 elections, but nothing compared to the third partner, the liberals of the FDP, who could be surpassed even by Die Linke and by a new left-wing and pro-Russian populist brand, the BSW. The elections on February 23 will be governed by the new electoral law promoted by Scholz's government and partially overturned by the German Constitutional Court. One of the main changes is the reduction of the number of Bundestag seats from 736 to 630, which sets the majority needed to be invested as Chancellor at 316 deputies. The German electoral system is based on a double vote: with the first, the candidate of each of the 299 constituencies is elected, and with the second, which is a closed list vote, the number of parliamentarians each force will have is determined. If a party receives more deputies in a 'land' (state) through the first vote than it obtains through the second, an equivalent number of seats is added. After years of decline, the SPD recovered in 2021 and won by a narrow margin over the CDU, allowing Scholz to become Chancellor at the head of a 'semaphore' coalition of social democrats (SPD), liberals (FDP), and greens (Die Gr\u00fcnen). However, voter discontent has grown in parallel with the deterioration of Germany's economic situation, which is close to entering a recession. In contrast, the Christian Democrats, who in the last elections suffered the wear and tear of the 16 years of Angela Merkel's government, have managed to recover supported by Merz's moderate profile, who rejects any alliance with AfD. The ultras could give the 'sorpasso' to the SPD, but they lack real options to influence governance. The most plausible scenario reflected by the polls would be an alliance between the CDU, the SPD, and the greens of Die Gr\u00fcnen. On the other hand, the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) is at risk of falling below the 5% threshold necessary to ensure representation in the Bundestag. The German electoral system is highly proportional, so polls are a good photograph of the result that the urns may throw. A panorama that now shows a very fragmented hemicycle and long post-electoral negotiations before achieving a stable government. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 05:11 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/internacional/20250204/encuestas-elecciones-alemania-2025-quien-gana-113212941)\n\n**How the 2025 German Federal Election Works**\nIn Germany, there are 299 electoral districts, each with approximately 250,000 residents. Voters in each district cast their first vote to elect a representative, known as a direct candidate. The person with the most first votes in a district typically wins a seat in the Bundestag, but this is subject to the 'two-vote decking' rule, which is explained below. The second vote determines which party will receive seats in the Bundestag. The party with the most second votes in a district will receive a certain number of seats, but this can be adjusted based on the first votes. The two-vote decking rule ensures that a party cannot win more seats through first votes than they are entitled to based on their second vote performance. A party must receive at least 5% of the second votes nationwide to be represented in the Bundestag, unless they win at least three direct mandates through first votes, in which case they will receive seats based on their second vote performance. The number of seats in the Bundestag has been capped at 630 since the introduction of the new electoral law in June 2023.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 01:19 PM\nSource:[srf.ch](https://www.srf.ch/news/international/deutschland-wahlen-2025/erst-und-zweitstimmen-erklaert-so-funktioniert-die-wahl-fuer-den-deutschen-bundestag-2025)\n\n**2025 German Federal Election: What You Need to Know**\nIn the 2025 German federal election, voters will have two votes: the first vote (Erststimme) for a direct candidate in their local constituency, and the second vote (Zweitstimme) for a party.

This means that a candidate who wins the direct mandate in their constituency may not be elected to the Bundestag if their party does not win enough seats through the second vote.

The Bundestag is elected every four years, but in exceptional cases, such as this year, early elections are possible. All Germans aged 18 and above, except those who have been stripped of their voting rights by a court, are eligible to vote. In total, 59.2 million eligible voters have been registered for the election, which is less than the 61.2 million in 2021. The Chancellor is elected by the members of the Bundestag. The election will be affected by the electoral reform introduced by the coalition government, which includes the 'Zweitstimmendeckung' rule: parties will receive seats only according to their second vote results, even if not all district winners are elected. The goal is to reduce the number of Bundestag members from 736 to a maximum of 630. A 5% threshold applies to entering the Bundestag, meaning that a party must receive at least 5% of the total votes to receive a certain number of seats. Voters will receive a voting notification with date and location, and can cast their ballots in person or by mail. The first vote determines the winner of the electoral district, while the second vote decides how many seats a party will receive in the Bundestag.

The German Bundestag serves as the legislative body of the Federal Republic of Germany. The number of members in the Bundestag is not fixed and varies from election to election. According to Statista, the number of seats has been increasing over the past 20 years, with a record 736 members elected in 2021. Currently, the Bundestag has 733 seats. The Bundestag is composed of 598 members, consisting of 299 directly elected members in the electoral districts (first vote) and 299 members elected through the party lists (second vote). The exact difference between the first and second votes is explained in this article. The number of Bundestag seats changes with each election due to the complex German electoral system, resulting in a higher actual number of members than the statutory limit. This is due to the so-called overhang and balancing mandates. An overhang mandate occurs when a party wins more direct mandates in a federal state through the first vote than they would be entitled to through the second vote. This results in additional seats, increasing the total number of members. Balancing mandates ensure that the seat distribution in the Bundestag remains proportional to the distribution of second votes. They balance out the overhang mandates, preventing smaller parties from being disadvantaged. As a result, the number of seats continues to increase. A recent reform aims to limit the Bundestag to 630 seats by abolishing or limiting overhang and balancing mandates, thereby reducing the number of members. This reform, passed in March 2023, will come into effect for the next election, ensuring that the number of members will always be 630.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[kurier.at](https://kurier.at/politik/ausland/bundestagswahl-deutschland-wie-gross-anzahl-abgeordnete-sitze/402996509)\n\n**Bundestagswahl 2025 in Nuremberg-North: Candidates and Results**\nThe 2025 German federal election will take place on February 23, 2025. In the electoral district of Nuremberg-North (Wahlkreis 243), voters will be able to cast their ballots either in person or by mail. The current representative is Sebastian Brehm (CSU), who won the district in 2021 with 28.4% of the first votes. The main overview of the affiliated municipalities, candidates, and old and new results can be found below. The candidates for the 2025 election in the district are: Sebastian Brehm (CSU), Tessa Ganserer (Greens), and Gabriela Heinrich. The election will be the first to take place after the 2023 electoral reform, which has set the number of Bundestag members at 630 and abolished 'overhang and balancing mandates'. The distribution of seats will be based solely on the second votes, while direct mandates will only be relevant if they are supported by the second votes. The candidate who receives the most first votes in a district will secure the direct mandate and enter the Bundestag immediately, provided that their party has enough seats through the second votes. If a party wins more direct mandates than they are entitled to through the second votes, the direct mandates with the lowest vote shares will be forfeited. This phenomenon is known as 'second vote coverage', as explained by the federal government. With the second vote, voters do not choose a specific person, but rather influence the party list for their state. These lists contain the names of the candidates that the party wants to send to the Bundestag from their state. Direct mandates have priority when allocating seats in the Bundestag. Additional seats that a party is entitled to through the second votes will be filled by candidates from the state lists. To enter the Bundestag, parties must achieve at least 5% of the second votes nationwide or win three direct mandates through the first votes.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[infranken.de](https://www.infranken.de/lk/nuernberg/bundestagswahl-2025-im-wahlkreis-nuernberg-nord-einteilung-kandidaten-und-ergebnisse-art-6005268)\n\n**Bundestagswahl 2025: Everything you need to know about the election in the F\u00fcrth district**\nThe 2025 German federal election will take place on February 23, 2025. In the Bundestagswahlkreis F\u00fcrth (number 242), voters will be able to cast their ballots either in person or by mail. The current representative is Tobias Winkler (CSU), who won the district in 2021 with 37% of the first votes. According to the electoral reform of 2023, the number of Bundestag members has been fixed at 630. A significant change is that so-called 'overhang and balancing mandates' are now abolished. The distribution of seats will be based solely on the second votes, while direct mandates are only relevant if they are supported by the second votes. 'The second vote is used to determine the composition of the Bundestag,' explains the Federal Government. 'It is not a vote for a specific person, but rather an influence on the party list of a state.' The party lists contain the names of the candidates who the party wants to send to the Bundestag in the respective federal state. 'If a party wins more direct mandates than it is entitled to based on the second votes, the direct mandates with the lowest vote shares will be abolished,' the Federal Government explains. To enter the Bundestag, parties must achieve at least 5% of the second votes nationwide or win three direct mandates through the first vote.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[infranken.de](https://www.infranken.de/lk/fuerth/bundestagswahl-2025-im-wahlkreis-fuerth-einteilung-kandidaten-und-ergebnisse-art-6005248)\n\n**Understanding the Second Vote in the 2025 German Federal Election**\nAt the 2025 German federal election, voters will have two votes: the first vote and the second vote. The second vote, also known as the Zweitstimme, is crucial in determining the strength of each party in the Bundestag. It decides which candidates from each party will be elected to represent their respective states in the Bundestag. The second vote outcome will determine the majority in the parliament. The seats are allocated through a combination of upper and lower allocation: first, the number of seats each party is entitled to nationwide is calculated, and then these seats are distributed among the state lists. Additionally, there is a 5% hurdle: any party that wants to enter the Bundestag must win at least 5% of the second votes or three direct mandates. The reform also introduces a new rule: direct mandates only count if they are backed by second votes. If a party wins more direct mandates than they are entitled to based on second votes, the direct mandates with the lowest vote shares will be cancelled. This ensures that the seat allocation in the Bundestag remains proportional and is limited to a maximum of 630 seats.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 03:43 PM\nSource:[prosieben.de](https://www.prosieben.de/serien/newstime/news/was-waehlt-man-bei-der-bundestagswahl2025-mit-der-zweit-stimme-481945)\n\n**German Federal Election 2025: Key Facts and Dates**\nThe German federal election 2025 is scheduled to take place on February 23, 2025. Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost the confidence vote, paving the way for new elections. The main parties participating in the election are the SPD, CDU, B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen, FDP, AfD, and 'Die Linke'. The F\u00fcnf-Prozent-H\u00fcrde (five percent threshold) must be overcome to secure a seat in the Bundestag. However, the Grundmandatsklausel (basic mandate clause) allows parties to bypass this threshold if they win at least three direct mandates. The election will be held using the new electoral law, which reduces the number of Bundestag seats from 736 to 630. In North Rhine-Westphalia, there will be 64 electoral districts. The voting process will involve two votes: the first vote for the candidate in the electoral district, and the second vote for the party list. The party with the most votes in the second vote will receive the most seats in the Bundestag. The election will also feature several new parties, including the B\u00fcndnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW). The voting age is 18, and citizens must have been resident in Germany for at least three months to be eligible to vote. The election will be held using a mixed-member proportional representation system. The exact dates for the election and the deadline for postal voting are not yet known. The election will be an important test for the German political landscape, and the outcome will have significant implications for the country's future.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 22, 2024 07:54 PM\nSource:[wa.de](https://www.wa.de/nordrhein-westfalen/stimmzettel-bundestagswahl-2025-nrw-was-waehler-wissen-muessen-parteien-datum-93482233.html)\n\n",
