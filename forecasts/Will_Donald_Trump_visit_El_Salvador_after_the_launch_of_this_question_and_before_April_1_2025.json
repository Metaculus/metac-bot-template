The space agency has announced that the SpaceX Crew-10 launch, which was previously scheduled for 25 March, will now take place on 12 March, pending mission readiness and certification. This change will save at least a couple of weeks from the original schedule, said NASA's commercial crew programme manager Steve Stich. As a result, Williams and Wilmore could be back on Earth by mid-March instead of the late March or April window previously planned. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk had previously stated that US President Donald Trump had asked him to bring the two NASA astronauts back as soon as possible.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 08:47 AM\nSource:[IndiaTimes](https://www.indiatimes.com/news/world/sunita-williams-butch-wilmore-could-return-to-earth-by-mid-march-says-nasa-652588.html)\n\n**US Senator Ossoff Urges Trump Administration to Reject El Salvador's Prison Proposal**\nUS Senator Jon Ossoff has urged the Trump administration to immediately reject President Nayib Bukele's proposal to transfer US citizens and lawful residents convicted of crimes to prisons in El Salvador, warning that it would violate constitutional rights and expose inmates to 'dangerous and inhumane' conditions. Ossoff, in a letter dated February 10, 2025, to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pam Bondi, described the administration's stance as 'disturbing' and cited federal law that prohibits the deportation of US citizens, citing the 1922 Supreme Court case Ng Fung Ho v. White. He also highlighted the severe and dangerous conditions in Salvadoran prisons, described by the State Department as 'severe and dangerous', with overcrowding, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, and health risks. Ossoff argued that accepting the proposal would be a 'moral and legal travesty', violating the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment, citing cases such as Brown v. Plata (2011), where the Supreme Court ruled that 'prisoners retain human dignity' and demanded minimum prison conditions. 'Even considering this option undermines fundamental ethical and legal principles,' Ossoff wrote, urging a 'quick response' from the administration. The proposal has been met with criticism from human rights organizations, which have denounced torture and deaths in Salvadoran prisons. The Trump administration has not publicly responded to the letter.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[elsalvador.com](https://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/internacional/nayib-bukele-marcos-rubio-carceles-estados-unidos-detenidos-/1199786/2025/)\n\n**Reader Opinions on Various Topics**\nSeveral readers shared their opinions on various topics in the 'Foro' section of La Naci\u00f3n. Victor Guevara Ram\u00edrez expressed concern about the treatment of animals during the Fiestas C\u00edvicas 2025 in Nicoya, Guanacaste, where he saw children riding horses without proper supervision and horses being subjected to cruel treatment with spiked spurs. He suggested that organizers take steps to prevent accidents. Paulo Emilio Gonz\u00e1lez criticized the lack of action from the education unions in the face of the current state of education in Costa Rica, which he attributes to the incompetence of the former Minister of Education. Yamileth Chaverri Salazar also expressed her disappointment with the education system and the lack of action from the unions. Freddy Pacheco Le\u00f3n discussed the economic situation in El Salvador, which he attributes to the 'Bukele model', and the high levels of poverty and food insecurity in the country. Dennis Fitzgerald warned about the dangers of Donald Trump's plan to take control of the Gaza Strip and deport the Palestinian people, comparing it to the treatment of indigenous Australians. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 02:56 AM\nSource:[La Naci\u00f3n, Grupo Naci\u00f3n](https://www.nacion.com/opinion/cartas/fiestas-en-nicoya/O444DQ4ZGZFKHBDSU5J2BUXORY/story/)\n\n**FMLN Leader Predicts Party's Revival in El Salvador Amidst Economic and Environmental Concerns**\nFMLN leader, Flores, predicts a revival of the party in El Salvador.

Flores expressed concerns about the reestablishment of metallic mining and the economic situation, which is affected by the increase in the price of the basic food basket. He stated that the people are ready to defend 'life and water' and that the country will have to import more than 40 percent of the food consumed by the population in the coming months. Flores also mentioned that the people have lost their fear and are protesting, demanding more. He criticized the government, saying that President Bukele is losing popularity and support, despite a Gallup poll showing high approval ratings. Flores also made comments on US foreign policy, stating that President Trump believes he is 'the king of the world' and is poorly advised by his entourage. He noted that during the visit of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, no president talked about defending the rights of immigrants, highlighting the authorities' priority on the issue.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 09:21 PM\nSource:[plenglish.com](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/02/11/fmln-leader-predicts-partys-revival-in-el-salvador/)\n\n**Ossoff calls on Trump admin to 'publicly refuse' El Salvador's offer to jail Americans**\nGeorgia Sen. Jon Ossoff is urging the Trump administration to reject El Salvador's offer to hold American citizens in its prison system, citing concerns over life-threatening and abusive conditions. Ossoff's letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pam Bondi comes after President Donald Trump expressed interest in the proposal, saying he would jail Americans in El Salvador 'in a heartbeat' if he had the legal right to do it. Ossoff wrote, 'Federal law does not allow the deportation of U.S. citizens, and El Salvador's prisons are internationally notorious for life-threatening and abusive conditions.' He added, 'It would be a moral and legal travesty for the U.S. government to subject anyone to such conditions.' The proposal has been met with concerns from lawyers and advocates, but was praised by top Trump administration officials, including Elon Musk and Rubio, who called it a 'very generous offer'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:51 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/ossoff-calls-trump-admin-publicly-104017570.html)\n\n**US 2024-2025: A New Era of Economic and Political Changes**\nThe new government of the United States, led by Donald Trump, has made significant changes in its economic and political policies, affecting many nations. One of the key agreements is with Mexico, where 10,000 soldiers will be stationed on the northern border to prevent drug and migrant trafficking. With Canada, an agreement was made to prevent fentanyl access through the northern border. These agreements are under the threat of a 25% tariff on all exports to the United States if not met. Trump has also implemented a 10% tariff on China and has pressured Panama to cancel its economic agreement with China. Colombia has agreed to transport deportees to the United States, avoiding tariffs and visa pauses. Venezuela has accepted deportees and criminals from the Tren de Arag\u00fca. Costa Rica will help combat narco-trafficking and has allied with the United States against China. Argentina has left the World Health Organization (WHO) and prohibited sex change treatments for minors. Guatemala has agreed to accept deportees from other nations. The Salvadoran government has offered a mega-prison for US criminals and migrants. This is the influence and tough stance of the new US government. The US trade deficit with China was $295.401 billion, with Mexico $171.809 billion, and with Canada $63.335 billion. Comparing 2023 to 2024, Mexico's exports to the US grew by 3.5% and the surplus by 12.6%. Chinese exports to the US grew by 2% and had a commercial surplus of 5.8%. The US bought $3 trillion 267 billion and sold $2 trillion 065 billion in international trade in 2024, resulting in a $1 trillion 202.217 billion trade deficit. China is the main commercial enemy to be defeated. The main US trade partners are Mexico, Canada, China, Germany, and Japan. The US government has announced a possible 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, mainly from Canada (23%), Brazil (15.6%), Mexico (12.6%), South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, Germany, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and China. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the US to negotiate economic agreements, as India is the world's most populous country with 1.450 billion inhabitants. The economic power of this nation has been managed differently in the last three weeks, and these strict economic measures will change the face of international trade.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[pulsoslp.com.mx](https://pulsoslp.com.mx/opinion/estados-unidos-2024-2025/1897513)\n\n**Venezuelan planes sent to US for deportation flights return to country with nearly 200 deportees**\nTwo planes sent by Venezuela returned home on Monday with nearly 200 Venezuelans who were in the U.S. illegally as part of President Donald Trump's mass deportation plan. According to Richard Grennell, Trump's envoy, 'Two planes of illegal immigrants left El Paso today headed to Venezuela - paid for by the Venezuelans.' This marks a possible ease in tensions between the two countries and a win for the Trump administration as it seeks to have countries take back their citizens found in the U.S. without authorization. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said, 'This is the world we want, a world of peace, understanding, dialogue and cooperation.' The deportation flights come after Grennell visited Caracas a few weeks ago and after the Trump administration reached agreements with El Salvador and Guatemala for those countries to accept their citizens and U.S. deportees of other nationalities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 06:25 AM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/world/venezuelan-planes-sent-us-deportation-flights-return-country-nearly-200-deportees)\n\n**El Samaritano Shelter Sees Decrease in Migrant Visits After US Government Measures**\nThe El Samaritano shelter in Bojay has seen a decrease in visits from migrants, mainly from Latin America, since the new US government measures were implemented. Volunteers Mar\u00eda Elena Cruz and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda, who attend the shelter on Thursdays, shared with La Silla Rota that they did not receive any migrants on January 27, 28, and 29. They attribute this to the measures adopted by Donald Trump, stating that while some migrants are willing to risk everything to cross into the US, others are now hesitant. The shelter receives migrants from various countries, including Honduras, Colombia, El Salvador, Venezuela, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, often traveling alone or with their families. Mar\u00eda Elena commented, 'I tell them not to try to cross here, but to go where the train is slower, because it's dangerous and they can lose a limb.' The shelter provides food, a place to change clothes, bathe, and rest, but does not allow migrants to stay overnight due to security concerns. Despite the decrease in migrants, the shelter continues to offer assistance, including clean clothes, food, and a hot shower. Migrants often leave behind drawings and messages of gratitude, including a note from a Polish person that reads, 'Dios siempre est\u00e1 con nosotros' (God is always with us).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 02:08 AM\nSource:[La Silla Rota](https://lasillarota.com/hidalgo/reportajes/2025/2/10/albergue-de-bojay-migrantes-frenan-su-paso-tras-medidas-de-trump-522536.html)\n\n**Lock Clicks Behind Marco Rubio During Tour Of Salvadoran Prison Cell**\nDuring a tour of a prison in El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio became trapped in a cell after hearing the click of a lock behind him. Rubio, reportedly panicked, exclaimed, 'Uh, guys, I think there's been some kind of misunderstanding -- I'm here on a diplomatic visit, not because I'm a criminal.' He then laughed and called for a prison guard, attempting to explain that he was looking for a prison to lock people up in, not to be locked up himself. Rubio demanded to be released, stating that President Trump was waiting for him back in the U.S. and would come looking for him if he wasn't let out. However, sources confirmed that Rubio was left shouting for help and desperately pulling at the steel bars, only to find his cellmate grinning and sharpening a toothbrush shiv. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[The Onion](https://theonion.com/lock-clicks-behind-marco-rubio-during-tour-of-salvadoran-prison-cell/)\n\n**Latin American Countries Try to Charm Trump with Immigration Deals**\nSome Latin American countries are trying to charm US President Donald Trump into making bilateral agreements with the United States, including El Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele offered to receive migrants or Americans who have committed crimes on American soil and include them in the largest prison in Latin America, according to El Salvador's newspaper. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Salvadoran President Bukele announced an 'unprecedented' agreement on immigration that includes the deportation of undocumented migrants from any nationality to El Salvador who have committed crimes on American soil. Bukele also offered to receive 'dangerous American criminals' and sparked alarm among human rights organizations. According to Rubio, El Salvador will accept 'the deportation of foreigners who are undocumented in the United States and are criminals of any nationality, whether they are from MS-13 or Trinitarios', and in addition, the newly appointed foreign minister mentioned that Bukele himself offered to receive not only detained and deported migrants, but also 'the reception of American dangerous criminals in its prisons', even if they are legal in the country located in North America or hold citizenship. El Salvador currently has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with 1086 people in prison per 100,000 inhabitants, and the president himself boasted of opening the largest prison in Latin America in 2022, which holds over 25,000 inmates. In a speech led by the need to eliminate crime in the country, the reality is that the militarization of the country has been paid for by issuing debts and drowning the economy in paying the International Monetary Fund and other banks, and last year, the government's policies in El Salvador led to a debt of $30 billion, in an economy that has been converted to foreign currencies since 2000, and its foreign debt in 2023 represents 84.68% of the country's GDP. The Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Guatemalan President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo told US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that he would increase the number of flights for deported migrants coming from Guatemala and receive people from other nationalities. This agreement came during Rubio's visit to Guatemala last week, the fourth stop in his first official trip as US Secretary of State for President Donald Trump, which took him to other countries in Central America and the Caribbean region. Ar\u00e9valo said in a joint press conference held at the National Palace of Culture in Guatemala City: 'We agreed to increase the number of flights for people being deported by 40%, whether they are returning citizens or people from other nationalities to return to their homelands later.' The president said that details of this process will be discussed in bilateral working groups, which will begin with meetings in Washington in the coming days. Costa Rica will also cooperate with the United States in combating drug trafficking, as the government of Rodrigo Ch\u00e1vez is facing a wave of crime related to drug trafficking. US Secretary of State described Costa Rica as an old ally, a 'model' nation for the way its citizens live, but acknowledged the gravity of the problem facing Costa Rica due to the violent crime related to drug trafficking, which caused a record number of homicides in 2023 and a slight decrease in 2024, with great pressure on the police forces in this country that lacks an army.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 02:40 PM\nSource:[youm7.com](https://www.youm7.com/story/2025/2/10/%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%BA%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%81%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA/6878805)\n\n**US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Visits El Salvador to Counter China's Influence**\nUS Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, met with El Salvador's President, Nayib Bukele, on February 3, 2024, to discuss strategies to counter China's influence in the region. According to the US Department of State's spokesperson, Tammy Bruce, Pompeo emphasized the need to 'contrarrestar la influencia del Partido Comunista Chino' in the hemisphere to protect the sovereignty and interests of both nations and the region. El Salvador has maintained diplomatic relations with China since 2018, established by the government of former President Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n. The two countries have signed several cooperation agreements, including the construction of the National Stadium, the National Library, and a water treatment plant. US officials, under Trump, have been working to undermine these advances, using various tools to do so. The visit also rekindled the debate on migration, deportations, and the return of the 'third country safe' agreement. Analysts believe that the US will maintain its hardline policy against immigrants, but it will not be effective if Washington does not support and contribute to internal development initiatives to improve employment and economies in the region.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 03:15 AM\nSource:[prensa-latina.cu](https://publica.prensa-latina.cu/pub/el-salvador-el-halcon-rubio-y-los-temores-de-eeuu-sobre-china)\n\n**El Salvador's Capacity to Receive Undocumented Migrants Questioned**\nA recent online survey by La Prensa Gr\u00e1fica found that 88% of nearly 700 respondents do not believe El Salvador has the necessary conditions to receive undocumented migrants, while 12% think it does. According to President Donald Trump, 'we don't want this people in our country. We don't want them in our country. If we had the option, if we had the option to remove them and leave them settled in another country at a fraction of the cost', he explained in reference to a proposal by Nayib Bukele. The 'third country safe' agreement is a plan that allows Washington to deport migrants to other countries for them to seek asylum. The goal of this agreement is to reduce the number of people who can request asylum in the United States. The Trump administration signed agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in 2019, but the Biden administration suspended them. Critics argue that the countries receiving migrants are not considered safe. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's recent visit to the region aimed to revive these plans, which critics like FMLN Secretary General Manuel Flores say will turn El Salvador into 'a dumping ground and trash can for Americans'. Rubio's visit has been marked by constant references to the migration issue, where he is able to 'twist the arm' of local leaders with threats. In the case of Salvadorans, it is clear that the country has a significant dependence on the United States, with nearly three million Salvadorans living there, both legally and undocumented. The country receives almost a quarter of its GDP from remittances, which exceeded $8.4 billion in 2024, with over 90% coming from the United States. Additionally, at least 234,000 nationals are protected from deportation by a TPS (Temporary Protected Status) that can be revoked by the current administration, although El Salvador's ambassador to the White House, Milena Mayorga, said there is no news of termination. While Trump promised to curb migration and even canceled TPS for Venezuelans, there is no news of termination for Salvadorans in the United States.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 05:34 AM\nSource:[prensa-latina.cu](https://www.prensa-latina.cu/2025/02/05/encuesta-pone-en-duda-capacidad-de-el-salvador/)\n\n**US Secretary of State Marco Rubio Visits El Salvador**\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited El Salvador, where he was received by the country's Foreign Minister, Alexandra Hill Tinoco, and other officials.

According to sources, Rubio met privately with President Nayib Bukele and Foreign Minister Hill Tinoco as part of his agenda.

Rubio had praised Bukele's security policies during a visit to El Salvador in 2023, and this visit aims to strengthen the strategic alliance between El Salvador and the US, as well as set a joint work agenda between Bukele and US President Donald Trump.

The visit is expected to strengthen the relationship between the government of President Nayib Bukele and the Republican Party in Washington, according to analysts. Rubio has a history of supporting Bukele's security policies, particularly the fight against gangs through the state of exception. El Salvador accepted the 'third country safe' agreement during the Trump administration, which required migrants passing through Salvadoran territory to seek asylum in the country before reaching the US border. With Rubio as Secretary of State, analysts suggest that this agreement could be reactivated, raising several questions. What role will El Salvador play in Trump's mass deportation plan? Will the country receive deported migrants, including members of the Tren de Aragua gang? Will there be space for economic development initiatives or will the visit focus solely on tightening migration control? Experts say that Rubio's visit will primarily reinforce the ideological alignment between Trump and Bukele. 'They will confirm the relationships and principles they share ideologically,' said Oscar Picardo Joao, a researcher at the Universidad Francisco Gavidia in San Salvador. 'Trump and Bukele coincide on several points, especially in foreign policy and ideology.' The researcher also notes the possibility of the US proposing that El Salvador once again become a 'third country safe'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 11:44 AM\nSource:[lajornadanet.com](https://lajornadanet.com/portada/lo-que-se-espera-de-cara-a-la-llegada-de-rubio-a-el-salvador-para-reunirse-con-bukele/)\n\n**US Secretary of State Marco Rubio Arrives in El Salvador for Regional Meetings**\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in El Salvador today at the International Monse\u00f1or \u00d3scar Arnulfo Romero Airport, where he was received by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alexandra Hill Tinoco, the Ambassador Milena Mayorga, and the US Ambassador to El Salvador, William Duncan.

Rubio came to San Salvador from Panama, where he met with President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino and visited the Panama Canal, amidst controversy in the Central American country over President Donald Trump's statements on his intention to retake control of the interoceanic route. This is not Rubio's first visit to El Salvador. In March 2023, when he was still a senator from Florida, he met with President Bukele and praised his security policies, while criticizing the Biden administration's distancing from the Central American nation.

Under the agreement, the US would deport migrants from other nations to El Salvador, where they would apply for asylum, rather than in the US. The plan also involves sending suspected members of the Venezuelan-based Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador, which Trump wants to designate as a 'terrorist organization'. Trump has accused the gang of crimes against Americans during the 2024 election campaign. The agreement could be signed during a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to El Salvador and Panama next week. El Salvador would take responsibility for deporting Nicaraguan and Cuban nationals, whose governments have refused to accept forced repatriations. Trump has expressed his desire to 'stop illegal migration and hit transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua', according to a statement. Bukele and Argentine President Javier Milei, who both attended Trump's inauguration, share an ideological affinity that could facilitate the agreement.

The plan also involves sending to El Salvador suspected members of the Venezuelan crime gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump wants to designate as a 'terrorist organization' and has linked to crimes against Americans during the 2024 election campaign. This agreement is similar to one negotiated by the Trump administration with El Salvador during his first term, but never implemented and rejected by the Biden government. Trump recently called El Salvador's President Bukele to discuss the need to 'stop illegal immigration and hit transnational gangs like Tren de Aragua.' US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will visit El Salvador and other Latin American countries next week.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[t13.cl](https://www.t13.cl/noticia/mundo/eeuu-negocia-salvador-recepcion-migrantes-otros-paises-27-1-2025)\n\n**Trump and Bukele Agree to Cooperate on Migration and Gangs in First Call of Second Term**\nUS President Donald Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele held their first phone call since Trump's second term began, agreeing to work together to combat illegal migration and transnational gangs. Trump praised Bukele as 'an example' for other Western Hemisphere countries, highlighting his leadership in reducing violence in El Salvador. Bukele has implemented a state of exception since 2022, which has significantly reduced homicide rates in the country, but has been criticized by human rights organizations for severe restrictions on fundamental rights. Trump emphasized the importance of collaboration with countries like El Salvador to strengthen regional security. El Salvador has seen a historic drop in homicide rates since the state of exception began, but the regime has led to the detention of nearly 84,000 people, with 90% still awaiting trial. Bukele claims El Salvador is now 'the safest country in the Western Hemisphere.' The US and El Salvador will continue to strengthen their bilateral relationship, with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio set to visit El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and Panama in late January and early February.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[hispanicpost.com](https://hispanicpost.com/2025/01/24/trump-y-bukele-acuerdan-cooperacion-contra-migracion-ilegal-y-pandillas-en-su-primera-llamada-del-nuevo-mandato/)\n\n**Salvadoran President to Visit Russia to Discuss Bitcoin and Digital Infrastructure**\nAccording to sources, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele plans to visit Russia in 2025 to discuss various topics, including the use of Bitcoin. The exact date of the visit is unknown, and the agenda may be adjusted after the inauguration of the new US President, Donald Trump. The meeting is expected to focus on cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, with El Salvador potentially offering Russia cooperation in digital payments. Additionally, the two sides will discuss the development of digital infrastructure and nuclear energy. It is also possible that they will discuss steps to circumvent Western sanctions against Russia using digital assets.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 26, 2024 01:10 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/article-2609325)\n\n**El Salvador\u2019s Nayib Bukele To Visit Russia in 2025\u2014Bitcoin on the Agenda?**\nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele is reportedly planning a trip to Russia in 2025, with Bitcoin likely to be a key part of the discussion. The two countries could find common ground on Bitcoin as they explore alternate payment methods. However, the success of this visit will largely depend on the political landscape, especially the United States' stance on Russia under President-elect Donald Trump. Alexander Ilyukhin, the first secretary of the Russian Embassy in Nicaragua and head of the office in El Salvador, confirmed that discussions about the visit are ongoing, noting that U.S. policies will play a significant role. Both countries have shown interest in cryptocurrencies, with El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and Russia using it to navigate international sanctions in 2024. This shared interest could lead to an economic relationship based on the blockchain, bypassing traditional financial systems to support trade and innovation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 25, 2024 08:47 AM\nSource:[ccn.com](https://www.ccn.com/news/crypto/el-salvadors-nayib-bukele-visit-russia-2025-bitcoin-agenda/)\n\n**Salvadoran President Bukele May Visit Russia in 2025**\nThe possibility of a visit by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to Russia is being discussed.

Ilyukhin noted that the start of the presidency of Donald Trump could be a factor, as 'different negative details may arise unexpectedly.' This interest in a visit was first mentioned in June 2024, when Vice President of El Salvador Felix Ulloa expressed his country's willingness to welcome Russian President Vladimir Putin and also mentioned Bukele's interest in making a reciprocal visit.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 23, 2024 10:45 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1812696/2024-12-24/prezident-salvadora-bukele-mozet-posetit-rossiu-v-2025-godu)\n\n",
