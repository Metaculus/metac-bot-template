The budget aims to combat growing debt by slashing spending by 30 billion euros and increasing taxes by around 20 billion euros. Bayrou stated that these financial efforts are 'well-balanced', and that a prolonged period without a stable budget would have been 'very costly' for the country. Bayrou acknowledged that the budget is 'not perfect', but deemed its passage 'absolutely urgent'. A further confidence vote is already being considered.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 08:33 AM\nSource:[Die Presse](https://www.diepresse.com/19334080/frankreich-die-linke-volksfront-broeckelt)\n\n**French Prime Minister Bayrou Survives Motions of Censure, But Faces Uncertain Future**\nFrench Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has survived two motions of censure presented by the left-wing party La Francia Insumisa (LFI) after the approval of the 2025 state budget and the Social Security accounts without parliamentary vote. Bayrou, a centrist politician appointed by President Emmanuel Macron in December, used a controversial constitutional article to force the adoption of the 2025 budget without parliamentary vote. Although Bayrou has now approved the budget, it is unlikely to be the only challenge to his fragile administration in the coming months. 'The passive support of the socialists and the extreme right of Marine Le Pen to Bayrou will end once the 2025 budget is fully promulgated in the coming days,' said the Eurasia Group, which gives a 70% chance of the government 'falling in the coming months.' The leader of the RN, Jordan Bardella, stated that his party would not support the motion of censure, adding: 'although it is a bad budget... we need a budget.' 'We need to avoid uncertainty, because many of our fellow citizens... are very concerned about the possible long-term instability,' he declared. The socialist leader Olivier Faure expressed that his party decided not to vote to overthrow the government for the budget, as it would have only led to 'a more right-wing prime minister' or even 'the resignation of the head of state.' 'We have chosen to give France a budget,' he declared to the radio station France Inter.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 09:32 PM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/es/francia/20250205-francia-el-gobierno-de-bayrou-asegura-los-presupuestos-tras-sobrevivir-a-dos-mociones-de-censura)\n\n**French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou Survives Motions of No Confidence**\nFrench Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has survived two motions of no confidence, with only 128 lawmakers voting in favor of the main motion that would have brought down his government. Bayrou, who used the controversial Article 49.3 of the French Constitution to push through the 2025 budget and social security funding without a vote, has managed to split the left-wing opposition, unlike his predecessor Michel Barnier. The left-wing party La France Insoumise submitted the motions of no confidence, but the centrist Socialist Party (PS) of former President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande did not support them, citing the 'national interest' and the need to 'put France back to work.' PS leader Olivier Faure said, 'This does not mean that we will automatically continue to support Bayrou's government.' However, other left-wing politicians have expressed irritation, with Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon saying, 'The NFP now has one party less.' Bayrou has also made concessions to the PS, allowing the French budget deficit to rise to 5.4% this year, up from 5% under Barnier. The move is seen as a key factor in securing the PS's support for the budget.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 07:57 PM\nSource:[NRC](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2025/02/05/franse-regering-overleeft-moties-van-wantrouwen-nu-wel-a4882113)\n\n**Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou Secures First Victory with State Budget Approval**\nFrench Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has secured a first victory with the approval of the state budget in Parliament, thanks to the decision of the socialists not to approve a motion of censure. The motion, presented by the radical left party LFI, communists, and ecologists, was voted down by 128 deputies, including six socialists, while 289 votes were needed to oust the government. Bayrou, an ally of President Emmanuel Macron, will face another motion of censure, also presented by LFI, but it also lacks prospects of success. The budget aims to reduce the public deficit to 5.4% of GDP in 2025, almost double the European limit, with a contribution of 52 billion euros (313 billion reais). The government plans to make drastic cuts in public spending, combined with new revenues from a temporary increase in taxes on the most profitable companies and large fortunes. 'The decisions we have to make are difficult and painful, because this is not our budget,' said socialist leader Boris Vallaud to France Info, warning that 'stability is far from being guaranteed.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 07:20 PM\nSource:[Istoe dinheiro](https://istoedinheiro.com.br/franca-garante-seu-orcamento-sem-solucionar-crise-politica/)\n\n**French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou Confident of Surviving Second Vote of No Confidence**\nFrench Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou is confident that he will survive the second vote of no confidence in a month.

However, the Socialist Party, led by Olivier Faure, has announced that they will not support the vote of no confidence, saying 'we have decided to give a budget to France' and breaking with the left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP).

There is no perfect budget, but we have found a balance, we have fulfilled our duty, and the decision is in your hands.' If Bayrou survives the vote of no confidence, the 2025 budget will be automatically approved, according to Article 49.3 of the Constitution.

Bayrou has a long history of experience in politics, having served as education minister, justice minister, and high commissioner of planning. He has also run thrice for the presidency of France and earned the popular moniker of the 'third man' of French politics. The new Prime Minister faces a monumental crisis, including a budget deficit of 6.1% in 2024, which is expected to further exacerbate to 6.2% in 2025 and 6.7% in 2026. Moody's has downgraded France's sovereign credit rating, putting pressure on the nation's borrowing costs.

Bayrou, a 73-year-old politician, has been a close ally of Macron since his arrival at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace in 2017. He will be the fourth head of government this year and will replace the conservative Michel Barnier, nine days after the no-confidence vote that toppled his government, the shortest in the country since World War II. Bayrou has been a well-known figure in French politics for decades and his experience is seen as crucial in efforts to restore stability, as no party has a majority in the National Assembly. Macron promised last week to stay in office until the end of his term in 2027. The National Assembly voted down Barnier's government in a no-confidence motion on December 4, backed by left-wing and far-right groups, in a historic move in over half a century that paved the way for a new round of contacts. Macron opted to reach out to left-wing parties, excluding La France Insoumise, and dropped Marine Le Pen's National Rally, although it remains to be seen if the new government will be able to secure a minimum level of support among lawmakers and avoid future no-confidence motions. Olivier Faure, leader of the Socialist Party, who was considered a potential supporter, demanded during negotiations the appointment of a left-wing prime minister and ruled out supporting some of the names on the shortlist, including centrist Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou. 'The President of the Republic has appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou as Prime Minister and entrusted him with the task of forming a government,' said the French presidency in a statement, without providing further details. Bayrou is the sixth prime minister of Macron's mandate and faces the immediate challenge of forming a cabinet that can survive a no-confidence motion in a deeply divided parliament and debate a 2025 budget in an attempt to limit economic turbulence. The announcement came after Macron received Bayrou for almost two hours of talks on Friday. BFMTV reported that the talks with Bayrou had been 'tense.' It was expected that Barnier would hand over power to his successor in a ceremony late on Friday morning. Bayrou's candidacy has caused unease on the left, which is wary of continuing Macron's policies, and on the right, where Nicolas Sarkozy's influential former presidency is not liked. Besides Bayrou, other candidates for prime minister include former Socialist Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, Defense Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu, a loyal Macron supporter, and former Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Le Drian said on Thursday that he had rejected the position. 'I rejected it,' he told Le Penthievre, a regional weekly. 'In two and a half years, I will be 80 years old, it would not be a disaster.' Public opinion polls indicate that the public is fed up with the crisis, and more than two-thirds of respondents in a survey by Elabe published on Wednesday said they want politicians to reach an agreement to avoid toppling a new government. Each of Macron's prime ministers has been in office for less time successively, and there is no guarantee that the new prime minister will not follow this pattern. In a survey by IFOP, Le Pen obtained a 35% approval rating in the first round of a future presidential election, far ahead of any likely opponent. On a critical date, March 31, 2025, Le Pen faces the verdict in a trial for embezzlement of funds, which she denies. If she is found guilty, she could lose the opportunity to run in the 2027 election and, with it, her best chance so far of winning the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 12:14 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2024/12/13/emmanuel-macron-nombro-a-francois-bayrou-como-el-nuevo-primer-ministro-de-francia/)\n\n**Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou Appointed as New French Prime Minister**\nFran\u00e7ois Bayrou has been appointed as the new Prime Minister of France by President Emmanuel Macron, on December 13, 2024.

He succeeds Michel Barnier, who was ousted by a motion of censure from the National Assembly on December 4. Bayrou is the sixth Prime Minister designated by Macron, and the fourth during his second term, which began in 2022. As the former Minister of National Education (1993-1997), Bayrou will need to pass the 2025 budget without being targeted by a motion of censure. The France Insoumise party has already announced their intention to vote for censure against Bayrou, while the RN party has adopted a similar stance to that of Michel Barnier, promising not to censure Bayrou 'a priori'. Bayrou briefly joined Edouard Philippe's government in the spring of 2017 as Minister of Justice, but resigned after a month due to the Modem assistants scandal.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 12:12 PM\nSource:[RMC](https://rmc.bfmtv.com/actualites/politique/francois-bayrou-premier-ministre_DN-202412130518.html)\n\n**Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou Appointed as New Prime Minister of France**\nLess than three months after taking office, the executive of Michel Barnier was ousted by a censure motion that left the country without a budget for 2025. French President Emmanuel Macron has appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou as the new prime minister of France, following the collapse of the government and the resignation of conservative Michel Barnier. Bayrou, the founder and leader of the centrist party MoDem, was previously Minister of State and Justice under Macron. He becomes the fourth prime minister of France in 2024, after Elisabeth Borne, Gabriel Attal, and Michel Barnier. Macron accused the extreme left and right of forming an 'anti-republican front', saying 'They don't want to build. They're not thinking about you, about your lives. They only think about the presidential elections, to precipitate them, with cynicism and a desire for chaos.' Despite pressure to resign, Macron refused to step down, stating that he would remain in office 'until the end': 'The mandate that was democratically entrusted to me is for five years, and I will exercise it until the end.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 12:10 PM\nSource:[SAPO](https://www.sapo.pt/noticias/atualidade/francois-bayrou-e-o-novo-primeiro-ministro-de_675c1ee14e44be7e61bc1170)\n\n**Francois Bayrou Named As New French Prime Minister - News18**\nPresident Emmanuel Macron has appointed centrist leader Francois Bayrou as the new French Prime Minister, following the ousting of Michel Barnier's government in a no-confidence vote. Bayrou, 73, faces the daunting task of forming a government that can survive a no-confidence vote in a deeply divided parliament and thrash out a 2025 budget to limit economic turmoil. Macron has been confronted with the complex political equation that emerged from snap parliamentary elections this summer, and the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) had demanded that Macron appoint a prime minister from their ranks. Bayrou's appointment has raised hackles on the left and right, and there is no guarantee that the new premier will not follow the pattern of successive prime ministers serving less time in office. Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader, has not been part of the most recent talks and faces a critical moment in her embezzlement trial on March 31, 2025, which could impact her chances of winning the Elysee Palace in the 2027 elections.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 12:08 PM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/world/francois-bayrou-named-as-new-french-prime-minister-9155359.html)\n\n**Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou Appointed as New Prime Minister of France**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has appointed his centrist ally Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou as the new Prime Minister of France. Bayrou, 73, has a long history in politics, having run for president three times (2002, 2007, and 2012) and founded the centrist party MoDem in 2007. He was previously Minister of Justice but resigned due to an investigation into the misuse of EU funds by his party. Bayrou was cleared of the charges in January 2024. Since 2020, he has been the High Commissioner for Planning, a position created by Macron to develop long-term strategies for France in areas such as economy, technology, and environment. Bayrou becomes the fourth Prime Minister of France in 2024, following Elisabeth Borne, Gabriel Attal, and Michel Barnier, who was ousted last week after a vote of no confidence that left the country without a budget for 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 11:57 AM\nSource:[contacto.lu](https://www.contacto.lu/fronteiras/quem-e-francois-bayrou-o-novo-primeiro-ministro-de-franca/29677766.html)\n\n**Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou Appointed as New Prime Minister of France**\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron appointed Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, the leader of the 'Union for Democracy' party, as the new Prime Minister of France. Bayrou, a 73-year-old politician, has been a close ally of Macron since 2017 and has been considered a potential candidate for the position of Prime Minister on several occasions. Bayrou acknowledged the 'gravity of the situation' regarding the country's financial crisis, stating that 'I am aware of the difficulties that await us in the Himalayas, and the first of these difficulties is the budget'. His priority will be to restart the difficult process of drafting the 2025 budget, which has been stalled since the previous Prime Minister, Michel Barnier, was ousted. Bayrou will have to negotiate with various parties, including the 'National Rally' and the 'France Insoumise' parties, to secure their support for the government's policies, including the budget. The 'National Rally' party has announced that it will submit a motion of no-confidence against Bayrou's government, while the 'France Insoumise' party has stated that it will support the motion. The 'Green Party' has also announced that it will support the motion of no-confidence. Bayrou's appointment has been seen as a compromise between the different parties, and he has vowed to work towards finding a 'new path' to address the country's financial crisis.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[alayam24.com](https://www.alayam24.com/articles-544944.html)\n\n",
