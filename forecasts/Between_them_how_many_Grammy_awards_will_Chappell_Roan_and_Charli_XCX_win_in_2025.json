            "initial_reasoning": "To forecast how many Grammy awards Chappell Roan and Charli XCX will win collectively in 2025, we start by examining historical Grammy win rates for similarly nominated artists. Historically, artists with several nominations (between 5 and 10) tend to win 1-2 awards on average. Therefore, we initially estimate that '0 or 1' award is quite probable, '2 or 3' is also a viable possibility, but higher numbers ('4 or 5' or 'Greater than 5') are typically rarer. Such artists, unless dominating a genre or category, usually face strong competition. Based on past years' data, artists with more than six nominations still frequently win between 1 and 3 awards collectively.",
