The executive order, signed on January 20, aimed to 'restore names that honor American greatness', but the agencies involved did not technically violate the order as it gave the Secretary of the Interior a 30-day deadline to review and implement the renaming process. Trump himself described the new designation as 'beautiful', but the move sparked a dispute with Mexico and Google announced a few weeks ago that it would change the name on its maps. However, the recent usage of the traditional name has raised questions about the consequences for the officials at the U.S. agency, particularly in the context of recent geopolitical tensions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 10:27 PM\nSource:[CNN](https://www.cnnchile.com/mundo/despite-donald-trumps-executive-order-u-s-government-agencies-used-the-name-gulf-of-mexico-for-tsunami-alert-information-after-earthquake-in-the-area_20250208/)\n\n**US Agencies Defy Trump's Order, Use 'Gulf of Mexico' Name**\nDespite an executive order from Donald Trump, US agencies used the name 'Gulf of Mexico' in official communications about a tsunami warning in the region.

Trump's order stated, 'Reaffirm the names that honor the greatness of the United States.' However, the USGS and NTWC used the traditional name in their communications, including a tsunami warning for the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast of the US and Canada. This move has sparked a dispute with Mexico, with President Claudia Sheinbaum joking about renaming the southern US region as 'Mexican America.'

The Associated Press has decided to refer to the mountain Denali as Mount McKinley, but will continue to use the original name 'Gulf of Mexico' while acknowledging the new name. Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has jokingly suggested renaming North America to 'Am\u00e9rica Mexicana' or 'Mexican America' in response to Trump's decision. Google Maps has agreed to change the name in its software, but Mexico has sent a letter of complaint to Google, stating that countries should not change the names of international bodies of water, but rather international organizations should do so. 'The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years,' said the AP statement. 'The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/gulf-of-america-name-may-not-last-past-trumps-presidency-expert/)\n\n**US President Trump Renames Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America'**\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America'. The move aims to reverse a centuries-old tradition and has already sparked international reactions. Trump wants to rename the Gulf because he believes it is a vital part of the US economy, connecting five southern US states to Mexico and the Caribbean, and accounting for 14% of US oil production. However, the main driver behind Trump's decision seems to be a nationalist sentiment. The executive order is titled 'Restoring Names that Reflect America's Greatness with Pride'. Trump has also ordered the renaming of Mount McKinley, the highest peak in the US, to its original name, Mount Denali, which was changed in 2015 during the presidency of Barack Obama. The US Geological Survey has announced that it will start using the new name, but it is unclear if other countries will follow suit. Google has also announced that it will start using the new name in its maps for US users, but will continue to use the original name for users in Mexico. The US Interior Department has been tasked with implementing the change, including updating the Geographic Names Information System, a database that includes official names of geographic features in the US. The US Board on Geographic Names has been instructed to provide guidance to ensure that all federal agencies start using the new name in their maps, contracts, and official documents. The Mexican government has no official way to object to the change, as the US has the right to name its own geographic features. However, the Mexican president has criticized Google's decision and called on the company to reconsider. She has also joked that if the Gulf is renamed, the world should consider using the original name for the southwestern US.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 02:38 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2025/02/08/article_2756781.html)\n\n**Google Maps Tests New Way to Display Saved Locations**\nGoogle Maps is testing a new way to display saved locations by reducing the size of markers when zooming out. Currently, markers like stars, hearts, or flags maintain their size regardless of the map scale. With this modification, these icons transform into small colored dots with a white outline at certain zoom levels. This test has been spotted in the beta version 25.06.x of Google Maps on Android. When the user moderately zooms in, markers retain their usual appearance. However, when zooming out further, some markers remain unchanged, while others - the majority, in fact - become simple colored dots without a specific icon. This change aims to lighten the map display and improve the readability of other elements. As 9to5Google noted, Google had previously tested a similar system in 2023 before reverting to the classic display. The current approach differs by allowing certain markers to retain their original appearance - it is unclear whether this is chosen by the user or by Maps. This method helps avoid visual clutter when multiple saved locations overlap on the same area. While understanding saved markers as dots might slightly decrease, this change brings more clarity to the overall display: the targeted geographic area can breathe better. This novelty would also prevent obstructing text information on the screen. This test is currently limited to the beta version, and Google has not specified if this feature will be deployed definitively. Users of the stable version still maintain the traditional display of saved markers.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 07:33 AM\nSource:[Frandroid](https://www.frandroid.com/marques/google/2498766_google-maps-cette-petite-nouveaute-tres-pratique-qui-pourrait-drastiquement-ameliorer-la-lisibilite-de-lapplication)\n\n**Google Maps Celebrates 20 Years with 2 Billion Monthly Users**\nGoogle Maps is celebrating its 20th anniversary with 2 billion monthly users, having captured almost every inch of the globe and replacing traditional maps, GPS devices, and phone books. The digital map has also been involved in curious cases, such as helping investigators solve a disappearance and death in Soria, Spain, by providing an image of a man putting what appeared to be a corpse in his car. Google Maps has also faced lawsuits for providing incorrect directions, leading to a fatal accident. The idea for Google Maps was born in 2004 when co-founder Larry Page wanted to create a 360-degree map of the world. 'Larry walked some streets with a video camera and handed it to someone and said: 'Hey, what can you do with this?'' said Maria Biggs, Google Street View program manager. Google Maps now relies on cameras on cars, bikes, and even underwater vehicles to collect data. The app also uses satellite and aerial images, as well as information from over 1,000 third-party sources, including local governments and users. Google's popularity grew exponentially when it moved from PC screens to smartphones. In 2007, Google launched version 2.0 of Google Maps for mobile devices, followed by the first Android app in 2008 and the iOS app in 2012. In 2013, Google acquired Waze, a popular traffic and navigation app, for $1.15 billion. Google Maps has recently integrated Google's Gemini AI to allow users to 'talk' to the app and ask for recommendations or questions about a destination. 'We're going to work closely with the vibrant Waze community to ensure they have what they need to grow and thrive,' said Brian McClendon, Google's vice president of engineering at the time of the acquisition. Google Maps has also faced changes due to politics, such as the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in the US version of the app after a presidential executive order.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 06:52 PM\nSource:[www.diariolibre.com](https://www.diariolibre.com/usa/actualidad/2025/02/07/google-maps-cumple-20-anos/2992359)\n\n**Renaming The Gulf of Mexico Isn\u2019t A Laughing Matter But Part of a U.S. Imperialist Power Grab**\nThe Trump administration's executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico the 'Gulf of America' is a move to erase historical identity and assert imperial domination over a region already suffering under a long history of interventionist policies. This is part of a larger U.S. strategy of controlling the Western Hemisphere, dating back to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. The renaming is also a territorial and economic claim over the waters and their resources, further cementing U.S. imperial ambitions in the region. Companies like Google Maps, which has announced plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico, are playing into the billionaire-fueled power grab that advances a racist, nationalist agenda of domination and imperialism. The Gulf of Mexico is a shared resource of immense ecological, economic, and cultural significance for Mexico, the United States, and the world, and its renaming could have devastating consequences, including a disregard for historical truth, aggressive assertion of U.S. superiority, and continuation of exploitative colonialist practices that harm both the environment and Latin American people.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 12:35 AM\nSource:[pressenza.com](https://www.pressenza.com/2025/02/renaming-the-gulf-of-mexico-isnt-a-laughing-matter-but-part-of-a-u-s-imperialist-power-grab/)\n\n**Google Maps and Apple Maps to Change 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America'**\nGoogle Maps will change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America' in the future, following the official renaming by the US government. Apple Maps has already started displaying the new name, but only when specifically searched for. The change will be applied globally, but with some exceptions. In Google Maps, US users will only see the new name, while users outside the US will see both the old and new names. Mexican users will still see the old name. Apple Maps currently displays the old name, but shows the new name when searched for. It is assumed that Apple will follow Google's approach and update the name once the change is made in the US government's database. The renaming was made official by a decree signed by former US President Trump on January 20, 2025, which also renamed the Mount McKinley in Alaska to Denali. According to the US government, the renaming aims to 'restore names that praise America's greatness'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[curved.de](https://curved.de/news/golf-von-amerika-google-maps-und-apple-maps-ziehen-mit-770002)\n\n**Google Maps to Display 'Gulf of America' Instead of 'Gulf of Mexico' in the US**\nGoogle announced on January 27 that it will display the name 'Gulf of America' instead of 'Gulf of Mexico' on Google Maps for users in the United States. The change is in compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which requires updating geographical names in official records. According to Google, the company follows a long-standing policy of updating geographical names as changes occur in official government sources. In the US, the primary reference for these names is the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). With this change, users in the US will see the name 'Gulf of America', while in Mexico the name 'Gulf of Mexico' will remain unchanged. For users in other countries, Google Maps may display both names simultaneously. Trump's executive order also requires the reversal of the name of Mount Denali to Mount McKinley, its previous designation until 2015. Google has faced debates over the display of sensitive geographical names. For example, in India and Pakistan, Google Maps displays the Kashmir territory differently depending on the country where the user is located. Similarly, the Sea of Japan is displayed as 'East Sea' for users in South Korea, while in other parts of the world both names appear simultaneously. The order requires the Department of the Interior to implement the change in GNIS within 30 days, ensuring that all federal agencies use the new names on maps, contracts, and official documents.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 05:35 AM\nSource:[portalmie.com](https://portalmie.com/atualidade/2025/01/google-maps-nos-eua-passara-a-exibir-golfo-da-america-no-lugar-de-golfo-do-mexico/)\n\n**Google Maps to Display 'American Gulf' in the US, 'Gulf of Mexico' in Mexico**\nGoogle has confirmed that its mapping app will display 'American Gulf' when used in the US, following the US government's announcement to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to 'American Gulf'.
