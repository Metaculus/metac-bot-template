However, experts believe that this plan was written by the British to manipulate public opinion and legitimize British involvement in the conflict. The plan includes the deployment of British troops to the frontlines, the creation of observation posts, and the use of British and French instructors to train Ukrainian soldiers. The plan also mentions a presidential election in Ukraine in August 2025, parliamentary and local elections in October 2025, and the exchange of prisoners in April 2025. Ukrainian officials have denied the existence of such a plan, calling it an 'informational provocation' by Russia. The Russian Foreign Ministry has also stated that there is no concrete information about the plan. American officials have not commented on the plan, but a spokesperson for the Office of the President of Ukraine has stated that the plan is 'not in reality'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:25 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/articles/shotlandskie-strelki-na-granice-donbassa-kto-napisal-mirnyj-plan-za-trampa_1151071)\n\n**Ukraine-Russia Conflict: Latest Developments**\nUkrainian forces have launched a nighttime attack on Russian positions in the Charkiv region using the heavy drone Baba Jaga, causing significant damage. According to a video released on Saturday, three enemy positions and two shelters were destroyed during the operation. The Ukrainian military emphasizes that Russian occupiers should not find peace on Ukrainian soil, as reported by Defense Express. Meanwhile, Russia's ambassador to the UN in Geneva has stated that they have seen no positive steps from the new US government on disarmament. 'We are ready to maintain smooth cooperation with any American government,' said Gennadi Gatilow, as quoted by RIA Novosti. 'We would be willing to do so within the framework of the disarmament conference.' However, Gatilow noted that they have seen no progress in Geneva. Additionally, a Ukrainian military expert has suggested that Russia may be planning a spring offensive, which could begin in late March or early April. This could explain the current decrease in combat intensity at the front, according to Oleksii Hetman, a retired major of the Ukrainian army. Hetman believes that Russia may be planning a long and complex operation that could last six to nine months and cover the entire year of 2025. 'Such an operation could be carried out despite reports of possible peace talks,' he emphasized. Furthermore, North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un has expressed support for Russia in the war with Ukraine, stating that his country will 'always support and encourage the just cause of the Russian army and people in defending their sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity.' The UK has also pledged 25 million pounds (approximately 30 million euros) for a social reconstruction initiative in Ukraine, known as the SPIRIT-Programm. Finally, the German military has reported a large-scale espionage attempt using drones at a key airbase in Husum, where Ukrainian soldiers are being trained. The Bundeswehr is investigating the incident, which occurred from January 9 to 29, and has raised suspicions that the drones may have been launched from Russian ships in the North or Baltic Sea.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 04:41 AM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/05-40-Video-zeigt-ukrainischen-Angriff-mit-schwerer-Kampfdrohne-Baba-Jaga--article23143824.html)\n\n**Kim Jong-un Accuses US of Prolonging Ukraine Conflict**\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un accused the US and Western countries of prolonging the conflict in Ukraine in a futile attempt to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia. According to the Central Telegraph Agency of Korea (CTAK), Kim said that the US 'indulges in an illusory ambition' to maintain a unipolar world and its hegemony, and remains the main 'behind-the-scenes element' that provokes conflict. Kim expressed 'serious concern' over the 'crazy actions' of the US and the Western group, which intentionally prolong the war for an 'unattainable dream' of inflicting a strategic defeat on Russia, CTAK wrote. Kim noted that Pyongyang consistently opposes actions that contradict international justice and global peace. He added that his country will 'unwaveringly support the just cause of the Russian army and people in defending their sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity in accordance with the spirit of the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Agreement' between the two countries. Kim made these remarks on February 8 at the Ministry of Defense on the occasion of the 77th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. He also predicted that the conflict in Ukraine will continue to be one of the two 'main axes of international tension' in 2025. 'He noted that the main axis of international tension this year will be the Ukrainian problem and the crisis in the Middle East, including the Gaza Strip and Syria, which became a global geopolitical confrontation and conflict zone last year', CTAK reported. According to Kim, the crises created by the US in different parts of the world 'increase the danger of a new world war' and affect all areas of human activity, not just efforts to maintain peace on the planet.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 03:48 AM\nSource:[tass.ru](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/23090759)\n\n**ICC Condemns US Sanctions, Vows to Continue Dispensing Justice**\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) has condemned the decision by the White House to impose sanctions on it, calling it a 'serious attack' on the international order. The ICC stated, 'The ICC condemns the publication by the United States of a decree aimed at sanctioning its officials and hindering its independent and impartial judicial work.' The court also expressed its commitment to 'continuing to dispense justice' and giving 'hope to millions of innocent victims of atrocities around the world.' The ICC has been criticized in the US for issuing arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for 'war crimes' and 'crimes against humanity' in Gaza. The US decree accuses the ICC of taking 'unlawful and unfounded actions against the United States' and its 'close ally, Israel.' The text, released by the White House, prohibits ICC officials, employees, and agents from entering the US, as well as their closest family members and anyone who has assisted the court's investigative work. The decree also provides for freezing the assets of these individuals in the US, whose names have not been published yet. Israel quickly congratulated Trump and described the court's actions as 'immoral' and 'illegitimate.' The European Council, on the other hand, called the decree an 'attack' on the independence of the court. 'Sanctioning the ICC threatens the independence of the Court, and undermines the entire international justice system,' said Ant\u00f3nio Costa, president of the European Council. 79 countries, including Mexico, Chile, and Panama, expressed similar concerns, stating that such measures increase the risk of impunity for the most serious crimes and threaten the international rule of law. The UN also expressed its concerns, urging Trump to reconsider the measure. Ukraine hopes that the court will continue to pursue those responsible for war crimes in its country, which was invaded by Russia in February 2022. 'We hope that these US sanctions will not affect the court's ability to bring justice to the victims of the Russian aggression,' said Ukrainian diplomat Georgy Tikhi. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been the subject of an ICC arrest warrant since March 2023, accused of deporting Ukrainian children to Russia. The Kremlin strongly rejects these accusations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:41 AM\nSource:[Perfil](https://www.perfil.com/noticias/internacional/la-cpi-rechaza-las-sanciones-que-le-aplico-la-casa-blanca.phtml)\n\n**Ukraine Update: Military Gains, Sanctions, and Diplomatic Efforts**\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky will lead the Ukrainian delegation to the Munich Security Conference next week. The conference will discuss security issues, including the ongoing conflict with Russia. US President Donald Trump has stated that he is willing to impose additional sanctions on Russia to end the war. The US has already imposed sanctions on the International Criminal Court, accusing it of biased actions against the US and Israel. The Ukrainian military has made gains in the Kharkiv region, advancing 5 kilometers south-east of the town of Sudzha. The Russian military has suffered significant losses, with over 48,000 casualties reported in December 2024. The Ukrainian government has announced plans to increase the production of military equipment and technology. The European Union has pledged to provide financial support to Ukraine, with a focus on programs implemented by the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Ukraine is also seeking to establish a cluster of negotiations with the EU in April, with the goal of signing an international agreement by the end of 2025.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3957708-bitva-za-ukrainu-den-tisaca-visimdesatij.html)\n\n**Council of Europe Seeks Special Tribunal for Russian Invasion Crimes**\nThe Council of Europe aims to create a special tribunal to judge crimes related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and establish a compensation mechanism for damages. 'We want to ensure that the violations of rights perpetrated by Russia against Ukraine do not go unpunished, that impunity does not prevail,' said Council of Europe Secretary-General Alain Berset in an interview with AFP. The tribunal will be responsible for judging the crimes of the Russian invasion, but not war crimes, which are the responsibility of the International Criminal Court. Ukraine has been requesting the creation of a special tribunal since the start of the Russian invasion in February 2022. 'Existing jurisdictions do not have the competence to deal with the crime of aggression, so a specific jurisdiction is needed to deal with this crime that has been recognized by the United Nations,' explained Berset. A registry of damages has already been opened, allowing for compensation claims for property destruction or the death of a family member. 'We are in the process of expanding to other categories,' said Berset. The registry, launched in The Hague in April, has an office in Ukraine to collect statements. 'We now have 13,000 cases of damages registered with a very high quality, a legal quality to consider a compensation mechanism,' explained Berset. The final step will be the creation of the new system, allowing victims to be compensated. 'We are talking about damages of over $150 billion that have been registered to date,' revealed Berset, 'and are obviously increasing, [because] there is everything that has not been registered and everything that is still open for registration.' According to Berset, 'in the logic of repair, it is the one who caused the damage that must pay, and this will be part of the negotiation' to develop the compensation mechanism.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[SAPO 24](https://24.sapo.pt/atualidade/artigos/conselho-da-europa-quer-tribunal-especial-para-invasao-russa-as-jurisdicoes-existentes-nao-tem-competencia)\n\n**Russia Denies Concrete Negotiations with US on Ukraine**\nThe British newspaper Daily Mail has published a supposed peace plan for Ukraine proposed by former US President Donald Trump. However, the plan's authenticity has not been confirmed, and it is unclear where the British journalists got their information from. The plan suggests that a ceasefire would be implemented by Easter (April 20), with the sides agreeing on the details of the conflict's resolution by May 9. After that, Ukraine would end its state of war and mobilization, and the Ukrainian army would withdraw from the Kursk region. Ukraine would also give up its lost territories and the idea of joining NATO. European troops would be stationed in Ukraine to protect the demilitarized zone, with the British taking control. Russia would receive significant benefits, including the lifting of sanctions on Russian energy exports, with the funds going towards Ukraine's reconstruction. However, the Russian government has stated that there are no concrete negotiations between Russia and the US on Ukraine. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Russia is still willing to negotiate, but there is nothing concrete to discuss. Russian Ambassador to London Andrei Kelyin stated that Russia approaches negotiations with the US with caution, taking into account Washington's involvement in fanning the Ukrainian conflict. He also accused Trump, along with the US and UK, of being the authors of the Ukrainian campaign. The Russian Foreign Ministry has stated that the US must take the first step towards normalizing relations with Moscow, which is open to dialogue in a 'tough bargaining' mode. 'We are ready to negotiate, taking into account the realities on the ground and our national interests,' said Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 11:58 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u0430](https://rg.ru/2025/02/07/daily-mail-opublikovala-detali-predpolagaemogo-mirnogo-plana-trampa-po-ukraine.html)\n\n**Kyiv 'is very near to really ending war by a just and lasting peace'**\nUkrainian official Andriy Yermak has stated that Ukraine is 'very near to really ending this war by a just and lasting peace', but emphasized the importance of Ukraine's participation in any ceasefire plans. Yermak made the comments ahead of the Munich Security Conference, where US President Donald Trump is expected to unveil his plan for peace in Ukraine. The plan, which has been leaked and reported by a pro-Russian outlet, would see a ceasefire by April 20, a ban on Ukraine joining NATO, and a demand for Ukraine to accept Russian sovereignty on annexed land. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has denied the existence of the ceasefire plans, and the White House has yet to officially comment. If confirmed, the plan would see Zelensky and Vladimir Putin sharing a phone call before meeting in late February or early March, with an official ceasefire declaration to be made on April 20.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 10:22 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14371607/Ukraine-leaked-report-Trump-ceasefire-Easter.html)\n\n**US Reveals Plan to End Ukraine Conflict through Peaceful Means**\nUS President Donald Trump's administration has revealed its plan to end the conflict in Ukraine through peaceful means. According to a report by the British 'Daily Mail', Trump's plan aims to establish a ceasefire between Moscow and Kyiv by April 20. The 'Daily Mail' claims that Trump is urging Ukrainian President Zelensky to refrain from signing a peace treaty with Russia and to stop fighting until after Easter, which falls on April 20. The final peace agreement is expected to be signed later, symbolically by May 9, 2025. 'Daily Mail' reported, 'Zelensky was told to hold off on signing a peace treaty with Russia until after Easter, and to keep fighting until then.' \nOriginal language: uz\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 11:24 PM\nSource:[aniq.uz](https://aniq.uz/yangiliklar/ukrainadagi-urush-20-aprelda-yakunlanadi)\n\n**Trump\u2019s return and the fate of Ukraine**\nThree years into Russia's invasion, Ukraine remains sovereign and independent, but faces challenges on the battlefield.

A discussion on the war's path and U.S.-European relations with Ukraine will be held on February 24, 2025, featuring Brookings experts and the co-hosts of the 'Escalation' podcast, which chronicles the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine. As Trump pursues a broader foreign and trade policy agenda, the trans-Atlantic alliance is being rattled.

'We are waiting for signals that have not yet arrived,' said Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for President Vladimir Putin. Russia sees nothing new in Trump's threat to impose sanctions, with Peskov adding, 'He likes these methods, at least he liked them during his first presidency.' The response comes after a comment yesterday from Russia's deputy ambassador to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, who said that the Kremlin needs to know what Trump wants in an agreement to end the war before taking further action. Russia invaded and annexed part of Ukraine, Crimea, in 2014, and launched a large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Trump warned in a message on his Truth Social platform that if no deal is reached, he will have 'no other option but to put high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on any goods sold by Russia to the United States and other countries.' Trump had previously promised to end the war in Ukraine before taking office, leading some to believe that he could pressure Kiev into making concessions to Moscow.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 12:46 PM\nSource:[Clarin](https://www.clarin.com/mundo/guerra-ucrania-rusia-dice-abierta-dialogar-estados-unidos-amenazas-trump_0_UgTgzfk2IU.html)\n\n**Poland Accuses Russia of Planning Terrorist Acts Against Airlines Worldwide**\nPoland's Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, stated on Wednesday that Russia planned 'terrorist acts' against airlines worldwide, accusing Moscow of organizing sabotage and plane hijackings.

Tusk made this statement in front of Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky, who traveled to Poland, a neighboring country, to hold a series of meetings a few days before the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Poland, a member of the EU and NATO, is one of Ukraine's main allies since Russia invaded the country in February 2022. Tusk said, 'The acts of sabotage, the different versions of war that Russia has declared against the civilized world, not just Ukraine, require a common action.' With Poland holding the rotating presidency of the EU, Tusk has promised to do everything possible to advance the European Union membership process for Ukraine without conditions.

The agreement will be signed during Raisi's visit, and it is expected to expand cooperation in transportation, logistics, humanitarian aid, trade, and other areas. This move comes as Ukraine and Western countries accuse Iran of supplying Russia with explosives and drones, and assisting in their production. However, Tehran and Moscow have denied these allegations. Meanwhile, Iran has reportedly asked Moscow for air defense systems and fighter jets to counter Israel's long-range attacks. Iran is also expected to upgrade its air force with Russian-made Su-35 fighter jets. Raisi's visit is scheduled to take place just three days before US President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, which some have speculated could bring an end to the nearly three-year-long Ukraine-Russia conflict. Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, annexing Crimea, and then supported separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, which declared independence and were later annexed by Russia. The conflict escalated in 2022, with Russia launching a large-scale invasion of Ukraine, citing the need to 'liberate' the country from 'Nazis'.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 03:37 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://tr.euronews.com/2025/01/13/rusya-iran-cumhurbaskani-kapsamli-stratejik-ortaklik-anlasmasi-icin-cuma-gunu-moskovaya-ge)\n\n**US Expands NATO's Influence Amid Russia-Ukraine War**\nThe US has taken advantage of the war between Russia and Ukraine to expand NATO's influence. The US has benefited from its relationships with non-NATO countries, which have been developed over the years. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, 20 countries have joined the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called for Ukraine to be 'in the best position' before negotiations with Russia, saying 'Europeans have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in US defense industry.' Rutte also stated that the US defense industry is a significant investment for Europe, and that the removal of restrictions on the industry could reduce the risk of political conflicts over the purchase of weapon systems from non-NATO countries. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group will meet for the 25th time at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, where representatives from over 50 countries will discuss the provision of military aid to Ukraine. The group was first established in April 2022, when the US, UK, France, and a few other countries provided individual support to Ukraine. Since then, many countries have joined the group, and the number of countries providing support to Ukraine has increased to over 50. However, it is unclear whether the Trump administration, which takes office on January 20, will continue to support the group.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 03:09 PM\nSource:[H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/dunya/abd-savasta-firsat-gordu-nato-cevresini-genisletti-42653623)\n\n**Peace Agreement Between Russia and Ukraine Possible by April 20**\nAccording to sources, a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine could be reached by April 20 this year.

In an interview with popular podcaster Lex Fridman, Zelenski argued that Western countries should have imposed preventive sanctions on Russia before the operation to intimidate President Vladimir Putin. 'Everyone was saying something, predicting and so on, but I only asked one thing, first of all, from the United States,' Zelenski said. 'If you're sure, if you have evidence, if you're talking to him [Putin], tell him there will be an invasion, if you're afraid of all this, first of all, I'm not asking for evidence. Just give me two things,' he said. 'Strengthen us with arms. But the best of all, strengthen us with the precondition that there will be no war. It's not the arms, I'm talking about everything, about sanctions. That is, intimidate him. Please don't tell me that if they come, if they pass through the borders, if they kill, we'll impose sanctions. Well, it's a bunch of crap. I'm sorry. I really am,' he expressed. Meanwhile, the economic sanctions imposed on Russia shortly after the conflict in Ukraine have not met the expectations of Western countries, according to The New York Times. For example, despite the limitations on Russia's ability to sell oil, the country has found other markets, allowing it to 'fill its coffers.' 'And the European Union continues to buy almost 50% of the liquefied natural gas that Russia exports,' NYT notes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 05:05 PM\nSource:[elpaisvallenato.com](https://www.elpaisvallenato.com/2025/01/06/zelenski-reprocha-groseramente-la-postura-de-ee-uu-antes-del-conflicto-ucraniano/)\n\n**Zelensky Criticizes World for Lack of Support Before Russian Invasion**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed frustration in an interview with American podcaster Lex Fridman that the world did not provide sufficient support to Ukraine before the Russian invasion.

Blinken stated, 'We were able to ensure that not only we and our allies and partners were prepared, but that Ukraine was prepared.' The US had provided Ukraine with Stinger anti-aircraft missiles and Javelin anti-tank missiles, which were crucial in preventing Russia from capturing Kiev and overrunning the country. Meanwhile, Ukraine has reported a significant increase in Russian drone attacks, with the Ukrainian Air Force claiming to have shot down 34 out of 81 Russian drones in a single night. The EU has asked Ukraine to take back migrants who are not working or paying taxes, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded by saying, 'Strengthen your air defense, and I will recall all of them.' Zelensky had previously stated that 10-12 additional Patriot air defense systems could make life in Ukraine safe and make the war for Russia senseless. Additionally, Ukraine is reportedly developing new capabilities to counter Russian aggression, including the production of 30,000 long-range drones, 3,000 Marschflugk\u00f6rpern, and 3,000 Drohnenraketen.

Blinken emphasized that the US anticipated the conflict's development and was not alone in this, as 'allies and partners were ready, and Ukraine was ready.' He revealed that the US 'secretly delivered a large quantity of weapons to Ukraine well before the start of Russian aggression, starting in September [2021] and then in December [...] to make sure it had everything it needed for self-defense,' including Stinger and Javelin missiles, which played a crucial role in repelling Russia's attack on Kyiv. Blinken noted that the US made significant diplomatic efforts to gather and maintain the support of over 50 countries, 'not only in Europe, but also beyond its borders, in support of Ukraine and in defense of these principles that Russia also attacked in February 2022.' He stated that he worked extensively before the war, including meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, 'trying to find a way to prevent it.' The US aimed to determine whether Russia's concerns about its security, Ukraine, and NATO were genuine or if they were 'actually driven by imperial ambitions [of Russian President Vladimir] Putin and a desire to recreate a great Russia, take Ukraine back into Russia,' Blinken added. He expressed regret that 'there are no signs yet that Russia is genuinely ready to engage.' However, he expressed hope that the situation will change.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 04:18 PM\nSource:[gordonua.com](https://gordonua.com/ukr/news/worldnews/ssha-zadovho-do-pochatku-ahresiji-rf-tajemno-postavili-ukrajini-veliku-kilkist-zbroji-blinken-1728913.html)\n\n**Zelenskyy Vows to End Russian Invasion by 2025**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed that Ukraine will take all necessary measures to end the Russian invasion by 2025. According to Zelenskyy, '2025 is the year that belongs to us.' He emphasized that Ukraine will do its best to prevent Russia from invading and end the war, which is the wish of every Ukrainian. Zelenskyy also stated that Ukraine must continue to fight to gain the upper hand, both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. He believes that a strong Ukraine is the key to ensuring peace and gaining respect from the world. In 2024, Ukraine lost 7 times more territory than in 2023, with the US providing nearly $6 billion in military and budget aid to Ukraine on the last day of the year. Zelenskyy expressed optimism about the possibility of a peaceful resolution with Russia, saying 'I have no doubt that this new US president has the will and ability to achieve peace and end Putin's aggression.' \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 01, 2025 11:04 AM\nSource:[\u770b\u4e2d\u56fd](https://www.secretchina.com/news/gb/2025/01/01/1075371.html)\n\n**Ukraine to Continue Fighting Russian Invasion in 2025, Zelensky Says**\nUkrainian President Volodimir Zelensky stated on Tuesday that his country will continue to face the Russian invasion in both the 'battlefield' and the 'negotiation table' in 2025. Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine's commitment to strengthening the country and ensuring it is 'respected and heard' remains a priority. Despite the challenging context, including the loss of significant territory to Russian forces in 2024, Zelensky expressed confidence in the return of Donald Trump to the US presidency, saying, 'I have no doubt that the new US president desires and is capable of achieving peace and ending Putin's aggression.' Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky accused the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Robert Fico, of opening a 'second energy front' against Ukraine at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin, amid tensions over gas transit between the two countries.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 01, 2025 04:14 AM\nSource:[infobae.com](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/01/01/volodimir-zelensky-prometio-luchar-por-ucrania-para-fortalecer-el-pais-y-garantizar-que-sea-respetado-y-escuchado-durante-el-2025/)\n\n**Zelenskyy: Ukraine Will Do Everything in 2025 to Stop Russia**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has vowed that his country will do everything in 2025 to stop Russia's nearly three-year-long invasion by any means necessary. Zelenskyy said, 'May 2025 be our year,' and 'We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift, but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war.' Ukraine lost seven times more territory to Russia this year than in 2023, and is facing the possibility of a reduction in U.S. military and political backing when President-elect Donald Trump takes over the White House. Zelenskyy has urged his war-battered country's allies to help end the invasion and bring lasting peace in 2025. 'I have no doubt that the new American president is willing and capable of achieving peace and ending (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's aggression,' Zelenskyy said.

The conflict has escalated with the recent use of long-range missiles by the US and UK, which has led to a significant increase in violence. The US has provided Ukraine with ATACMS and Storm Shadow missiles, which have been used to attack Russian positions. Russia has responded with its own hypersonic missiles, including the Ore\u015fnik, and has even threatened to use nuclear weapons. However, the US and UK have made it clear that they will not back down, with the UK's General Rob Magovan stating, 'If the British army is asked to fight tonight, we will fight tonight.' The conflict has caused significant economic and human losses for both Ukraine and Russia, with estimates suggesting that Russia has lost between 300,000 and 600,000 soldiers. The US is now shifting its focus to other regions, including Asia and the Middle East, and is expected to continue its support for Israel. The article concludes that the conflict in Ukraine is likely to continue, with the US and Russia engaging in a game of cat and mouse. 'The big Satan' (US) is expected to focus on other regions in the coming years, including Asia and the Middle East, and will continue to support Israel. The article ends with a quote from former MIT head Hakan Fidan, who stated that the international relations in 2025 will be even more challenging than this year. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: December 23, 2024 04:20 AM\nSource:[\u0130nternethaber](https://www.internethaber.com/abd-ukrayna-rusya-savasini-bitirmek-istiyor-mu-2384592y.htm)\n\n**Putin's 'Occupation Expansion' Strategy: A Threat to Ukraine and the World**\nAs the second Trump administration is set to begin on January 20, 2025, US President Donald Trump is eager to start negotiations for a ceasefire in the Ukraine invasion war before his inauguration. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is also preparing for ceasefire talks, and is likely to focus on 'occupation expansion' as a key theme. In ceasefire negotiations, the line of contact (military boundary) is usually set based on the current front line. However, Putin is likely to think that if he can push the front line forward by even a millimeter and occupy more Ukrainian territory, it will be beneficial. In the Korean War (1950-53), a similar 'occupation expansion' was a key issue between North and South Korea. The war stagnated in the spring of 1951, and ceasefire negotiations began in the summer of the same year. However, both sides clashed in an attempt to expand their territory before the ceasefire agreement was signed. The war continued for about two years, with both sides engaging in a series of fierce battles in the central part of the Korean Peninsula. Ultimately, the front line remained largely unchanged, with the 38th parallel remaining the main dividing line. The battles for control of strategic high ground were particularly brutal, with the White Horse Hill battle seeing 12 rounds of fighting over 14 days, with the attackers and defenders switching sides 7 times. Other notable battles include the Bloody Ridge, Heartbreak Ridge, and Panmunjom battles. For Putin, recovering lost territory in the Kursk region, which was captured by Ukrainian forces in a counterattack, is a top priority. If Russia's territory is occupied by foreign forces, it would be a humiliating situation, and could even hinder ceasefire negotiations. Therefore, Putin is likely to try to recover the lost territory as soon as possible through occupation expansion.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 12, 2024 09:15 PM\nSource:[JBpress\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u30d3\u30b8\u30cd\u30b9\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\uff09](https://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/85446)\n\n",
