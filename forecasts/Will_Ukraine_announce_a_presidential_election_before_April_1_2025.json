According to the bill, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was elected through a legitimate election, cannot be questioned about his term. The statement also emphasizes that no elections can be held until 'a just and lasting peace' is achieved and martial law is lifted. Zelensky's term as president is set to end in May 2024, but due to the ongoing war, the scheduled presidential election in March 2024 was postponed.

The bill aimed to hold presidential elections in Ukraine as soon as the country receives a fair and lasting peace guarantee. However, the bill only received 218 votes, falling short of the 226 votes needed for passage. This comes after a heated exchange between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian officials over 'wartime elections' and 'Zelensky's approval ratings.' Trump urged Ukraine to cease fire and hold elections, but was met with strong opposition from Zelensky and Ukrainian opposition leaders. According to Ukrainian International Information Agency, even opposition leaders acknowledged the legitimacy of the Rada and Zelensky's presidency. Zelensky's term is set to end in May 2024, but due to the ongoing war, Ukraine has not held presidential elections as scheduled in March 2024. Zelensky has extended the state of war in Ukraine until May 9, 2024, according to a recent presidential decree.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 01:21 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News](https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E7%92%B0%E7%9C%8B%E5%A4%A9%E4%B8%8B-%E5%BE%B7%E5%9C%8B%E5%A4%A7%E9%81%B8%E7%94%B1%E8%81%AF%E7%9B%9F%E9%BB%A8%E5%8B%9D%E5%87%BA-%E6%9F%8F%E6%9E%97%E6%9C%AA%E4%BE%86%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E5%8F%96%E6%85%8B%E6%83%B9%E9%97%9C%E6%B3%A8-012143904.html)\n\n**Ukrainian Parliament Passes Bill Prohibiting Wartime Elections**\nThe Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill that prohibits holding elections during wartime, emphasizing that the constitution does not allow for elections in a state of war. The bill also supports President Volodymyr Zelensky in continuing to fulfill his duties. According to a statement from the parliament, Ukraine will hold elections after 'comprehensive, fair, and lasting peace' is ensured, and Zelensky will continue to exercise his powers until then. Zelensky was elected as president in 2019 and his term was supposed to end in 2024, but due to the war, the new presidential election was postponed. The parliament's statement emphasized that Zelensky is a democratically elected president and his legitimacy has not been questioned by the people or the parliament. 'It is essential that President Zelensky continues to exercise his powers in accordance with the Constitution until a new president is elected,' the statement said. In contrast, US President Donald Trump recently called for Ukraine to stop fighting and hold presidential elections as soon as possible. 'We urge the Ukrainian government to hold elections as soon as possible,' Trump said.

However, the resolution was later passed with 268 votes in favor, despite officially expiring on May 20, 2024.

The resolution also emphasized that Zelensky was elected through free and transparent democratic elections, as recognized by the international community. In contrast, the parliament warned that holding elections under martial law would be 'comical' and would undermine the principles of international election standards, similar to the 2024 Russian presidential election. The resolution also stated that the responsibility for delaying the presidential election lies with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that the Ukrainian parliament and people do not question Zelensky's authority. 'The Ukrainian parliament declares that it will hold presidential elections in accordance with its decision, ensuring that they are conducted in accordance with all international election standards,' the resolution said. Zelensky's term was originally set to end in May last year, but was extended due to the war.

Poroshenko, who recently faced personal sanctions from President Volodymyr Zelensky, is likely considering a return to the presidency. He drew an analogy with Donald Trump's recent return to the White House, but unlike Trump, Poroshenko will have to face the incumbent president, whose legitimacy is questioned by the opposition. Zelensky previously stated at the Munich Conference that Ukrainians do not want elections, but the data on ballot preparation contradicts his words. According to Sofia Fedina, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, the state-owned enterprise 'Ukraine' has received an order to calculate the costs of printing ballots, which will start soon. She believes that this step indicates preparation for a change of power, but may also be part of Zelensky's strategy to neutralize potential competitors. Former US President Donald Trump stated in an interview that Ukraine must hold elections, as the level of trust in Zelensky among the population is rapidly declining. According to a survey published on January 22, Ukrainians are increasingly losing trust in the incumbent president, with the highest level of trust belonging to the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate, Kirill Budanov (46.7%), followed by former Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Valery Zaluzhny (34.9%).

Zelensky spoke out against elections, noting that Ukrainians prefer unity in the face of conflict rather than elections. He also advised those who insist on elections to change their citizenship. 'Note -- October 26 this year', Poroshenko said, as reported by the Ukrainian edition 'Censor.net'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 03:53 PM\nSource:[URA.RU](https://ura.news/news/1052889825)\n\n**Ukraine: No presidential election in 2025?**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is under pressure to hold a presidential election this year, but many experts warn of serious risks involved. Zelenskyy has stated that elections will be announced when martial law is lifted, but US special envoy Keith Kellogg has called for elections before the end of the year, saying they are 'good for democracy.' Russia has cast doubt on Zelenskyy's legitimacy as president, citing the cancellation of the election scheduled for spring 2024. Ukraine's constitution prohibits elections under martial law, and Moscow has demanded a new presidential election before signing a settlement to end the war. Experts warn that holding elections too soon could create unrest and division among the population, and that Ukraine is not yet ready for free and fair elections. John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, believes that elections could only be held under certain conditions, including more weapons for Ukraine, a demilitarized zone, and the presence of European troops. Thomas Greminger, the former secretary general of the OSCE, warns against holding elections too soon, saying that a degree of stability and good preparation are required. Winfried Schneider-Deters, a Ukraine expert, believes that the Russians have 'perfidious' motives and that Ukraine should not yield to potential pressure from Washington. Zelenskyy has avoided unambiguous statements, saying only that Ukraine is ready to make compromises and would like to hold elections, but that certain conditions are required for this to be possible.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 07:17 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-no-presidential-election-in-2025/a-71549712)\n\n**Zelenski: Presidential Elections in Ukraine Could Take Place in 2025**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski has stated that the country's long-delayed presidential elections could take place in 2025, depending on the outcome of ongoing peace negotiations. Zelenski emphasized that the end of the 'hot phase' of the war would be a crucial factor in determining when the elections can be held. He also mentioned that once martial law is lifted, the parliament will be able to schedule elections. Zelenski's five-year term was set to end on May 20, 2024, but he has not yet announced whether he will run for re-election. The presidential election was initially scheduled for March or April 2024, but was postponed due to the ongoing war and martial law. According to the Ukrainian Constitution, Zelenski must continue to serve until a new president is elected. Many analysts and politicians have expressed concerns about security, displaced voters, and infrastructure, which they believe make it difficult to hold legitimate elections during the current circumstances. Zelenski stated, 'In Ukraine, people are worried about elections during the war, and in Russia, they strongly desire this to happen \u2013 so they continue to give impulse to their narrative about the illegitimacy of the President of Ukraine.'\nOriginal language: ro\nPublish date: January 05, 2025 08:27 AM\nSource:[infos.ro](https://romania.europalibera.org/a/cand-ar-putea-avea-loc-alegeri-prezidentiale-in-ucraina-zelenski-spune-ca-in-2025/33263823.html)\n\n",
