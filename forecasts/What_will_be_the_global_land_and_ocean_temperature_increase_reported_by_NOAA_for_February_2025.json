According to the latest long-term forecasts, the summer could be slightly warmer than average, but with significant regional variations in rainfall. Some models suggest that heavy rainfall could affect large parts of the country, leading to tropical nights with warm rain, severe thunderstorms, and flash floods. Diplom-Meteorologe Dominik Jung from wetter.net warns, 'The latest long-term forecasts show that the summer of 2025 in Germany could be slightly warmer than average. However, the rainfall amounts seem to vary strongly regionally.' The CFS-Model of the NOAA is a long-term model that works with statistical probabilities, evaluating global temperature developments, ocean currents, and atmospheric patterns to identify possible trends. However, such predictions should be enjoyed with caution, as short-term weather conditions can influence these trends at any time. Experts recommend preparing early for possible heatwaves and storms, especially in cities, which need to find new ways to cope with extreme summers, such as better drainage systems or heat-resistant urban greenery.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[kreiszeitung.de](https://www.kreiszeitung.de/deutschland/experte-erklaert-aktuelle-wettertrends-hitze-regenfluten-tropennaechte-wetterprognosen-deuten-auf-ausnahme-sommer-2025-hin-zr-93560912.html)\n\n**La Ni&#xf1;a&#x2019;s Return Cools the Pacific and Shakes Up Global Weather**\nLa Ni\u00f1a has returned to the Pacific, cooling the region and disrupting global weather patterns. According to NOAA, this La Ni\u00f1a is weak and likely short-lived, and will not counteract rising global temperatures. The phenomenon, part of the ENSO cycle, strengthens trade winds and brings up deep, cold ocean water, altering temperatures and rainfall worldwide. NOAA confirms that La Ni\u00f1a conditions are present, with sea surface temperatures 0.7 degrees Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) below average in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region. Josh Willis, an oceanographer and Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich project scientist, said, 'Although La Ni\u00f1a is here, it's not a particularly strong one.' NOAA forecasts that this La Ni\u00f1a will remain weak and is unlikely to reach -1\u00b0C below average -- the threshold at which La Ni\u00f1a is considered moderate in strength. Neutral conditions are expected to return in the meteorological spring, between March and May. La Ni\u00f1a's coupling with the atmosphere and ocean can cause shifts in the path of mid-latitude jet streams, leading to global weather disruptions, including increased rainfall in some regions and drought in others.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 04:22 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

Meteorologist Tatyana Pozdnyakova explains that the warm winter is due to the characteristics of air circulation, more typical of spring. According to the Moscow State University, January 2025 was the warmest month in the history of instrumental observations in Moscow, with an average temperature close to zero. Some forecasters predict a drought, tornadoes, and twisters for the summer. Tatyana Pozdnyakova acknowledges the possibility of such catastrophes, but notes that making accurate long-term forecasts is premature. Even the weather for the next 10 days is difficult to predict. Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, said that, according to preliminary estimates, 2025 will be among the top three or five hottest years on the planet, although it is unlikely to break the record. He noted that these forecasts require clarification and will be adjusted throughout the year. The situation is complicated by the change in ocean currents. Currently, La Ni\u00f1a is observed, which absorbs heat from the ocean. However, a transition to a neutral phase is expected in April. The further dynamics of the weather will depend on the possible development of El Ni\u00f1o, which causes an abnormal increase in water temperature in the Pacific Ocean and affects the global climate. It is worth noting that the consequences of the previous El Ni\u00f1o led to 2024 becoming the hottest year on record. In Penza, the abnormal heat has caused the ice to melt on the rivers, surprising fishermen who were preparing to fish in February. However, the weather may change abruptly, with significant snowfall expected in Penza by February 23. Meanwhile, experts predict that the crop in the Penza region may perish due to the multiplication of pests. The unusually warm winter has created favorable conditions for the multiplication of locusts, meadow moths, and rodents.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 02:10 PM\nSource:[stolica58.ru](https://stolica58.ru/news/obcshestvo/bezumnaya-zhara-sinoptiki-predrekayut-samoe-zharkoe-leto-v-2025-godu)\n\n**NOAA Data Exposes Climate Hysteria: Sea Level Rise Predictions of 1988 Proven Spectacularly Wrong**\nRecent data from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) for 2024 reveals a stark contrast between climate predictions made in 1988 and the actual measurements. While climate alarmists and politicians predicted dramatic increases in sea level rise, the actual data paints a different picture. The Battery Station in New York, which has been measuring sea level rise since 1856, shows a current trend of 2.92 millimeters per year, which is not statistically significant from the values of the past decades. This is in stark contrast to the predictions made in 1988, which forecasted an increase of about 6.35 centimeters per decade (or 63.5 centimeters per century) - six times the rate observed at the time. The reality is that between 2014 and 2024, the change in the rate of sea level rise at the Battery Station was just 0.08 millimeters per year - a fraction of the predicted values. Similar patterns are seen at other measurement stations like Honolulu and San Diego. It's worth noting that global CO2 emissions have increased from 20.85 to 35.13 billion tons since 1988, mainly due to developing countries like China and India, while Western industrial nations have actually reduced their emissions. The NOAA map of US coastal regions shows mostly moderate changes in relative sea level of 1.7 to 1.8 millimeters per year - about 17 to 18 centimeters per century. Local deviations can be explained by geological factors like land uplift or subsidence. The data raises fundamental questions: how could the discrepancy between model predictions and reality become so large? And more importantly, what consequences should we draw from this obvious failure of climate predictions for our current political decisions?\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[report24.news](https://report24.news/meeresspiegel-hysterie-entlarvt-noaa-daten-widerlegen-klimaprognosen-von-1988/)\n\n**Record January heat suggests La Ni\u00f1a may be losing its ability to keep global warming in check**\nJanuary 2025 was the hottest January on record, with temperatures 1.7\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This contradicts expectations that the natural 'La Ni\u00f1a' phenomenon would cool the world slightly this year. However, human-driven ocean warming is increasingly overwhelming these natural climate patterns. Scientists note that each El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a cycle is unique, and the recent 'triple dip' La Ni\u00f1a starting in 2020 and the weak La Ni\u00f1a in 2024 have not been enough to stop the world warming. Research shows that human-caused warming of the ocean is accelerating, dominating over El Ni\u00f1o and other natural climate patterns. This means that even during La Ni\u00f1a, the rest of the world's oceans have remained remarkably warm. As greenhouse gas levels continue to grow, the rate of rise in atmospheric carbon in 2024 and January 2025 has remained high. The article concludes that natural cooling phases may become less effective at temporarily offsetting the impact of rising greenhouse gas levels on global temperatures, and that urgent action is needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and properly account for the true cost of our lifestyles on societies and ecosystems.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 06:24 AM\nSource:[Down to Earth](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/climate-change/record-january-heat-suggests-la-ni%C3%B1a-may-be-losing-its-ability-to-keep-global-warming-in-check)\n\n**The Arctic on the Brink of Disappearance: How Rising Temperatures Will Change Our Planet**\nThe year 2024 was a historic one, as the global average temperature exceeded the pre-industrial level by 1.5\u00b0C for the first time. This led to record-breaking rainfall in the Sahara desert and an abnormal summer heatwave. However, according to forecasts, we are heading towards an even greater increase in temperature. Taking into account current commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the planet's temperature may rise by 2.7\u00b0C by the end of the century. This will have even more severe consequences, particularly for the Arctic region, which is warming four times faster than the rest of the Earth. A recent study published in the journal Science on February 7, 2025, examines the consequences of such climate change for the Arctic. The study's author, Julianne Stroove, a senior research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, describes how the region will change and what we can expect if the temperature continues to rise. 'Our article shows that humanity can already erase entire landscapes from the map. The future of the Arctic is in our hands, and this requires enormous responsibility,' emphasizes Dirk Notz, a professor of polar research at the University of Hamburg. Such changes will not only lead to the destruction of ecosystems but also harm vulnerable communities. As the Arctic becomes more accessible, construction will become increasingly risky, and ecosystems accustomed to stable conditions will be at risk of extinction.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 04:27 AM\nSource:[Pravda](https://www.pravda.ru/news/science/2174563-arctic-warming-climate/)\n\n**January 2025 Sets Record for Highest Temperature, Surprising Scientists**\nJanuary 2025 broke the record for the highest temperature, surprising scientists. According to the Coepernicus European Climate Monitoring Service, the average global temperature in the past month was 1.75\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level. This trend continues the series of record-breaking highs observed in 2023 and 2024, causing concern among climate scientists. Scientists had expected a cooling phase of La Ni\u00f1a to follow the El Ni\u00f1o-induced warming peak, but this did not happen. January was 0.09\u00b0C warmer than the previous record set in 2024, which was unexpected, as all La Ni\u00f1a periods in the past 60 years have been cooler than the preceding El Ni\u00f1o years. The weak La Ni\u00f1a event this year may have contributed to the high temperatures, which are expected to persist until March. The surface ocean temperature remains anomalously high, which also affects the climate. Scientists warn that each additional increase in temperature will exacerbate extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. Although the current records do not mean a permanent exceedance of the 1.5\u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement, they indicate a close approach to this limit. Possible causes of the abnormal warming include reduced sulfur emissions due to the transition to cleaner ship fuel, which reduced the cloud's reflective ability. Scientists continue to study this issue, emphasizing that the burning of fossil fuels remains the main factor in long-term warming.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:27 PM\nSource:[\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd.Ru](https://www.gazeta.ru/science/news/2025/02/09/25042544.shtml)\n\n**Year 2024 NOAA Measured Sea level Rise Data Show Climate Alarmists CO2 Driven Sea Level Rise Acceleration Claims Have Spectacularly Failed**\nNOAA's year 2024 measured sea level rise data for U.S. stations shows that climate alarmists' claims of accelerating sea level rise due to increasing CO2 emissions have failed. Despite a 74% increase in global CO2 emissions from 1988 to 2023, driven by developing nations, the sea level rise acceleration rate has not increased as predicted. In fact, the NOAA Battery Station in New York showed a sea level rise trend of 2.92 +/- 0.09 mm/yr, which is the same as in 2023 and not significantly different from previous years. Similarly, the Honolulu Station in Hawaii showed a sea level rise trend of 1.56 +/- 0.20 mm/yr, and the San Diego Station showed a trend of 2.23 +/- 0.17 mm/yr. These results contradict the climate alarmists' claims of accelerating sea level rise and highlight the need to reevaluate energy policy schemes based on these failed predictions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 01:53 PM\nSource:[wattsupwiththat.com](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/02/09/year-2024-noaa-measured-sea-level-rise-data-show-climate-alarmists-co2-driven-sea-level-rise-acceleration-claims-have-spectacularly-failed/)\n\n**January sets 'surprising' heat record - EU monitor**\nJanuary 2025 has set a record for the hottest January on record, according to Europe's climate monitor, the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Despite expectations that cooler La Nina conditions would subside a streak of record-breaking global temperatures, the heat has lingered at record or near record levels. Climate scientist Julien Nicolas said, 'This is what makes it a bit of a surprise... you're not seeing this cooling effect, or temporary brake at least, on the global temperature that we were expecting to see.' The average global temperature in January was 1.75C hotter than pre-industrial times, with Arctic sea ice hitting a monthly record low. Scientists warn that every fraction of a degree of warming above 1.5C increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Copernicus said it will be closely monitoring ocean temperatures throughout 2025 for hints about how the climate might behave. Nicolas said, 'This heat is bound to resurface periodically,' and that scientists are still debating the causes of the prolonged heat. 'It's really still a matter of debate,' he said. The EU monitor uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft, and weather stations to aid its climate calculations. Scientists say the period being lived through right now is likely the warmest the Earth has been for the last 125,000 years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 09:04 AM\nSource:[sinardaily.my](https://www.sinardaily.my/article/225264/focus/world/january-sets-surprising-heat-record---eu-monitor)\n\n**January 2025 Temperature Records Shock the Scientific Community**\nJanuary 2025 was the warmest month on record, surprising climate scientists who had predicted colder conditions. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, January was 1.75\u00b0C warmer than the pre-industrial period. The cause is attributed to greenhouse gas emissions, which are causing global warming. Scientists are studying the phenomenon to understand other factors that may be contributing to the warming. Each increase in temperature will lead to more frequent and intense weather events, such as heavy rainfall, heatwaves, and droughts. According to oceanographer and climatologist Stefan Rahmstorf, this is the first time that temperatures have exceeded those of El Ni\u00f1o during a La Ni\u00f1a event, causing concern. Copernicus has stated that the temperatures recorded in some areas of the Equatorial Pacific Ocean suggest a slowdown in the cooling process. The global average temperature for 2023-2024 has exceeded 1.5\u00b0C, challenging the Paris Agreement's limit on global warming. According to climate predictions, 2025 will be the third warmest year on record. Copernicus will continue to monitor ocean temperatures throughout the year to provide insights on climate behavior and global warming.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 11:08 AM\nSource:[Lega Nerd](https://leganerd.com/2025/02/09/le-temperature-record-di-gennaio-2025-stupiscono-il-mondo-scientifico/)\n\n**La Ni\u00f1a Is Here**\nLa Ni\u00f1a, a cooler weather pattern, has finally arrived in the eastern Pacific Ocean after seven months of waiting. According to NOAA, La Ni\u00f1a may not last long, with neutral conditions expected to return in spring 2025. La Ni\u00f1a is characterized by intensified easterly trade winds that cool the surface waters in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean, affecting the atmosphere and global temperatures. NOAA measured sea surface temperatures 0.7 degrees Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) below average in the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region. Josh Willis, an oceanographer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said, 'Although La Ni\u00f1a is here, it's not a particularly strong one.' NOAA forecasts that this La Ni\u00f1a will remain weak and is unlikely to reach -1\u00b0C below average, the threshold for a moderate La Ni\u00f1a. La Ni\u00f1a can cause shifts in global atmospheric circulation, leading to changes in rainfall patterns and droughts in some regions. In the western Pacific, rainfall can increase over Indonesia and Australia, while dry conditions can occur in Brazil and other parts of South America. In North America, cooler and stormier conditions often set in across the Pacific Northwest, while warmer and drier conditions can occur across the southern United States and northern Mexico.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 11:09 PM\nSource:[NASA Earth Observatory](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/153917/la-nina-is-here)\n\n**Scientists Predict Hottest January on Record for 2025**\nScientists predict that January 2025 will be the hottest January on record. While it is expected to be slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024, current temperature records are surprising scientists. The reason for the increase in temperature is not yet clear, but it is possible that it is due to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The Pacific Ocean's surface temperature, which had risen unusually high in January 2024 due to El Ni\u00f1o, has returned to normal. However, the global temperature has continued to rise, with 2023 temperatures being about 0.2 degrees higher than expected. The La Ni\u00f1a conditions that were expected to bring cooler temperatures have not materialized, and January 2025 has broken the record for the hottest January on record, with a temperature 0.1 degrees higher than January 2024. 'The world's oceans are behaving differently, and we are looking at how ocean temperatures are evolving because they directly affect air temperatures,' said Samantha Burgess, assistant director of Copernicus. Many scientists predict that 2025 will be slightly cooler than 2023 and 2024, but the current temperatures have left them puzzled. 'We don't know the exact reason for this,' said Adam Scaife, head of the monthly and annual forecasting section at the UK Meteorological Office. 'A few months ago, if someone had asked me how January 2025 would compare to January 2024, I would have said it would be cooler. Now we know it won't be, and we don't know why.' Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, said, 'The main reason for this warming trend is the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. We are trying to determine the exact reasons for the record-breaking temperatures in 2023, 2024, and 2025.' 'If we don't stop greenhouse gas emissions, global temperatures will continue to rise,' said Burgess.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 09:56 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/guncel/bilim-insanlari-ocak-2025-tum-zamanlarin-en-sicak-ocak-ayi-olacak-18343004-haberi/)\n\n**January 2025 Breaks Global Temperature Record, Raising Concerns for the Rest of the Year**\nJanuary 2025 has broken the record for the highest global temperature ever recorded, surpassing the previous record set in 2024. This unexpected increase in temperature occurred without the influence of an El Ni\u00f1o event, which historically contributes to global warming. The Earth is currently experiencing moderate La Ni\u00f1a conditions, which should have resulted in a slight decrease in global temperatures. The anomaly is a concern, as the past two years have seen global temperatures hover around and above the 1.5\u00b0C threshold above pre-industrial levels. Experts are still analyzing the factors that caused this thermal anomaly, including the possible influence of ocean warming, which has been occurring in recent years. The reduction of sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctica may also be accelerating the warming process. The evolution of global temperatures after the peak of the 2023 El Ni\u00f1o event shows an atypical behavior, with current temperatures at the upper end of the historical range, even after adjusting for statistical trends. This phenomenon suggests that underlying climate mechanisms may be undergoing structural changes, making predictions more uncertain. Models indicate that the Earth could experience a decrease in temperatures in February as the Northern Hemisphere enters a more intense seasonal cooling phase. However, the occurrence of such a notable record at the beginning of the year raises concerns about the possibility of 2025 being one of the three warmest years on record, contrary to initial predictions. Experts from the UK Met Office, NASA, Berkeley Earth, and Carbon Brief have been projecting global temperatures for 2025, using various climate models and comparing them to historical averages. While none of these projections anticipated a record in January, the new data is being incorporated into updated models that may provide a clearer picture of what to expect in the coming months. The uncertainty surrounding future temperatures reinforces the urgency of acting on climate change. The continued increase in global average temperatures increases the risk of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, and more intense storms.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[meteored.com.ar](https://www.meteored.com.ar/noticias/actualidad/enero-de-2025-rompe-record-de-temperatura-global-y-sorprende-a-los-expertos.html)\n\n**Unexpected High Temperature Reading on New Year's**\nThe global sea level has returned to its previous level after a significant drop in the first part of 2024. According to NOAA, the world's oceans released a lot of heat in the final phase of the large El Ni\u00f1o event in 2023. The explanation for the sudden drop in global sea level in early 2024 lies in a combination of heat release from the ocean and geographical distribution of precipitation around the globe. The global sea surface temperature is currently at a record high, considering that the Pacific Ocean is almost in a La Ni\u00f1a state. The global temperature at the surface has surprised by being at a record high level a few weeks in January. The Arctic sea ice has started melting two weeks earlier than in the beginning of the measurement series. The extent of sea ice in the Arctic has started at a near-record low level this year, while it is closer to normal in Antarctica. 'It will be interesting to see if the record warm start to 2025 continues,' the author says. 'Will the sea level curve rise quickly, and how will the Arctic sea ice behave?'

The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) index is projected to return to near-average levels. Above-normal temperatures are predicted over most land areas for the February-April 2025 period, except for regions near the Bering Sea, the Gulf of Alaska, Baja California, and southwestern Greenland. Regions with a high probability of above-normal temperatures include South America south of the equator, the Caribbean and Central America, and Europe. In contrast, coastal areas of southern South America are expected to experience below or near-normal temperatures.

The NOAA's Climate Prediction Center has analyzed the latest data and found that the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is in its cold phase, known as La Ni\u00f1a. The ENSO is a coupled ocean-atmosphere system that lasts for several months, and its changes affect global atmospheric conditions, modifying temperature and precipitation patterns. The NOAA's analysis shows that the surface temperature of the Pacific Ocean has cooled, with the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index dropping to -0.6\u00b0C in December, indicating a La Ni\u00f1a event. However, some scientists argue that the ENSO is still in a neutral phase, and that La Ni\u00f1a may not persist for the next few months. The NOAA's Climate Prediction Center predicts that La Ni\u00f1a will be weak and short-lived, with a 60% chance of transitioning to ENSO-neutral conditions in March-May 2025. The probability of La Ni\u00f1a persisting until March-May 2025 is around 40%. The NOAA emphasizes that the ENSO is a complex system, and that predicting its behavior is challenging. 'The wait is over and La Ni\u00f1a is officially here,' said the NOAA, 'but the debate is open.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[meteored.com.ar](https://www.meteored.com.ar/noticias/actualidad/noaa-afirma-la-nina-esta-entre-nosotros-debil-corta-duracion-oceano-mar-temperatura-pacifico-lluvia-sequia-argentina-debate.html)\n\n**Global Ocean Temperature Sets New Record High in 2024**\nA recent report by an international research team, consisting of 54 scientists from 31 research units, has revealed that the global ocean temperature and heat content have reached a new record high in 2024. The report, published in the journal 'ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES', shows that the global average sea surface temperature has increased by 0.07\u00b0C, 0.05\u00b0C, and 0.06\u00b0C compared to 2023, according to data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the European Copernicus Marine Service, respectively. This marks a new high in modern records. The report also found that the ocean's warming is not uniform, with significant regional differences. The Indian Ocean, the tropical Atlantic, the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the North Pacific, and the Southern Ocean all set new historical highs in 2024. The rapid warming of the ocean and the accumulation of heat are threatening the ocean's ecological environment and human sustainable development. In 2024, 104 countries recorded the highest temperature in history, with many experiencing extreme weather events, including droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires, affecting South Africa, South Asia, the Philippines, Brazil, Europe, and the northeastern United States. The report warns that the continued warming of the ocean will lead to a decrease in dissolved oxygen in the ocean, affecting the stability of marine ecosystems and ultimately impacting human development and utilization of marine fisheries resources. The ocean is also the source of energy for typhoons and hurricanes, and warmer oceans will lead to more intense and frequent extreme weather events, causing economic and social losses. For example, the super typhoon 'Makar' that hit Hainan in September 2024 caused direct economic losses of approximately 80 billion yuan. These extreme climate events are all linked to the global system's warming trend.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 12:59 PM\nSource:[big5.cctv.com](http://big5.cctv.com/gate/big5/news.cctv.com/2025/01/10/ARTIFXvrb6ns7HATKLvy6AAC250110.shtml)\n\n**La Ni\u00f1a is Official: A Weak but Global Phenomenon**\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has recently announced that La Ni\u00f1a is now present, but it is expected to be a weak and short-lived event. According to forecasts, La Ni\u00f1a has a 59% chance of persisting from February to April 2025, while there is a 60% chance of a return to neutral ENSO conditions from March to May 2025. La Ni\u00f1a is a phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle, characterized by cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. This phenomenon has a significant impact on the global climate, modifying temperature and precipitation patterns. The presence of La Ni\u00f1a is confirmed by the decline of the Ni\u00f1o-3.4 index, which measures sea surface temperature. In December 2024, the index dropped to -0.6 \u00b0C, surpassing the threshold necessary to define La Ni\u00f1a. Other important signals include strengthened trade winds, increased rainfall in Indonesia, and a drier Pacific central region. La Ni\u00f1a was expected as early as spring 2024, but its development was slower than predicted. Despite some atmospheric signals similar to La Ni\u00f1a in the preceding months, the actual cooling of the tropical Pacific Ocean surface did not occur until December 2024. These delays have made the phenomenon less intense than expected. Emerging late in the year, La Ni\u00f1a will have less time to strengthen further. The delay is likely due to warmer-than-average oceans, which may have hindered the necessary cooling, and sub-seasonal events that may have temporarily interfered with its development. Although classified as weak, La Ni\u00f1a will still have significant effects on the global climate in the coming months, including intense rainfall in regions like Indonesia and Australia, drought in South America and the Pacific central region, and colder winters in some areas of North America.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 12:03 AM\nSource:[3BMeteo | Previsioni Meteo](https://www.3bmeteo.com/giornale-meteo/meteo--la-ni-ntilde-a--egrave--ufficiale--un-fenomeno-debole-ma-con-effetti-globali-734950)\n\n**La Ni\u00f1a Conditions Increase with Pacific Ocean Cooling**\nThe La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon is expected to occur due to the cooling of the equatorial Pacific Ocean, with temperatures dropping to 0.7\u00b0C below average, according to the NOAA. However, for La Ni\u00f1a to be confirmed, temperatures need to remain below -0.5\u00b0C for several months. Climate models suggest that this condition will persist until February to April 2025, but there is no consensus among models about the duration of the low temperatures. Even if La Ni\u00f1a is confirmed, it is expected to be of weak intensity and short duration. The atmosphere is expected to react to these effects in the coming months, with irregular rainfall and below-average precipitation expected in the western region of Santa Catarina. Currently, the region is experiencing a weak to moderate drought, mainly in the western and southern regions, due to irregular precipitation in the second half of 2024.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[defesacivil.sc.gov.br](https://www.defesacivil.sc.gov.br/2025/01/10/nota-meteorologica-sdc-sc-e-epagri-condicoes-de-la-nina-aumentam-com-o-resfriamento-do-oceano-pacifico-equatorial/)\n\n**La Nina and El Nino: What to Expect in 2025**\nScientists predict that La Nina conditions may emerge in 2025, slightly cooling global temperatures, but the planet is still warming at an alarming rate. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2024 will be the hottest year on record, with average global temperatures exceeding the 1.5\u00b0C target set by the Paris Agreement. The WMO attributes the 2024 temperature record to the El Nino event, which has been affecting global temperatures. However, La Nina may emerge in 2025, potentially breaking the 2024 temperature record. Despite this, the Met Office predicts that 2025 will be one of the three hottest years on record. El Nino and La Nina are two opposing climate conditions that occur in the Pacific Ocean and affect global weather patterns. La Nina is characterized by stronger trade winds that push warm waters towards Australia and Southeast Asia, cooling the surface temperature. The WMO predicts that La Nina conditions may emerge from November 2024 to February 2025, but its cooling effect on global temperatures will be weak and short-lived. Meteorologists say that even with La Nina, global temperatures will continue to rise due to increasing greenhouse gases. 'We have seen an extraordinary series of high global land and sea surface temperatures since June 2023. A short-term cooling due to La Nina would not change the long-term trajectory of rising global temperatures,' said the WMO. Professor Adam Scaife of the Met Office notes that 2025 will be a year where El Nino's warming effect is not dominant, and global temperatures should be cooler. However, he adds that 2025's temperature predictions are extremely high compared to 2016, which was a record-breaking El Nino year.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: December 31, 2024 09:23 AM\nSource:[euronews](https://tr.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/12/31/teyit-el-nino-ve-la-nina-nedir-ve-2025-yilinda-iklimi-etkileyebilirler-mi)\n\n**Chile Recalculates La Ni\u00f1a's Arrival and Anticipates a Mild Summer**\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), there is a 59% probability that La Ni\u00f1a will develop in January 2025 and last until May. However, the Chilean Meteorological Service (DMC) notes that all previous forecasts have failed, and the equatorial Pacific Ocean has not cooled enough to confirm the phenomenon. The DMC's meteorologist, Catalina Cort\u00e9s, stated, 'Conditions are still favorable for La Ni\u00f1a's development, but it will be weak and short-lived.' They estimate that it could appear as early as February 2025, but with a lower frequency than a typical El Ni\u00f1o year, and will likely result in a mild summer. Cort\u00e9s also warned that, with or without La Ni\u00f1a, global warming and climate change will continue to drive high temperatures, and extreme heat this summer 2024-2025 will primarily affect areas with peak temperatures above 40\u00b0C, such as Los Andes and Llay Llay.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 01:08 PM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/sociedad/2024/12/28/en-chile-recalculan-la-llegada-del-fenomeno-de-la-nina-anticipan-un-verano-templado-1177457.html)\n\n**OMM Releases Seasonal Forecast for Next Three Months**\nThe World Meteorological Organization (OMM) has released its seasonal forecast for the next three months, which is crucial for decision-makers to anticipate the potential impacts of El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a phenomena on tropical regions. The current conditions are neutral, but there is a 55% probability of a transition to La Ni\u00f1a conditions between December 2024 and February 2025. In February to April 2025, conditions are expected to return to neutral ENSO. The global temperature is expected to remain above normal, with a 55% probability of La Ni\u00f1a conditions in the Pacific Ocean. The OMM's last update indicates that surface temperatures will remain above normal in all ocean basins, except for the eastern Pacific Ocean, consistent with the expected weak La Ni\u00f1a conditions. Precipitation forecasts for December 2024 to February 2025 are consistent with the increase in the positive temperature gradient from east to west, typically observed during La Ni\u00f1a. 'Even if a La Ni\u00f1a phenomenon appears, its short-term cooling effect will be insufficient to counterbalance the warming effect of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which will be a record this year.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 24, 2024 06:00 AM\nSource:[tempo.pt](https://www.tempo.pt/noticias/actualidade/temperatura-e-precipitacao-para-os-proximos-tres-meses-eis-as-previsoes-a-nivel-global-da-omm.html)\n\n**Azerbaijan to Experience Decrease in Temperatures and Increase in Precipitation by February 2025**\nAccording to S\u0259id S\u0259f\u0259rov, the head of the Geographical Institute, the expected decrease in temperatures and increase in precipitation in Azerbaijan by February 2025 is related to the activation of the 'La-Nino' phenomenon. 'La-Nino' is a positive phase of the 'Southern Oscillation Index' in the equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean. This phenomenon can cause a decrease in temperatures and an increase in precipitation in various regions of the world. S\u0259f\u0259rov explained that the 'La-Nino' phenomenon occurs when the atmospheric pressure in Darwin is lower than in Tahiti, causing winds to blow from east to west and warm ocean waters to move towards the west coast of South America. This process can lead to a decrease in global temperatures. S\u0259f\u0259rov also stated that the expected activation of 'La-Nino' will not have a significant impact on the current global warming trend. According to the institute's forecast, Azerbaijan can expect a decrease in temperatures and an increase in precipitation by February 2025. 'This is more related to the movement of air masses,' S\u0259f\u0259rov said. 'The current situation shows that the temperatures are decreasing a bit faster than usual, which is related to the activation of 'La-Nino'.
