This achievement marks the second instance of a private company landing on the moon, following Intuitive Machines' 'Odysseus' in 2024. The Blue Ghost lander was launched on January 15 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. After 45 days, the lander touched down on the moon's north-eastern side, in the 'Mare Crisium' lava plain. Firefly Aerospace CEO Jason Kim stated, 'Firefly is literally and figuratively above the moon. Our Blue Ghost lunar lander has now established a permanent presence on the moon's surface.' The Blue Ghost will spend the next lunar day (14 Earth days) exploring the moon's surface, which is covered in dust. The lander is equipped with 10 NASA-developed scientific instruments, designed to collect data for future human missions to the moon. The instruments will test methods for reducing dust on the moon's surface, collect samples of the moon's soil, and drill into the moon's subsurface. The Blue Ghost will also capture images of the lunar eclipse on March 14 and the sunset on the moon's surface on March 16, collecting data on the behavior of the moon's dust after sunset.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 11:30 AM\nSource:[GIZMODO JAPAN\uff08\u30ae\u30ba\u30e2\u30fc\u30c9\u30fb\u30b8\u30e3\u30d1\u30f3\uff09](https://www.gizmodo.jp/2025/03/fireflys-blue-ghost-lander-is-on-the-moon-heres-what-to-expect-next.html)\n\n**Three Killed in Powerful Storms Sweeping Through the United States**\nThree people were killed on Wednesday, March 5, 2025, due to powerful storms that swept through the United States. The storms caused roofs to be torn off buildings in a small town in Oklahoma before heading east, prompting tornado warnings near the eastern coast. At the same time, the storms brought heavy snow to the Midwest, and dry winds sparked wildfires in Texas. In California, weather experts warned of an incoming storm from the Pacific Ocean that will bring heavy rain and snow to parts of the state and western regions by Friday. California Governor Gavin Newsom warned that the storm could bring debris to areas recently affected by wildfires. Meanwhile, tornado warnings were issued in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and Virginia.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 10:36 AM\nSource:[https://www.tuniscope.com](https://www.tuniscope.com/ar/article/401984/arabe/actu-arabe/3-303511)\n\n**Florida to Spring Forward: Daylight Saving Time Change in 2025**\nFlorida will experience the change to daylight saving time in 2025, with clocks springing forward one hour on Sunday, March 9, 2025, at 2:00 a.m. This change will benefit cities like Miami and Orlando, where the increased natural light will boost tourism and outdoor activities. The change will occur in cities such as Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Jacksonville, and Tallahassee, marking the beginning of daylight saving time. According to the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2007, the primary goal of daylight saving time is to reduce energy consumption and promote outdoor activities and tourism. As of now, 20 states have passed laws supporting the permanent adoption of daylight saving time, but any change would require Congressional approval. As stated by former President Donald Trump, 'I'm a big believer in daylight saving time,' and expressed his support for making it permanent in 2019. However, no final decision has been made.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 08:47 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/estados-unidos/2025/03/05/cuando-cambia-la-hora-en-florida-fecha-y-ciudades-del-estado-que-adelantaran-el-reloj-por-una-hora-en-2025-lrtmus-217990)\n\n**Florida Gubernatorial Candidate Proposes Adding Bitcoin to State Portfolio**\nUS Representative Byron Donalds, who is running for governor of Florida in 2026, has expressed his intention to include Bitcoin in the state's financial portfolio. Donalds, who has the support of President Donald Trump, believes that this initiative could position Florida as a major global financial hub. According to Donalds, 'Florida will become the financial hub of the world, not just the United States, but the planet.' He aims to leverage the growing digital assets sector in Miami-Dade to strengthen the state's economic resilience and ability to face future economic crises. Donalds plans to capitalize on the digital assets boom to solidify Florida's financial position. He stated, 'One of the measures I would like to implement with the state's portfolio is probably including Bitcoin as a component of the state's financial portfolio. It has proven to be an excellent store of value and wealth. If we integrate it into the state's balance, it could help us navigate any future economic storm.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 03:22 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/candidato-a-gobernador-de-florida-propone-incluir-bitcoin-en-la-cartera-estatal-93CH-3044424)\n\n**DeSantis' Address: Florida to Punish Undocumented Immigrants Entering the State**\nFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis delivered the state's address on Tuesday, marking the start of the 2025 legislative sessions in Florida. DeSantis spoke about the main issues that will define his administration this year, including immigration. He reiterated that Florida is not a sanctuary state and emphasized that the state has been a leader in enforcing President Donald Trump's policies on this matter. DeSantis stated, 'Ending the crisis of illegal migration once and for all. No state has done more or done it faster than us in Florida. There is legislation that punishes the entry of (undocumented) immigrants into the state. The days of the 'catch and release' policy are over, and all law enforcement agencies, state and local, have the duty to continue these efforts.' DeSantis also briefly mentioned the topic of car and property insurance.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 11:53 PM\nSource:[LaPatilla.com](https://www.lapatilla.com/2025/03/04/lo-que-dijo-desantis-sobre-castigar-a-inmigrantes-indocumentados-que-entren-a-florida/)\n\n**Map shows states with the most layoffs in 2025**\nAccording to WARN notices, California has led the number of layoffs scheduled for 2025, with 13,216 announced layoffs, followed by Texas with 4,220 and Florida with 3,915. Tech giants like Meta and Google are contributing to the high number of layoffs in California. Other states with significant layoffs include Washington, Illinois, Ohio, New York, Georgia, and South Carolina. Experts attribute the layoffs to shifting consumer demand, industry challenges, and the impact of artificial intelligence on jobs. Kevin Thompson, a finance expert, said, 'Texas and California have booming tech-heavy sectors that experience boom-and-bust cycles.' Bryan Driscoll, an HR consultant, stated, 'Tech has been bleeding jobs for over a year now, and the trend isn't stopping.' Michael Ryan, a finance expert, added, 'AI is eating jobs for breakfast, automation is redesigning entire departments, and companies are getting lean and mean.' The retail, banking, and aerospace industries are likely experiencing the most job losses as consumers cut back on spending. Thompson warned, 'When people are uncertain, they save instead of spend -- hurting our economy, which is two-thirds consumption based.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 10:14 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-states-having-most-layoffs-2025-2039603)\n\n**Private Spacecraft 'Blue Ghost' Lands on the Moon**\nThe private spacecraft 'Blue Ghost' landed on the Moon on March 2, 2025, after traveling over 4.5 million kilometers from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. According to NASA, the spacecraft took approximately 14 days to reach Earth orbit and then another 4 days to reach the Moon. Janet Petro, interim administrator of NASA, said, 'This incredible achievement demonstrates how NASA and US companies are leading the way in space exploration for the benefit of all, while also ensuring the safety of our spacecraft instruments for future human exploration, both short-term and long-term.' The mission, part of the Artemis program, was selected through the NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative and was carried out in collaboration with Firefly Aerospace. The 'Blue Ghost' module sent back impressive photos of the lunar surface, which will help prepare for future NASA exploration.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 05:28 PM\nSource:[caracol.com.co](https://caracol.com.co/2025/03/04/nave-privada-blue-ghost-aterrizo-en-la-luna-cuanto-tardo-publican-impresionantes-fotos/)\n\n**Three Civilian Aircraft Mistakenly Enter No-Fly Zone Above Mar-a-Lago, Intercepted by F-16 Fighter Jets**\nOn March 1, 2025, three civilian aircraft mistakenly entered a temporary no-fly zone above the 'Mar-a-Lago' estate in Florida, according to the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched F-16 fighter jets to intercept the aircraft and escort them out of the no-fly zone. The no-fly zone was in place because US President Trump was playing golf nearby. According to reports, the civilian aircraft entered the no-fly zone at 11:05 am, 12:10 pm, and 12:50 pm, and the NORAD dispatched F-16 fighter jets to intercept them. The F-16 fighter jets used flares to 'attract the attention of the pilots and communicate with them,' according to NORAD. The flares were extinguished quickly and posed no danger to people on the ground.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 02, 2025 02:53 AM\nSource:[Liberty Times Net](https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/world/breakingnews/4966827)\n\n**Pentagon issues announcement about egg-shaped UFO case**\nThe Pentagon has confirmed it is investigating claims made by a government contractor, Jake Barber, that he retrieved a crashed 'egg-shaped' UFO. Barber, a chief helicopter pilot in California, came out as a whistleblower in January, saying he piloted helicopters during secret missions to collect alien technology. The US Department of Defense (DoD) is now looking into the case, adding it to 21 other UAP (unidentified anomalous phenomena) investigations. The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) received 757 cases of UAP encounters from US authorities, including 272 incidents that occurred prior to 2023 but had never been reported publicly. Investigative journalist Ross Coulthart noted that the new director of AARO, Dr. Jon T. Kosloski, has limited power to reveal government secrets, and that the Pentagon has a history of being secretive about UFOs. Coulthart believes the US government has been covering up its retrieval of 'non-human technology' for decades. Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida has been appointed to lead a new task force focused on declassifying 'government secrets' - including the origin of UFOs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 05:43 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14431831/pentagon-bombshell-announcement-egg-shaped-ufo-case.html)\n\n**US Air Force Pilot Reports UFO Sighting, Describes Object as 'Football-Sized'**\nA US Air Force pilot, identified as 'Troy 21', reported seeing a UFO while flying a secret mission over California airspace on September 17, 2023. According to the pilot, the object was 'about the size of a football, a deep gray, cylindrical object' that passed about 10 feet below his wing. The pilot described the object as 'very strange' and said he couldn't determine if it was a drone or not. Radar data showed a second object appearing 40 seconds later, 60 miles away, which, if it was the same object, would have been traveling at over 2 Mach (twice the speed of sound). Experts say that some military and civilian drones can reach such high speeds, but it's not common. The incident has been reported to the National UFO Reporting Center.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 23, 2025 12:48 AM\nSource:[\u6771\u65b9\u7db2 \u99ac\u4f86\u897f\u4e9e\u6771\u65b9\u65e5\u5831](https://www.orientaldaily.com.my/news/international/2025/02/23/714477)\n\n**Leaked recording: US Air Force pilot reports UFO over California in 2024**\nA US Air Force pilot reported a UFO sighting in September 2024 while flying a Beechcraft 350 in California. The pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' described a football-sized, dark, cylindrical object passing underneath his wing. The incident was reported to the National UFO Reporting Center. Radar systems on the plane detected an object 60 miles away, but it is unclear if it was the same object. The UFO's speed exceeded Mach 2 within two minutes, which is not possible for most drones. This incident is one of several recent UFO sightings, including a temporary suspension of operations at the Gaziantep Airport in Turkey due to a reported UFO sighting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 07:16 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/world/shows/story/the-buzz-leaked-recording-us-air-force-pilot-reports-ufo-over-california-in-2024-glbs-2683725-2025-02-23)\n\n**Fighter jet pilot spots 'football-sized' UFO in leaked audio clip**\nA US fighter pilot, identified as Troy 21, reported seeing a 'football-sized' cylindrical UFO fly past his plane during a secret mission near Los Angeles, California, on September 17, 2024. According to a leaked audio recording, the pilot said the object was 'dark grey' and 'cylindrical' and passed just 10ft under his wing. The pilot shared his sighting with local air traffic controllers, who initially acknowledged the sighting but later downplayed it, saying 'that's all taken care of now.' Ben Hansen, host of the Discovery+ show 'UFO Witness,' analyzed the footage and concluded that the object could not have been a drone due to its high speed, exceeding Mach 2 in two minutes. The sighting comes after the Pentagon's latest report on UFOs, which revealed hundreds of new sightings of unidentified and unexplained aerial phenomena, but found no evidence of extraterrestrial origin.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 07:49 PM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/air-force-pilot-spots-football-34727834)\n\n**\"Right Under My Wing\": US Air Force Pilot Claims UFO Sighted At 20,000 Feet**\nA US Air Force pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' reported a UFO sighting while flying at 20,000 feet over California in September 2024. The pilot described a dark grey, cylindrical object, about the size of a football, passing close to his wing. The incident was captured in leaked audio and has sparked debate over unidentified aerial phenomena. The pilot's onboard radar detected an object at a distance, which reappeared 60 miles away within 40 seconds, suggesting speeds exceeding Mach 2. This sighting bears similarities to a report by former NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao, who encountered two metallic, cylindrical objects while flying over Texas. Chiao described them as smooth, propulsion-less orbs that passed just ten feet beneath his wings. The incident was logged with the National UFO Reporting Center, adding to the growing list of unexplained aerial encounters.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 11:22 AM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-air-force-pilot-reports-close-encounter-with-mysterious-football-sized-object-7761109)\n\n**US Air Force pilot reveals encounter with UFO during secret mission**\nA US Air Force pilot, identified as 'Troy 21,' reported a close encounter with a UFO while on a secret mission over California on September 17, 2024. The pilot's voice was heard on a recording of local air traffic control, where he described the object as a 'dark gray cylindrical object' no bigger than a football that passed underneath his wing. The UFO was traveling at a high speed, estimated to be Mach 2, and was seen again 60 miles away from the aircraft. Former FBI agent Ben Hansen, a UFO expert, analyzed the recording and concluded that the chances of the object being a drone were unlikely. Hansen noted that the incident raises serious concerns, especially since the object passed so close to a manned airplane in controlled airspace. The incident has sparked renewed interest in the possibility of alien life visiting Earth, with some government officials, including Florida congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, calling for the truth to be exposed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 08:12 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14417603/US-Air-Force-pilot-reveals-encounter-UFO-secret-mission-California.html)\n\n**Florida is the USA\u2019s top economy. Here\u2019s why**\nFlorida is the top economy in the USA, with a GDP ranking 14th globally. The state offers a first-class education system, a market of over 23 million residents, and a base for established industries such as aviation, aerospace, data centers, medical and life sciences, and sustainable technologies. Citadel, a successful hedge fund, has relocated to Miami, and Apple has leased office space in Miami-Dade. A wave of investment has seen US hedge funds, private equity firms, and investment banks set up shop across the state, tapping into Florida's pro-business policies and warm weather. International business is keen on Florida, with the state consistently ranking fourth for foreign direct investment (FDI) in the US between 2019 and 2023. Florida's non-farm employment grew by 2.2% in the 12 months to March 2024, outpacing the US as a whole. The state's logistics and transport infrastructure serve as a compelling reason for businesses to expand in the state, with 15 deepwater seaports, 19 major commercial airports, and 2,756 miles of rail track. Florida's foreign trade zone reduces operational costs and overheads, making it ripe for further foreign direct investment (FDI). According to GlobalData, between 2019 and 2024 more than 620 companies announced or opened an operation in Florida, creating more than 47,000 jobs with a total project value of over $22 billion.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 10:58 AM\nSource:[investmentmonitor.ai](https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/sponsored/florida-is-the-usas-top-economy-heres-why/)\n\n**Mysterious Light Sightings Continue in the US, But Most Likely Explained by Drones and Government Aircraft**\nMysterious light sightings in the skies over the eastern coast of the United States, which dominated the headlines at the end of last year, continued to occur in the first weeks of 2025, albeit at a lower scale. According to a report by Enigma Labs, released on Monday (27), at least 54 records were made in January, as reported by Gizmodo. Of these, 48% were in the state of New York, which, along with New Jersey, account for 61% of the records this month. While there is no definitive explanation for the phenomenon, people who believe they are seeing alien spacecraft may be disappointed. According to the publication, the most likely explanations for the phenomenon are common drones piloted by citizens and government-controlled aircraft conducting tests. It is also not ruled out that sightings include aircraft developed by companies contracted by government agencies and the use of advanced drones operated by rival nations of the US. Another possibility for the reports of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) is the combination of two or more of these hypotheses. In a statement released last month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said it had not identified 'anything unusual' in the cases investigated. The report was signed jointly with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the US Department of Defense (DoD). The agency analyzed information on over 5,000 sightings between November and December and claims to have sent advanced detection technology to the regions with the most reports. Commercial drones, amateur drones, and police drones were some of the objects identified. According to the FBI, the reports include manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and star signals incorrectly identified as UFOs or drones. The report also states that the phenomenon does not pose a risk to national security or public safety in the civil airspace of the states with records.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 12:25 PM\nSource:[TecMundo](https://www.tecmundo.com.br/ciencia/401913-ovnis-ou-drones-novos-avistamentos-de-luzes-misteriosas-sao-registrados-nos-eua.htm)\n\n**US Congressman Claims Evidence of Alien Underwater Bases**\nUS Representative Tim Burchett stated that there is evidence of an unidentified object moving at hundreds of kilometers per hour underwater, suggesting that extraterrestrials may have underwater bases on Earth. Burchett mentioned that he was told 'something is moving at hundreds of kilometers per hour underwater, as big as a football field', according to an interview with former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz. This is not the first time Burchett has made claims about the US government hiding evidence of extraterrestrial life, having previously requested an investigation into the possibility of extraterrestrial spacecraft in 2023. However, the Pentagon released a report in March 2024 stating that there is no evidence of the existence of UFOs, attributing many sightings to weather balloons, spy planes, satellites, and other normal activities. Burchett, known for his claims of government cover-ups, believes that the vastness of the universe allows for the possibility of extraterrestrial life, citing 'the vastness of God's great universe'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 02:04 PM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/mundo/2025/1/26/congresista-estadounidense-afirma-que-hay-una-nave-alienigena-en-el-oceano-1183540.html)\n\n**A private US spacecraft headed to the moon captures a glorious view of Earth**\nA private U.S. spacecraft, Blue Ghost, launched by Firefly Aerospace, has captured stunning images of Earth one week into its flight.

He said, 'Everyone had a theory about what it could be - fireworks, meteors, drones, or UFOs. We relaxed once we found out what happened.' Meanwhile, SpaceX launched two spacecraft, one from the US and one from Japan, to the Moon on the previous day. The spacecraft, which were launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, will conduct research on the Moon's surface. The Japanese company Ispace's 'Hakuto-R' spacecraft, which successfully entered the Moon's orbit on March 21, is expected to land on the Moon's surface on April 26. However, Ispace announced that the spacecraft lost contact with its Tokyo control center during the descent phase, suggesting that it may have crashed. NASA later confirmed that the wreckage of the 'Hakuto-R' spacecraft was found in four large craters on May 25. The spacecraft was launched on December 2022 from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in the US.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 05:47 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/dunya/abd-de-cekilen-goruntu-heyecanlandirdi-urkutucu-18270873-haberi/)\n\n**UFO Sighting? Florida Flight Crew Spots \"Strange, Glowing Object\" At 45,000 Feet Over The Bahamas**\nA private Surjet plane crew witnessed a bizarre phenomenon while flying over the Bahamas at 45,000 feet. According to Cassandra Martin, a flight attendant, the crew saw strange, glowing orbs that transformed from white to green and had an 'electric field' around them. The object accompanied their plane for approximately 45 minutes before vanishing into the darkness. Martin described the object's 'zig-zag' movements and high altitude, which effectively eliminate the likelihood that it was a drone or a weather balloon. 'It started as white and then it just got green and almost like an electric some type of energy around it,' Martin said. 'I don't know what it was, and then I zoomed in as much as the phone allowed me to. And the object was white, and it turned slightly green, almost kind of like it had an electric field around it of some sort, and it stayed with us for about 45 minutes and then we didn't see it again,' she added. The incident occurred on December 23 as the crew flew back to Fort Lauderdale on an empty plane. 'I think we were astonished, and it was something that you really can't explain but I don't have the qualifications to know what that is,' Martin explained. 'Was it a little bit eerie? Yes, because again, we were pretty high up and whatever we saw was even higher than us and it had the capabilities just to zigzag and change colour, so that was a little daunting, to say the least,' she said. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2025 05:14 AM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/ufo-sighting-florida-flight-crew-spots-strange-glowing-object-at-45-000-feet-over-the-bahamas-7454858)\n\n**Moment private jet crew spot UFO in night skies over Florida**\nCassandra Martin, a flight attendant for private air service Surjet, captured footage of a mysterious spherical object flying above her plane on December 23. The object, which was thousands of feet above the Bahamas, was described as a 'rounded blur of white light' that faded into a green color with a circular halo surrounding it. Martin said the object moved in zigzag patterns and stayed with the plane for about 45 minutes. Defense expert Bryan Bender said the video is 'compelling' and similar to other cases of unidentified aerial phenomena reported by military pilots. Bender emphasized the importance of investigating such sightings for national security and aviation safety. This sighting comes after a similar incident was reported on New Year's Day at Fort Campbell, where an anonymous user captured footage of a 'bright orange light' hovering over the military base.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 03:01 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14270831/private-jet-crew-spherical-ufo-night-skies-fort-lauderdale.html)\n\n**UFO sighting? Fort Lauderdale flight crew spots something strange in the sky**\nA flight attendant and two pilots on a private air service reported seeing a strange object in the sky while flying over the Bahamas on December 23. The object, described as white and then green with an electric field-like aura, was seen for about 45 minutes at an altitude of 43,000 feet. The sighting was reported to Miami air traffic control, who asked the crew to identify the object. Defense expert Bryan Bender, who has investigated similar cases, believes the video and testimony are compelling and suggest that the object may be an unidentified anomalous phenomenon (UAP). Bender notes that the Pentagon has an office that investigates such sightings, and it's imperative for national security and aviation safety to determine what these objects are. The flight attendant, Cassandra Martin, described the experience as 'a little daunting' but also 'fascinating'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 12:38 AM\nSource:[nbcmiami.com](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/ufo-sighting-fort-lauderdale-flight-crew-spots-something-strange-in-the-sky/3511543/)\n\n",

Initial assessments ranged from 10% to 45%, with factors such as high air traffic, military presence, cultural interest, and historical trends influencing their predictions. In phase 2, after reviewing news articles, experts adjusted their probabilities slightly, with most ending up between 20% and 45%. Reinforcing factors included Florida's high tourism and air traffic during spring break, and its strong aerospace industry presence. However, challenges included strong competition from states like California and Texas, and potential disruptions from weather conditions. Overall, the revised probabilities suggest a moderate likelihood of Florida leading in UFO sightings by pilots, with a general consensus around a 20% to 45% chance.",
