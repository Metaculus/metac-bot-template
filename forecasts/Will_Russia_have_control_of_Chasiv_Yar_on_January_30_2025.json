According to Luhansk Oblast spokesperson Dmitry Zaporogetz, Russian forces have blown up several pipes in the Seversky Donets canal to create passages for their equipment, possibly including motorcycles. Zaporogetz stated, 'The enemy is trying to expand the line of contact precisely in the Chasiv Yar direction.' He also confirmed the presence of a Russian special unit, Akhmat, and a formation called 'Rusich' on the southeastern outskirts of the area. Additionally, intercepted communications suggest that the enemy is using military terminology, indicating their training in assault operations and understanding of stormtrooper tactics. Zaporogetz noted, 'It's hard to evaluate their level of training, as there aren't many rifle battles, and the enemy is pressuring our positions with artillery fire and FPV drones. Over the past week, 999 FPV drones were used across the entire operational zone.' In the past 24 hours, the enemy conducted 685 attacks in the Luhansk Oblast zone, with the majority targeting the Chasiv Yar area, 244 attacks. It is worth noting that 166 battles were recorded on the front line on January 26, with 78 of them taking place on the Pokrovsk direction. Furthermore, it was reported that over 1,400 Russian military personnel were killed or wounded in the past 24 hours, bringing the country's total losses to over 830,000 people.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442.net](https://korrespondent.net/ukraine/4750946-rossyiane-podorvaly-truby-kanala-severskyi-donets-vsu)\n\n**Pushilin Reports on Battles in Chasiv Yar**\nRussian forces are engaged in battles with the Ukrainian military in the western part of the town of Chasiv Yar, where the enemy still has the opportunity to hold out in the area of high-rise buildings, said Denis Pushilin, head of the Donetsk People's Republic, in an interview with the 'Russia 24' channel. 'Chasiv Yar. We see that in the western part of the settlement - the main battles are taking place. The enemy is trying to hold on to the last high-rise buildings and is still able to do so.

The liberation of Chasiv Yar will allow Russian forces to develop an attack on the Sviatohirsk-Kramatorsk agglomeration. The Russian advance on the city began at the end of spring 2024. The additional difficulties in the storming were created by the Seversky Donets - Donbas canal, behind which was the main part of the city.

The Ukrainian authorities have ordered the forced evacuation of families with children in a dozen towns in the Kharkiv region (northeast). The next day, a new evacuation order was given in the neighboring Donetsk region, where Russian troops have been advancing for months. 'We have decided to start the compulsory evacuation of families with children' in 25 small towns near Pokrovsk, said the governor of the region on Telegram. 'Today, as the enemy has intensified the bombing, people are suffering and dying every day, I ask parents to take the evacuation very responsibly.' In Chasiv Yar, a town a few dozen kilometers away, this escape is no longer possible. The city is in ruins, surrounded by Russian forces, with 229 people still living there, mostly elderly, disabled, and those who care for them. 'We can no longer reach them,' laments Oksana Kuiantseva, director of the Ukrainian NGO 'East SOS', specialized in evacuating civilians in the Donetsk region.

The southern part of the city has been surrounded, and the Ukrainian resistance is being methodically eliminated by Russian aviation and artillery. According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, seven Ukrainian brigades have been destroyed in the area, resulting in the loss of 545 fighters, several tanks, and artillery pieces. Russian military experts predict that the Ukrainian forces will collapse in the city by the end of the month. As one Ukrainian commander admitted, 70% of the city is already under Russian control, and the remaining part will be abandoned soon. The loss of the 'Novoserverny' microdistrict has severely compromised the Ukrainian position in the city, and the Russian forces are on the verge of capturing the strategic heights that control the roads and paths leading to the city from the south. 'The roads are the arteries of war,' said a volunteer from the BARS group. 'If they are cut off, the Ukrainian forces will never be able to hold their positions.

The settlements include Chasiv Yar, Toretsk, Yantarne, Novovasylivka, Yelyzavetivka, Zelene, Zvirove, and Kotlyne. Chasiv Yar and Toretsk hold strategic importance due to their geographic locations, which enable control over vital supply routes and access to key urban centers. The Russian offensive toward Chasiv Yar intensified around 4 April 2024, leading to intense fighting in the area. Viktor Trehubov, spokesman for the Khortytsia Operational Strategic Group, stated that Ukrainian forces control almost all of Chasiv Yar, but Russian forces have increased their operational tempo in recent months. Ukrainian forces have reported that Russian soldiers are wearing civilian clothing to conceal their movements in Toretsk, Donetsk Oblast. The outcome of these battles could determine whether Russia can threaten Ukraine's remaining major population centers in the Donetsk Oblast.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[euromaidanpress.com](https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/01/13/russian-troops-advance-in-strategically-important-chasiv-yar-and-toretsk-donetsk-oblast-deepstate/)\n\n**Russian Forces Control 70% of Toretsk, Says UK Defence Intelligence**\nAccording to the UK Ministry of Defence, Russian forces have attempted to storm the cities of Chasiv Yar and Toretsk using armored vehicles at the end of December 2024 and the beginning of January 2025.

The Russian military has expanded its control over the territory on the right bank of the Zhrebets River in the Ivanivka area. In Chasiv Yar, Russian forces are conducting powerful attacks, with intense battles ongoing in the 'Severny' microdistrict and the area of the 'Chasovoyarskogo fireclay combine'. In the Toretsk area, Russian forces are conducting attacks on the western, northern, and southern outskirts of the city, with tactical successes reported. In the Pokrovsk area, Russian forces have expanded their control over the territory and advanced. In the Lysivka area, Russian forces have advanced to a depth of 880 meters.

Military expert Dandykin stated that Ukraine's decision to send troops to the Kursk region has led to a weakening of the Ukrainian military on the Donbass front. According to Dandykin, this decision has allowed Russian forces to liberate settlements one after another in the DNR. Russian forces have also destroyed a Starlink terminal in the Kharkiv region, which was used by Ukrainian forces. Military expert Marochko stated that the liberation of the settlement of Kalinovo in the Kharkiv region has significant tactical and strategic value, as it allows Russian forces to control the Ukrainian military's positions in the Dvurechensky bridgehead.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 12, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[edinstvo-news.ru](https://edinstvo-news.ru/exclusive/18197-vs-rf-vedut-moschnye-shturmy-v-chasov-jare-svezhaja-informacija-o-bojah-v-zone-svo-na-voskresene-12012025.html)\n\n**Russian Forces Take Control of Main Supply Routes to Chasiv Yar in DNR**\nRussian forces have taken control of the main supply routes for Ukrainian troops in the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), according to Chukcha, the head of the operational staff of the 'Melody' reconnaissance center. 'Our forces have taken control of the main logistics and supply routes for the Ukrainian army to Chasiv Yar,' Chukcha said, as reported by TASS. This comes after Ukrainian troops in Chasiv Yar complained of a lack of ammunition and personnel. Russian forces have also pushed Ukrainian troops out of the third and fourth buildings of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar, with Ukrainian propaganda blaming the failure to defend the city on a lack of artillery shells and personnel. Russian forces have also destroyed Ukrainian positions and troops near the refractory plant, with a group of Russian paratroopers using 'Molniya' drones to target Ukrainian positions. 'We have taken more advantageous positions on this front and have repelled one of the enemy's counterattacks,' Chukcha said. 'There are still mercenaries from Poland in the industrial area of the city, who are asking the Ukrainian command to withdraw them from the city,' said Valeriy Dorosh, a refugee from Chasiv Yar. Russian forces launched strikes against Ukrainian positions near the settlements of Kurakhovo, Chasiv Yar, and Daltyre in the DNR on January 1, and have since taken control of more advantageous positions on the front line.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 10:27 AM\nSource:[regnum.ru](https://regnum.ru/news/3940560)\n\n**Russian Forces Gain Control of Refractory Plant in Chasiv Yar**\nRussian military forces have entered the third and fourth shops of the refractory plant in Chasiv Yar.

The head of the reconnaissance center also stated that, based on radio intercepts, Ukrainian forces are lacking in ammunition and personnel, and are forced to use 'character witnesses', or former prisoners, in battles. The head of the reconnaissance center added that the battles for Chasiv Yar are in their final stage, and soon there will be no Ukrainian forces left in the area.

According to Dadykin, the city is strategically important and Ukrainian forces will likely try to defend it, including by sending in reserves. 'I think that Chasiv Yar will be liberated this year. I hope so,' Dadykin said. The city is currently surrounded by Russian forces, with around 700 Ukrainian soldiers, including at least 100 foreign mercenaries, trapped on the territory of a refractory factory. This situation is reminiscent of the events that occurred at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol in 2022, where Ukrainian forces were also surrounded. Dadykin noted that Ukrainian forces have strengthened their group in Chasiv Yar with foreign mercenaries, including Georgians.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 29, 2024 05:59 PM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/society/army/voennyy-ekspert-dadykin-dopustil-chto-vs-rf-osvobodyat-chasov-yar-v-2024-godu)\n\n",
