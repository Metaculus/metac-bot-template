Trump has already imposed tariffs on various imports, including a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 10% tariff on imports from China. He has also threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada, although this was put on hold after they agreed to help control the US border. Trump has also repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs on Europe, which could lead to a trade war if they respond. Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that he will hold a press conference on tariffs at 19:00 Danish time. He also stated that Thursday is 'the big day' for tariffs, and that it has been 'three fantastic weeks' in the White House. Trump's statements often cause volatility in the stock market, and two stock market experts are trying to profit from his comments in the latest issue of Ekstra Bladet's 'Store Penge'-portfolio.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 02:35 PM\nSource:[Ekstra Bladet](https://ekstrabladet.dk/penge/mere-toldkaos-paa-vej-trump-indkalder-til-pressemoede/10529116)\n\n**US to Impose Tariffs of Up to 50% on Steel and Aluminum from Canada and Mexico**\nThe United States has announced that it will impose tariffs of up to 50% on steel and aluminum from Canada and Mexico, according to the White House. This move is part of a trade war with several countries. The tariffs, which were initially set at 25% for all countries, will be increased to 50% for Mexico and Canada if they do not reach an agreement. The US President, Donald Trump, has cited 'national security' as the reason for the tariffs. Brazil, Argentina, and other countries that benefited from exemptions have lost their privileges. According to the US Commerce Administration, Brazil was the second-largest exporter of steel to the US from March 2024 to February 2025, with 3.7 million metric tons, followed by Mexico. Argentina was the sixth-largest exporter of aluminum to the US in 2024, with over 176,000 tons. The Argentine government estimates that the tariffs will not affect their goals, as they will continue to work on a free trade agreement. The Mexican government has asked Trump for 'common sense', saying that the tariffs are unjustified since the US sells more to Mexico than the other way around. The Brazilian government has also opted for caution, saying that they do not encourage or engage in trade wars, but consider the US measures 'counterproductive'. The White House has described Trump's actions as 'bold measures' to protect US industries, saying that the tariffs will protect national security and put American workers first.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 11:31 PM\nSource:[correiobraziliense.com.br](https://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/mundo/2025/02/7059575-eua-podem-impor-tarifas-de-ate-50-sobre-aco-e-aluminio-de-canada-e-mexico.html)\n\n**US to Impose 50% Tariff on Aluminum and Steel Imports from Mexico and Canada**\nThe United States will impose a 50% tariff on aluminum and steel imports from Mexico and Canada, in addition to a 25% tariff already announced on all imports from both countries. This higher tariff will take effect on March 12, 2025. The move aims to benefit the US manufacturing industry, but could lead to price increases in interconnected products, such as vehicles. According to a White House official, the 50% tariff is due to the 25% tariff on aluminum and steel being added to another 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods that will take effect on March 4, 2025. Trump has announced reciprocal tariffs and has imposed an additional 10% tariff on China, triggering retaliatory measures. The US imports nearly two-thirds of its aluminum from Canada, and Canada is the main source of steel imports to the US, followed by Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, and Vietnam. Trump's goal is to boost the US manufacturing industry, which has declined in recent years due to free trade agreements with other countries allowing cheaper materials to enter the country. However, this could lead to price increases in products such as vehicles, whose components cross the border multiple times before final assembly. Trump has called tariffs 'the most beautiful word in the dictionary' and has used them as a tool for negotiation to obtain concessions in trade, migration, and security.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 07:27 PM\nSource:[BioBioChile](https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/economia/actualidad-economica/2025/02/12/canada-y-mexico-pagaran-un-50-de-arancel-por-el-aluminio-y-acero-que-exporten-a-eeuu-dice-washington.shtml)\n\n**Canada Unlikely to Renegotiate Free Trade Agreement Before April, Says Dominic LeBlanc**\nCanadian Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc has dismissed the idea of starting renegotiation of the free trade agreement with the US immediately to avoid American tariffs. This idea was proposed by Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault to 'end the uncertainty'. LeBlanc stated that the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, has been tasked by President Donald Trump to review international trade agreements by April 1, 2025. 'We don't think it's realistic to advance the review of the free trade agreement before April 1,' LeBlanc said. 'If the Americans decide to do so, we will be very ready. We think it's an important moment to advance Canada's economic interests.' LeBlanc wants to focus on discussions to avoid tariffs and establish an economic agreement with the US. He also stated that Canada will not impose tariffs before the US does, but will respond firmly if tariffs are applied.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 03:05 PM\nSource:[journaldequebec.com](https://www.journaldequebec.com/2025/02/12/tarifs-douaniers-une-revision-hative-de-lalena-nest-pas-realiste-avant-avril-selon-dominic-leblanc)\n\n**Trump May Impose Tariffs on European Pharmaceuticals, Auto Industry**\nAccording to reports, 'despite Trump not giving a deadline, he still promised to strike the European pharmaceutical industry... who will be hit the hardest? Ireland may be particularly worried.' In 2023, the US became Ireland's largest buyer of exported goods, purchasing goods worth nearly 54 billion euros, including 36 types of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Trump's measures may also affect Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company known for producing the Ozempik drug. The website stated, 'the first tariff threat is aimed at Denmark because Denmark is unwilling to give up control of Greenland. Naturally, this will hit the country's most famous company... Novo Nordisk.' Additionally, the automotive industry, particularly German Volkswagen, may be severely affected by Trump's tariffs. Trump stated on February 1 that he would impose tariffs on EU goods because Brussels' attitude towards Washington is 'very bad.' The EU Commission representative stated on February 2 that the EU has no data on US tariffs on European goods, but is prepared to make a 'decisive response' in the event of tariffs being imposed.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 09:43 PM\nSource:[sputniknews.cn](https://sputniknews.cn/20250212/1064046078.html)\n\n**Scholz Threatens Quick EU Response to Trump's Tariffs**\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that the European Union can respond quickly to the new US tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. He emphasized that the EU is a strong economic area with its own tools to take necessary measures. Scholz stated, 'However, the goal should be to avoid maintaining tariffs in the end, whether on this side or the other. But if necessary, we can also impose our own tariffs.' The EU has not yet determined how it will respond to the US measures. The European Steel Association considered the new US tariffs a significant threat to production in the EU. US President Trump announced earlier that he would impose a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports to the US, stating that these tariffs would apply to all countries without exception. According to sources in the European Parliament, the EU's response will come on April 1, as European Parliament Trade Committee Chairman Bernd Lange said in Strasbourg, 'If we do not reach an agreement by March 12, we will of course continue negotiations, and tariffs will be imposed on April 1.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 08:23 PM\nSource:[rtarab.com](https://rtarab.com/%D8%B4%D9%88%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B3-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8/)\n\n**EU Threatens Counter-Tariffs on US Products if No Agreement by March 12**\nEU Trade Commissioner Bernd Lange stated, 'If we don't reach an agreement by March 12, we will naturally continue to negotiate, but from April 1, these counter-tariffs will be implemented.' The EU is considering imposing tariffs on US products such as jeans, bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, and peanut butter. This move is a response to the US tariffs on EU steel and aluminum exports. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, 'Unjust tariffs against the EU will not go unanswered - they will trigger determined and proportionate countermeasures.' The EU is currently assessing the scope of the measures ordered by Trump. However, they are open to negotiations to find mutually beneficial solutions. Austrian businesses, such as voestalpine and AMAG, are also affected by the US tariffs. Austrian Economy Minister Martin Kocher expressed support for EU countermeasures, stating that the US tariffs contradict 'the spirit of free and fair trade.' Trump has announced plans to introduce reciprocal tariffs within the next two days, adjusting the tariff level to that of each trading partner.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 06:11 PM\nSource:[krone.at](https://www.krone.at/3686731)\n\n**Trump Imposes 25% Tariff on Steel and Aluminum Imports**\nUS President Donald Trump has signed a decree imposing a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports starting from March 4, 2025. The measure aims to protect the American steel industry and reduce dependence on foreign steel and aluminum. Trump stated that the tariff will be applied 'without exceptions' to all countries, affecting their exports to the US. The decision may impact countries that export steel and aluminum to the US, such as Brazil, which was the second-largest supplier of steel to the US in 2024. According to US Commerce Department data, the US imports a significant portion of its steel and aluminum from countries like Canada, Mexico, and Brazil. Trump emphasized the importance of maintaining these industries within the US to ensure the recovery of the American manufacturing sector. He also announced that the US government will evaluate the imposition of additional tariffs on sectors such as cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. The new tariff may affect the Brazilian economy, as the country's steel and aluminum exports to the US may be reduced, resulting in significant losses. The Brazilian government has not yet taken a formal stance on the issue, but the president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, has stated that the country will adopt 'reciprocity' if the US increases tariffs on Brazilian products, which may lead to new trade barriers against American imports. The Brazilian steel industry has not commented on the new tariff, but in the past, similar measures have had a significant impact on the sector, leading to the shutdown of furnaces and job losses. Some analysts believe that the tariff may be softened after discussions with affected countries, while others predict that the impact will be limited if global supply chains adjust quickly. The US has a history of imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum, with similar measures being implemented in 2002 and 2018, but with limited success in protecting the domestic industry.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 02:24 PM\nSource:[mixvale.com.br](https://www.mixvale.com.br/2025/02/11/trump-assina-decreto-que-impoe-tarifa-de-25-para-aco-e-aluminio-brasil-pode-ser-impactado/)\n\n**Trump Considers Tax on Danish Gold and Pharmaceuticals**\nUS President Donald Trump is considering imposing a tax on Danish gold, as well as on medicines, cars, and computer chips. According to Reuters, Trump made this announcement on Monday. This move comes as Trump has already imposed a 25% tax on steel and aluminum imports from all countries. If Trump follows through with his plans, it could potentially affect several Danish pharmaceutical companies. Trump did not mention a specific tax rate for medicines, cars, and computer chips. Several Danish pharmaceutical companies, including Novo Nordisk, have a significant presence in the US market. Denmark's export to the US increased to 366 billion kroner in 2024, making it the country's largest export market, according to Statistics Denmark. Allan S\u00f8rensen, chief economist at Dansk Industri, said that the export to the US has increased by 2.5 percentage points in the past year. 'There is a significant increase in the export of goods that do not cross the Danish border,' S\u00f8rensen wrote in a comment on Monday. 'This is largely due to the sale of medicines on the US market.' France has threatened to retaliate against Trump's tax on steel and aluminum, but Trump seems unfazed by potential reactions from other countries.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 01:51 PM\nSource:[folketidende.dk](https://folketidende.dk/udland/trump-overvejer-told-paa-dansk-guldaeg)\n\n**Sweden Arrests Person Suspected of Planning Terrorist Attack, Denmark Introduces Reusable Uniforms, and US Rejects EU Regulations on AI**\nA person suspected of planning a terrorist attack has been arrested by Swedish police near Stockholm. The Swedish Security Service, S\u00e4po, has released a statement saying that the person is suspected of planning a terrorist offense, participating in a terrorist organization, and preparing for or attempting murder. The case is related to violent Islamist extremism. Meanwhile, in Denmark, the city of S\u00f8nderborg is introducing reusable uniforms for most employees in the elderly care and all employees in dental care as part of its climate plan. The city aims to have 80% of its procurement agreements be sustainable by 2025. An investment platform, Nordnet, has been hit by a major security breach, where users have gained access to other people's accounts. Nordnet has confirmed the breach to Ekstra Bladet and DR Nyheder, saying that all users' accounts have been locked until the issue is resolved. The US is rejecting EU regulations on AI, with Vice President J.D. Vance saying that the US will maintain its leadership in AI. The US has also imposed a 25% tariff on EU steel and aluminum imports. In Japan, a government employee has lost a bag containing sensitive documents, including a list of 187 suspected narcotics smugglers and their addresses. The employee has been suspended pending an investigation. Denmark's population is expected to reach 6 million by 2024, with a growth rate of 0.53% in 2024. The country's population is expected to reach 6 million by 2028, but the growth rate is expected to be higher than previously thought. Ukraine has imposed restrictions on electricity use after a Russian attack on its gas infrastructure. The restrictions aim to prevent a collapse of the energy system. The US has announced plans to send a delegation to Ukraine, led by US Special Envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keth Kellogg. The delegation will work on a plan to end the war in Ukraine.

The plan includes the use of second-hand uniforms for employees in the elderly care and dental care services. The uniforms will be sourced from other municipalities or purchased new without being used. This move is part of the government's climate plan, which aims to make 80% of its procurement agreements sustainable by 2025.

Nordnet has confirmed the breach and is working to resolve the issue. The US government has imposed a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports from European countries, which has been met with criticism from the EU. The Danish population is expected to reach 6 million by 2024, according to the latest estimates from Statistics Denmark. The increase in population is mainly due to immigration, with 101,724 immigrants arriving in Denmark in 2024, compared to 69,467 emigrants. The Transparency International corruption index has ranked Denmark as the least corrupt country in the world for the seventh consecutive year, with a score of 90 out of 100. The Ukrainian government has imposed restrictions on the use of electricity after a Russian attack on its gas infrastructure. The US government has also announced plans to send a delegation to Ukraine, led by special envoy Keth Kellogg, to discuss the conflict. The delegation is expected to arrive in Ukraine soon, but no date has been announced. The US government has also announced plans to talk to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj in the coming week. The US government has not provided a plan for how the conflict in Ukraine can be ended. The Israeli government has announced that it will delay the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, citing concerns about the ceasefire agreement. The US government has criticized the delay, saying that it would lead to the annulment of the ceasefire agreement if the hostages are not released by Saturday.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:55 AM\nSource:[DR](https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/seneste/genbrug-rykker-ind-i-koege-kommune)\n\n**EU Responds to Trump's Tariff Decision, Denmark's Population Reaches Six Million**\nUrsula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, has expressed disappointment with Donald Trump's decision to impose a tariff on European steel and aluminum exports. She stated, 'I deeply regret the US decision to impose a tariff on European steel and aluminum exports.' The EU will not remain silent in the face of this decision and will take proportionate measures to protect its economic interests. Meanwhile, the population of Denmark is expected to reach six million in 2024, according to the latest estimates from Statistics Denmark. The country's population has grown by 0.53% in 2024, with a total of 31,485 people. The increase is attributed to immigration, with 101,724 people immigrating to Denmark in 2024, while 69,467 people emigrated. In other news, the Danish government has announced plans to reduce traffic congestion by encouraging people to arrive at work 10 minutes later than usual. The plan aims to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. Additionally, the Foreningen Spiseforstyrrelser og Selvskade (Eating Disorders and Self-Harm Association) has reported a 22% increase in calls related to eating disorders and self-harm in 2024, with 6,754 calls received. The association has also expanded its opening hours to provide more support to those in need. Furthermore, the Danish Meteorological Institute has warned of strong winds and low temperatures, with a chill factor making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The winds are expected to cause disruptions to traffic and ferry services, with the \u00c6r\u00f8f\u00e6rgerne and Fan\u00f8linjen announcing cancellations and delays.

The claim was later shared on Instagram and other social media platforms, but there is no record of Denmark announcing any such tariffs. The Danish government did not impose tariffs on US imports of the medication, and the claim confuses how tariffs work, which are placed on imported goods, not exported goods.

According to DI's geographical politics director Peter Dige Thagesen, the tariffs will lead to higher prices, inflation, and significant disruptions to global supply chains. Although the tariffs are currently only imposed on US neighbors and China, the EU is likely to become a target for retaliatory tariffs, which will affect the Danish economy. DI's analysis, based on data from the Oxford Economics Institute, suggests that if Mexico and Canada adopt similar tariffs, the US GDP could decline by up to 2% and nearly 900,000 jobs could be lost. If a trade war breaks out between the US and the EU, the Danish economy could be severely affected, with a potential GDP decline of 23 billion Danish kroner in 2027 and 6,000 job losses. Danish companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, are already feeling the impact. Lars Mansfeld-Gies, CEO of Real Coffee, said, 'Our 75% revenue comes from the US, and we are accelerating shipments and logistics to build local inventory and plan to establish a warehouse and subsidiary in the US to reduce the impact of tariffs. We are even considering setting up a subsidiary in the US to avoid tariff barriers.' Britt Meelby Jensen, CEO of Ambu, emphasized that the company has some US inventory and has not adjusted its strategy in response to the new tariffs, adopting a cautious approach to supply chain stability. Bo Lyb\u00e6k, CEO of GPV, said that the company is still observing the situation and will take the most appropriate action based on the development of the situation. DI believes that if the affected countries can respond effectively, these tariffs may be quickly revoked. However, companies still need to respond to market uncertainty and prepare for potential impacts.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 02:59 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=f2cf788f-b2d8-4da7-b1ac-0050834f3ba2)\n\n**Danish Prime Minister Warns of EU's Tough Response to US Tariffs**\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that the EU will have to give a very tough response if the Trump administration decides to impose tariffs. According to Frederiksen, this will affect not only businesses, but also ordinary citizens, workers in the US, Europe, Canada, Mexico, and other countries. As she said, 'But it's clear that if the US applies very strong pressure on the European market, we simply cannot do anything except respond very harshly.' The European currency continues to depreciate, setting a new record low against the US dollar on February 3. According to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the euro exchange rate fell to a level not seen since November 2022, reaching $1.0231. Experts note that the decline in the euro's value is linked to the US's introduction of trade tariffs against Canada, Mexico, and China. Analysts suggest that the European Union may become the next target of Washington's tariff policy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 12:02 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c](https://profile.ru/news/abroad/premer-danii-evrosojuzu-pridetsya-zhestko-otvetit-na-poshliny-ssha-1656918/)\n\n**Trump's Heated Phone Call with Danish PM: A Threat to Greenland's Independence?**\nUS President Donald Trump had a heated phone call with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen on January 15, 2025, just before his inauguration. Trump insisted that he was serious about taking control of Greenland. According to sources, Trump may use tariffs to pressure Denmark and even encourage Greenland to hold a referendum on independence and then form an alliance with the US. Frederiksen proposed more cooperation on mining and military bases, but after she stated that Greenland is not for sale, Trump's tone became aggressive and threatening. A source said, 'He was very decisive, giving a sense of a slap in the face, very intimidating.' Many European officials had previously thought that Trump's claim of taking Greenland was just a negotiating tactic, but this phone call has made them realize that the situation is more serious. A Danish former official revealed that Trump threatened to impose targeted tariffs on Denmark. Trump had previously threatened to impose tariffs on Denmark if they blocked his attempt to acquire Greenland, and even mentioned the possibility of using force. The White House National Security Council spokesperson said, 'President Trump has made it clear that, given Russia and China's active engagement in the Arctic region, Greenland's security and safety are crucial to the United States.' After the phone call, Denmark took a conciliatory approach, urging EU partners not to escalate the situation before it becomes clear. The EU's Foreign Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on January 27 did not include the Greenland issue. Paris Institute Professor Zaki Laidi said that if Trump decides to use economic measures such as tariffs to pressure Denmark, the EU is likely to retaliate with counter-tariffs. Laidi and other officials believe that Trump may not only pressure Denmark and the EU with tariffs, but also encourage Greenland to hold a referendum on independence and then form an alliance with the US. The EU is currently coordinating with Denmark to integrate their positions and understand Trump's true intentions. According to a 2009 agreement between Greenland and Denmark, Greenland can only declare independence after a national referendum is passed. Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede has hinted that a referendum may be held in conjunction with the parliamentary elections in April. Trump said that Greenland is 'absolutely necessary' for Western world security and that he believes the US can 'get it'.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 02:43 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202501270039.aspx)\n\n**US Tariffs to Redirect Trade Flow to Russia**\nAccording to Anastasia Prikalova, a lecturer at the Russian Economic University, the introduction of US tariffs will increase the supply of goods in Russia, which will help to curb domestic prices. She believes that Russian imports may shift from China to India, including smartphones, semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, and from Vietnam, including clothing, footwear, electronics, and household appliances. However, Prikalova notes that the existing restrictions on international transactions may complicate trade relations. 'The introduction of tariffs may trigger retaliatory measures from countries affected by this policy, leading to a new round of trade wars that will not only affect Russia but also other major economies, such as China and the EU,' said Oleg Ivanov, a senior lecturer at the Russian Economic University. US President Trump has announced plans to impose tariffs of 10% on Chinese goods and 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico, starting from February 1, 2025. He has also threatened to impose tariffs on goods from BRICS countries if they create a new currency or refuse to use the dollar, and from the EU if Brussels fails to increase its purchases of US energy resources. Denmark may also be affected if it refuses to return Greenland to the US.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 01:51 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https://finance.rambler.ru/economics/54086126-amerikanskie-poshliny-pereorientiruyut-tovaropotok-v-rossiyu/)\n\n**Trump Threatens Tariffs on Countries that Refuse to Cooperate**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose tariffs on countries that refuse to cooperate or invest in the US, or fail to balance trade. The first target is China, where Trump said that if China does not agree to a deal to sell the popular social media app TikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, the US will impose tariffs on China. Trump stated, 'We're interested in TikTok if the US is a partner in it,' and added that 'the US will have half the value of TikTok if we reach an agreement on it.' Trump has signed an executive order delaying the ban on TikTok for 75 days, as promised. The order directs the US Department of Justice not to enforce the law on foreign-controlled apps, which was passed with broad bipartisan support in Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden in April last year. The law requires TikTok to be banned in the US starting from January 19 unless it is sold to an American buyer or one of its allies. Trump has also announced a study to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada by February 2025. This change in trade policy in North America will raise prices for American consumers, and Trump has stated that these tariffs will be part of his strategy to pressure allies to provide more financial commitments. As a candidate, Trump proposed imposing comprehensive tariffs: up to 20% on imports from all countries, with a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, and a 60% punitive tariff on goods from China. Trump has also demanded that NATO increase its defense spending to 5% of each member country's GDP. He has also promised to use tariffs as a bargaining chip with other countries, including Denmark, to pressure the European country to hand over control of Greenland to the US.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 02:57 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0629](https://al-ain.com/article/trump-brandishes-tariffs-world)\n\n**Trump's Tariff Threat: How it Could Affect Ozempic and Lego Prices**\nUS President Donald Trump threatened to impose high import tariffs on Danish products entering the US, including popular items like Ozempic and Lego, if Denmark does not agree to cede the territory to the US. Denmark is a small trading partner of the US, exporting over $11 billion in goods to the US in 2023, which is a small fraction of the over $3 trillion in imports entering the US. However, Denmark is more dependent on its trade relationship with the US, despite exporting more than twice what it imports. If Trump follows through with his plan, it could lead to higher prices for Americans on popular items like Ozempic, a weight loss medication, and Lego, which are both made in Denmark.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 08:42 AM\nSource:[UOL  not\u00edcias](https://noticias.uol.com.br/internacional/ultimas-noticias/2025/01/14/obsessao-de-trump-com-a-groenlandia-pode-encarecer-ozempic-e-lego-nos-eua.htm)\n\n**Trump's plan to impose tariffs in bid to acquire Greenland could...**\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Denmark if it does not allow Greenland to join the United States, citing national security concerns. This could lead to higher prices for popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, as well as Lego toys, according to a report. Denmark is a small trading partner, sending $11 billion in goods to the US in 2023, but the goods it sends, including Legos, medicines, and hearing aids, are desirable and could get more expensive if Trump follows through on his tariff promise. Novo Nordisk, the firm behind Ozempic and Wegovy, has been ramping up its US production, but hefty tariffs could spike prices. Denmark's prime minister, M\u00fate Egede, responded to Trump's proposal, saying 'Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 11:04 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2025/01/09/business/trumps-greenland-tariff-plan-could-raise-prices-for-ozempic-legos/)\n\n**Denmark Faces Threat of US Tariff Increase**\nThe threat of a potential increase in US tariffs on Danish products has caused concern in Denmark. After US President-elect Donald Trump's comments on January 7, the shares of two major Danish wind turbine companies, Vestas and Orsted, plummeted. Trump had accused wind turbines of causing a record number of whale deaths and threatened to impose 'very high tariffs on Danish products' if Denmark refused to cede the autonomous territory of Greenland. Jens Legefoged Mortensen, a professor at the University of Copenhagen, notes that the threat of a trade war seems more realistic. Denmark's exports to the US have surged to 326 billion kroner (43.7 billion euros) in the first 11 months of 2024, a 20% increase from 2023. However, the Danish Chamber of Commerce believes that the impact of a potential tariff increase would be limited, as 80% of Danish goods and services imported by the US are produced outside of Denmark. The EU is also expected to defend its interests in the event of a trade war, citing the 'serment des Mousquetaires' pact, which binds EU members to defend each other in the face of commercial restrictions.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 03:50 PM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2025/01/09/le-danemark-face-a-la-menace-d-une-hausse-des-tarifs-douaniers-americains_6489948_3234.html)\n\n**Trump's Tariff Threat: A Potential Blow to Denmark's Pharmaceutical Industry**\nUS presidential candidate Donald Trump has threatened to impose 'extremely high tariffs' on Denmark if it does not agree to make Greenland a part of the US. This statement has sparked a strong response from the Danish government and has raised concerns among Danish businesses about the potential economic impact. According to The New York Times, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen responded strongly to Trump's statement, saying that Greenland may become independent but will not become a US state. Greenland's Prime Minister Mute Egede also reiterated in his New Year's speech that Greenland will not be sold and has increased its independence claims. Greenland's Finance Minister Jensen further emphasized that Greenland's goal is to ultimately achieve independence. The Danish pharmaceutical industry may be the biggest victim of this threat. Novo Nordisk, a pharmaceutical giant, has created over 7,500 direct jobs and 8,400 indirect jobs in Denmark from January 2023 to March 2024. The company has recently accounted for half of Denmark's private sector employment growth, earning Denmark the reputation as the 'pharmaceutical nation.' The Economic Council has therefore increased its GDP growth forecast for 2024 to 2.6%. In addition to pharmaceutical products, Denmark's main exports to the US include medical instruments, fish fillets, pork, and the well-known toy brand LEGO. The US, on the other hand, exports industrial machinery, computers, aircraft, and scientific instruments to Denmark. Danish businesses have expressed high concern about this threat. Danske Bank analysis suggests that the tariff measures could 'cause significant harm to Danish businesses.' Danish Prime Minister Frederiksen has stated that engaging in a trade war with the US is not a wise decision.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 06:11 AM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831\u96fb\u5b50\u5831](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/4918278)\n\n**Trump's Tariff Threat to Denmark: A Warning to Small Countries**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if it doesn't sell Greenland to the US. According to a report by Bloomberg Economics, this move shows that a major power like the US can use tariffs to pressure smaller countries like Denmark. Denmark's trade with the US is much more important to Denmark than the US's trade with Denmark is to the US. In 2023, the US accounted for only about 5% of Denmark's total exports, making it one of the country's top export destinations after Germany and Sweden. In contrast, Denmark accounted for only 0.4% of the US's total imports in 2023. Furthermore, the US's dependence on Danish products is limited, with only about 1% of the US's total aircraft imports coming from Denmark. If Trump's government is serious about acquiring Greenland, industries such as pharmaceuticals could become the target of tariffs, causing significant harm to Denmark while the US pays a minimal price.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 02:16 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8fztk1kzGpw)\n\n**Donald Trump Threatens to Impose High Tariffs on Denmark if They Reject His Proposal to Buy Greenland in 2025**\nDonald Trump has threatened to impose high tariffs on Denmark if the country rejects his proposal to buy Greenland in 2025. Trump made his position clear during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, warning that he would impose 'high-level' tariffs on Denmark if the Danish government continues to resist the offer. Trump's proposal has sparked concerns about the impact on Denmark's economy, particularly in the production and export of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are manufactured by Novo Nordisk. Dr. Grant Harting, a licensed pharmacist, explained that a tariff on these products could drive up prices in the U.S., potentially affecting millions of Americans who rely on them for diabetes management or weight loss. Trump's tariff threats don't stop with Denmark, as he has also proposed imposing a 25% tariff on Canada and Mexico in response to the ongoing immigration and border crisis, and an additional 10% tariff on China. Trump's proposals continue to shape political and economic discussions worldwide, including his interest in making Canada the 51st state and acquiring Panama. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 08:44 PM\nSource:[tdpelmedia.com](https://tdpelmedia.com/donald-trump-threatens-to-impose-high-tariffs-on-denmark-if-they-reject-his-proposal-to-buy-greenland-in-2025/)\n\n",
