Al-Shibani led a delegation in his first visit to the European Union since the ousting of Bashar al-Assad, following French President Emmanuel Macron's invitation to Syrian President Ahmad al-Shar'a, who is under UN sanctions. A French official said, 'The Paris meeting aims to provide some kind of protection around the Syrian crisis to allow for a solution through deterring the losers from destabilizing the state.' Representatives from regional countries such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Lebanon, as well as Western powers, will participate in the conference, but the US will be represented by a lower-level diplomat. The French Foreign Ministry stated that the meeting aims to coordinate efforts to achieve a peaceful transition that ensures Syria's sovereignty and security, and mobilize the efforts of Syria's neighbors and main partners to coordinate aid and economic support. The conference will also discuss transitional justice and combating impunity. The conference does not aim to collect funds, as this task will be handled by the annual donor conference in Brussels in March, but it will discuss issues such as lifting sanctions. Diplomats said that the EU is moving towards lifting some sanctions, despite obstacles from Cyprus and Greece due to concerns over maritime border demarcation talks between Syria and Turkey and demands for guarantees on the possibility of quickly reimposing sanctions. They added that they hope to reach a settlement this month. Before the meeting, major international donors also discussed the humanitarian situation, particularly in northeast Syria, where the reduction of US aid had a 'catastrophic' impact, according to an EU official. The talks will also include the issue of the Western-backed Syrian Kurdish forces and the central government, as well as Turkey, which classifies some of those forces as terrorist groups. A Turkish diplomat said that Deputy Foreign Minister Nuh Yilmaz, who will participate in the meeting, 'will draw attention to the threats facing Syria, particularly the terrorist organization, and will emphasize Turkey's determination to completely cleanse the country of terrorist elements.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[SWI swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/ara/%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%B2%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A/88868113)\n\n**EU Moves to Lift Sanctions on Syria, Conditioned on Disarmament of Kurdish Forces**\nThe French Foreign Minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, stated that the European Union is working to lift economic sanctions on Syria quickly. This comes as Paris hosts a conference on the transitional process in the country after the fall of the Assad regime. The conference aims to establish a national dialogue to determine the future of Syria. However, the Syrian government's new administration has set a condition for the dialogue: the disarmament of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF has been a key player in the fight against ISIS in Syria, but the Syrian government views them as a threat. The conference will also discuss the issue of transitional justice and ensuring accountability for human rights abuses. The EU has announced plans to adjust its sanctions on Syria, but will maintain a freeze on the assets and travel ban on former regime officials. The conference will be attended by foreign ministers from the region, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Lebanon, as well as Western powers. However, the US will be represented at a lower level. The EU is also considering lifting some sanctions, but this is facing opposition from Cyprus and Greece due to concerns over the demarcation of maritime borders between Syria and Turkey. A diplomat said that the EU is moving towards lifting some sanctions, but this is facing hurdles due to opposition from some member states. He added that the EU hopes to reach a compromise this month. The conference will also discuss the humanitarian situation in Syria, particularly in the north-east, where a significant reduction in aid from the US has had a 'catastrophic' impact, according to a European official. The conference will also address the issue of the SDF and the Syrian government, as well as Turkey's concerns about the presence of Kurdish forces in Syria. A Turkish diplomat said that the conference will focus on the threats facing Syria, particularly the 'terrorist' organization, and will emphasize Turkey's commitment to clearing the country of all terrorist elements. 'We will highlight the threats facing Syria, particularly the terrorist organization, and will emphasize our commitment to clearing the country of all terrorist elements,' he said.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 09:00 AM\nSource:[independentarabia.com](https://www.independentarabia.com/node/617692/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/%D8%A7%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A8%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AE%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%B7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A)\n\n**Syrian Foreign Minister Attends Paris Conference, UN Official Warns Against 'Cycles of Revenge'**\nSyrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan Al-Sheibani attended a conference in Paris to discuss the situation in Syria, while a UN official warned against 'cycles of revenge' after the ousting of President Bashar Al-Assad. The conference aims to coordinate efforts to achieve a peaceful transition that ensures the sovereignty and security of Syria, and to mobilize the efforts of Syria's neighbors and main partners to coordinate aid and economic support. The conference will also discuss transitional justice and the prevention of impunity. A diplomat said that the EU is considering lifting some sanctions, but this is facing obstacles from Cyprus and Greece, amid concerns about negotiations on the demarcation of the maritime border between Syria and Turkey and demands for guarantees on the possibility of re-imposing sanctions quickly. A UN official, Geir Pedersen, urged the new authorities to avoid 'cycles of revenge' in Syria, and spoke at a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday about reports of 'killing, serious mistreatment during detention, and forced displacement of families from public housing'. Pedersen condemned the 'kidnappings, looting, and seizure of property, and forced displacement of families from public housing'. He said that he received assurances from the current authorities that there is no policy of revenge, and that hundreds of detainees have been released from prisons. Pedersen stressed that all armed parties must stop this type of action, and that they must take concrete measures to confirm their commitment to transitional justice. He also mentioned that there are concerns among the population about 'discriminatory practices against women' and the increasing 'social pressure towards certain standards'. Pedersen welcomed 'important decisions and signals from the EU and the US in recent weeks', and said that he conveyed to the transitional authorities his assessment that 'a reliable transition will be necessary to continue and expand the positive and bold moves in the field of sanctions'. He said that 'it is essential to avoid further conflict that could have severe effects on Syrian civilians, stability, economy, transition, and the fight against ISIS, and perhaps international peace and security'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 08:33 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/2/13/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b4%d9%8a%d8%a8%d8%a7%d9%86%d9%8a-%d9%8a%d8%ad%d8%b6%d8%b1-%d8%a7%d8%ac%d8%aa%d9%85%d8%a7%d8%b9-%d8%a8%d8%a7%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%b3-%d9%88%d8%aa%d8%ad%d8%b0%d9%8a%d8%b1)\n\n**Syrian Foreign Minister to Attend International Conference in Paris**\nSyrian Foreign Minister Asaad Hassan al-Shibani is set to attend an international conference in Paris on Thursday, as regional and Western powers seek to protect the country during a fragile transitional period.

According to the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), Director of Relations at the General Authority, Mazen Aloush, stated that Turkey has lifted restrictions on Syrian imports to the Turkish market. Aloush said, 'The efforts of the General Authority and the Turkish Ministry of Trade have resulted in the decision to lift restrictions on the export of Syrian goods to the Turkish market, in addition to opening its territories to re-activate the transit of goods to foreign countries.' Aloush thanked the Turkish Minister of Trade for the decision, saying it 'reflects the depth of trade relations between the two countries.' He added that this decision will contribute to 'strengthening economic cooperation and mutual trade, with the hope of continuing the fruitful work between institutions to achieve further progress and prosperity.' Turkish Trade Minister \u00d6mer Bolat announced on Tuesday that his country would begin talks with Syrian officials to re-activate the free trade agreement between the two countries, which was signed in 2007 but suspended due to the civil war in 2011. In a related context, Aloush announced on Monday that over 100,000 Syrians have returned from Turkey after the fall of the Assad regime. He said, 'During the past two months of liberating Syria from the previous regime, the border crossings with Turkey have received 100,905 Syrian citizens returning to settle in their homeland.' On Tuesday, the Turkish Ministry of Trade announced the lifting of restrictions imposed on Syria during the previous regime, treating Syria as any other country in terms of trade. This includes the cancellation of regulations related to exports and transit operations through Turkish customs to Syria. According to these amendments, Syrian goods exported to Turkey or transiting through it will be subject to the same conditions as those applied to other countries. Additionally, permission will be granted for the passage of goods from Syria to other countries through Turkey, excluding scrap metal.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 01:31 PM\nSource:[pressbee.net](https://ar.pressbee.net/show9235255.html?title=%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%B4%D9%83%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%82%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA-%D9%85%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B6%D8%A9-%D8%B2%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%B8%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84)\n\n**Turkey Lifts Restrictions on Syrian Imports, Boosts Trade Relations**\nThe General Authority for Seaports and Borders Director of Relations, Mazen Al-Olush, said on Tuesday that Turkey has lifted the restrictions on Syrian imports to the Turkish market.

The statement reads, 'In the new period that began on December 8, 2024, progress in economic and trade relations between Turkey and Syria continues. The road map created by our government in accordance with the agreement reached with Syria regarding the new period is being implemented step by step.' It is noted that the supply of goods for export and import is subject to the same conditions as for other countries. The statement also mentions that the existing lists of restrictions on export to Syria and transit through Turkey's customs territory have been canceled, and transit of other goods from Syria to third countries through Turkey is now free, except for 'scrap metal.' Normalized procedures for importing goods from Syria have also been established. The statement clarifies that the same conditions as for third countries will be applied to goods imported from Syria, regarding import rules, product safety control, and customs duties. This move is in line with Turkey's previous statements, including President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's announcement that Turkey is ready to provide necessary support in the fight against all forms of terrorism and in the reconstruction of destroyed cities and critical infrastructure in Syria. Turkey is also advocating for the complete lifting of EU sanctions on Syria.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 09:42 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041a\u0420\u0406\u041d\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-economy/3959129-tureccina-skasuvala-obmezenna-na-eksport-ta-import-iz-sirieu.html)\n\n**Turkey and Syria Trade Restrictions Lifted**\nThe Turkish Ministry of Trade announced that restrictions on trade between Turkey and Syria have been lifted, effective February 8, 2025.

Erdogan emphasized that Israel must end its occupation of Palestinian territories and compensate for the damage it has caused. He also stressed the need for an independent Palestinian state with sovereignty and geographical integration on the 1967 borders and East Jerusalem as its capital. Erdogan called on member states of the 'Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) to cooperate to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza. He confirmed that Turkey is closely monitoring Malaysia's stance on Gaza and Palestine. Erdogan also mentioned that Turkey has sent over 100 ships to Palestine so far, and these efforts are ongoing. Despite the ceasefire, the Israeli army regularly fires at Palestinians in various areas of the Gaza Strip, resulting in casualties, including children and elderly. The Gaza government's media office confirmed that despite the 20-day ceasefire, the humanitarian situation in Gaza remains catastrophic due to Israel's delay in implementing the agreement. The US-backed Israeli forces committed a genocide in Gaza between October 7, 2023, and January 19, 2025, resulting in around 160,000 Palestinian casualties, mostly children and women, and over 14,000 missing persons. Erdogan also touched on the Syrian file, stating, 'There is no longer anything called infrastructure or superstructure in Syria, everything has been destroyed, and we will work together to determine what we can do regarding the superstructure and basic infrastructure through the steps we will take with Malaysia.' In terms of bilateral relations between Turkey and Malaysia, Erdogan mentioned that the two countries have decided to increase their trade volume to $10 billion. He added that the two countries, which have a comprehensive strategic partnership, derive their strength from their shared ancient history and follow the footsteps of their ancestors. Erdogan stated that they will continue to strengthen their relations in line with the spirit of the comprehensive strategic partnership through the establishment of a high-level strategic cooperation council. He added, 'During our talks today, we have taken steps to enhance our relations, and we have signed 11 agreements in various fields, and there is an agreement between the two sides to increase diversity in trade and investment through a mutually beneficial approach.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[turkeyalaan.net](https://www.turkeyalaan.net/2025/02/11/%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%BA%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B2%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%81%D9%8A/)\n\n**Turkey and Syria Sign Maritime Border Agreement**\nTurkey has announced plans to sign a new agreement with Syria to demarcate their maritime borders in the Mediterranean. This move is seen as a bid to strengthen Turkey's position in the region and challenge the existing energy agreements between Greece, Cyprus, and Israel. The agreement would also allow Turkey to tap into Syria's energy resources and potentially disrupt the EastMed pipeline project. The development has been welcomed by some as a way to increase regional cooperation and energy security, while others have expressed concerns about the potential impact on the region's delicate balance of power. Turkey's move is seen as a response to the EastMed project, which aims to transport gas from Israel and Cyprus to Europe through a pipeline that would pass through Greek and Cypriot waters. Turkey has long opposed the project, and has instead sought to develop its own energy resources in the region. The agreement with Syria would give Turkey a significant advantage in the region, and could potentially allow it to become a major energy player in the Mediterranean. However, the move has also been criticized by some as a bid to expand Turkey's influence in the region at the expense of other countries. The situation is complex, and it remains to be seen how it will play out. \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[indyturk.com](https://www.indyturk.com/node/752553/d%C3%BCnyadan-sesler/suriye-erdo%C4%9Fana-akdenizdeki-do%C4%9Falgaz-ittifaklar%C4%B1n%C4%B1-yeniden)\n\n**Turkey and Syria Move to Demarcate Maritime Borders in the Mediterranean**\nTurkey has announced its intention to demarcate its maritime borders with Syria in the Mediterranean, which has sparked strong reactions from Greece and Cyprus, who consider the potential agreement to be illegal. Egypt has not yet taken a stance, amidst its rapprochement with Turkey. The conflict over energy resources in the Mediterranean is escalating due to estimates of vast amounts of gas and oil, prompting countries bordering the sea to intensify their efforts to explore these resources. The balance of power in the Mediterranean is shifting, with Syria entering the equation, following Turkey's announcement of its intention to demarcate its maritime borders with Syria in the Mediterranean, which would allow the two countries to determine their areas of influence for oil and gas exploration. The Mediterranean has been a stage for border disputes in recent years, with Arab and European countries, including Egypt and Greece, facing off against Turkey. However, Turkey surprised everyone by signing an agreement with Libya in 2019 to demarcate their maritime borders, which sparked outrage in Athens and European capitals, including Cairo. Turkey's announcement has caught everyone off guard this time from the east, with its intention to sign an agreement with Damascus. Turkish Transport and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uralo\u011flu announced that his country aims to demarcate its maritime borders with Syria in the Mediterranean after the formation of a permanent government in Damascus, stating that 'this agreement will allow the two countries to determine their areas of influence for oil and gas exploration.' Any future agreement in this field 'will be in line with international law.' The only official response to the Turkish announcement was from the Syrian Transport Minister, Bahaa al-Din Sharim, who said that 'demarcating borders is not within the competence of the current government.' The Egyptian position remains unclear, amidst its rapprochement with Turkey, while analysts say it will be more complex, especially in light of the gas crisis Egypt is experiencing. The Syrian government has not yet taken a stance on the Turkish proposal, but sources from the Syrian Transport Ministry told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the minister had confirmed that 'all investment contracts in Syrian ports will be reviewed by a committee of legal experts.' Economic experts and lawyers from Syria and Turkey agree that it is the right of both countries to demarcate their maritime borders, as long as it is done in accordance with international law and ensures the rights of both countries. However, the Turkish initiative has been met with skepticism by some, who argue that it is not the right time for such an agreement, especially given the existing investment contracts between Syria and other countries, including Iran and Russia. The dispute over maritime borders in the Mediterranean has been ongoing for years, with some countries, including Greece and Cyprus, calling for the application of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, while Turkey claims to be acting in accordance with international law. The convention, which was adopted in 1982, states that each country has a 'exclusive economic zone' of 200 nautical miles. However, in the case of the eastern Mediterranean, countries with shared maritime borders are those with shorter distances between them. Syria is not a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and has refused to demarcate its borders with Lebanon. After the Syrian war in 2011, Damascus was largely excluded from the equation, only to return to the scene after Turkey's invitation to negotiate. Turkish economic analyst Yusuf Kocabasoglu told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that 'Turkey has the natural right to have agreements with countries bordering the Mediterranean, and Turkey has the longest coastline in the eastern Mediterranean, with a length of around 1,100 kilometers. After the discovery of vast amounts of gas and oil under the Mediterranean, all countries bordering the eastern Mediterranean have strategic plans to explore and invest in these resources, and therefore, issues of demarcating maritime borders between these countries are a top priority.' He added that 'there are attempts by some countries, including Greece, Cyprus, France, and Israel, to undermine Turkey's role or create problems during demarcation with Libya or while maintaining the rights of Cyprus.' He emphasized the importance of what Turkey is doing to accelerate what needs to be done from bilateral agreements with Syria, as both countries border the Mediterranean, and 'no country has the right to object to countries that are adjacent and neighboring, as it is a natural and sovereign right.' Turkey was excluded from two conferences held on the gas of the Mediterranean in Athens in 2017 and in Cairo in 2019, and 'what Turkey is doing in what is called the Blue Homeland is its right that it will not give up, and it will follow the path with Syria as it did with Libya in 2019 and will not pay attention to objections as long as it is acting in accordance with the law and in the context of common interests.' The Syrian Bar Association's President, Ghazwan Qar'afel, said that 'the upcoming negotiations between Syria and Turkey must start from the rights and good relations of the initial demarcation that must be later followed by international laws and principles of the United Nations, and an attempt to distance ourselves from what we see as conflicts and polarization between countries in the eastern Mediterranean, because the current conflict between countries in the eastern Mediterranean has historical, economic, and geographical reasons, but the political factor dominates the conflict, which takes the form of escalation and complexity before the confrontation by a little.' The conflict between countries bordering the Mediterranean has escalated, especially after Israel's ambitions and its conflict with the Palestinians, Lebanon, and the dispute over Cyprus's Greek and Turkish borders, and Turkey's exclusion from the gas of the Mediterranean forum. The conflict began after the US Geological Survey estimated in 2010 that there are approximately 122 trillion cubic meters of undiscovered gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, off the coasts of Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Cyprus, in addition to approximately 107 billion barrels of extractable oil. Despite the fact that these numbers are still within the realm of estimates, what has been added to them is the discovery of several gas fields in the region of the eastern Mediterranean. The exploration activities have increased after the success of the alliance led by the American company 'Nobel Energy' in discovering the 'Tamar' field in 2009 off the coast of Palestine, and with the succession of discoveries, the countries of the region have become more interested in commissioning foreign companies to conduct exploration activities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 03:52 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f](https://www.alaraby.co.uk/economy/%D8%B5%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%A3%D8%AC%D8%AC-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B7-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF)\n\n**Turkey's Maritime Border Demarcation with Syria: A Strategic Necessity or a Premature Move?**\nTurkey is seeking to demarcate its maritime borders with Syria in the Mediterranean, a move that has sparked questions about its timing and legitimacy. According to a report by 'The Independent Arabic', Turkey will invest in its relations with the new Syrian leadership to sign economic, political, and security agreements that will secure its interests in the southern neighbor and the region as a whole. However, the current Syrian government lacks the international recognition to enter into agreements with external parties, especially in strategic files. Turkish Minister of Transport and Infrastructure Abdulkadir Uraloglu said that his country aims to demarcate its maritime borders with Syria after a stable government is formed in Damascus, noting that 'this deal will allow both countries to determine their areas of influence for oil and gas exploration'. Any future agreement in this field 'will be in line with international law'. The rapid approach that comes to mind for Syrians and the region is the agreement signed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Libyan Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj in 2019, which also aimed to demarcate the maritime borders between the two countries and sparked internal Libyan disputes and problems between Turkey and other countries bordering the Mediterranean. According to 'The Independent Arabic', the Libyan government at the time did not represent the country as a whole, and several countries in the region criticized the agreement, saying that the signatories did not have the necessary popular and legal mandate. Ankara exploited its relationship with the Tripoli government to pass an understanding that gives the Turks significant influence in international and regional waters in the Mediterranean at the expense of other parties. Despite internal and external objections, the Turkish parliament approved the memorandum of understanding with Libya on December 5, 2019, and the Libyan Presidential Council approved it on the same day. In 2020, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres approved the agreement under Article 102 of the UN Charter. Through this approach, the current Syrian government needs international recognition to enter into agreements with external parties, which Turkey is aware of, according to Uraloglu's statements. The legitimacy that the new Syrian leadership is seeking is still being discussed within the corridors of international politics, as there is a list of requirements for the transitional phase that the Syrian government must fulfill to convince the world of its good intentions towards the Syrians and regional security. Starting with the national dialogue and ending with holding fair elections in the country based on a new constitution agreed upon by the Syrians, all these steps must be taken theoretically to obtain a legitimate authority in Damascus that can enter into alliances and agreements with external parties. Overcoming all this may require a series of understandings between the countries involved in the Syrian file, as the Syrian geography is divided among several countries, and the common ground for the Syrians' vision of their country's future is not large, and it is also affected by past and present trends. The question is why Turkey hastened to announce its plans in the Mediterranean before the situation in Syria is stabilized and the Syrians have a legitimate government recognized internationally? According to Dr. Samir Salha, a professor of international relations at Istanbul University, the agreements related to this region, particularly in the Syrian file, have always been unclear and do not take into account Turkey's interests, and there is a great opportunity for Ankara to seize them and clarify them, even in a preliminary form. Salha points out that the current government in Damascus does not have sufficient legitimacy to enter into final agreements with external parties, but Turkey can sign a preliminary memorandum with the new Syrian leaders, which will serve as a general framework for any future negotiations or agreements on demarcating the maritime borders between the two countries. According to Dr. Ahmed Ajaj, a researcher and academic in international law, the temporary government in Damascus, as a 'government of fact', can enter into external agreements as long as it has ambassadors and represents the Syrian state in international forums, but this does not negate the right of the future Syrian parliament to review and approve or reject these agreements according to the public interest. Ajaj emphasizes that 'the temporary Syrian government, as long as it is able to control security and manage the country's affairs according to known standards, can enter into economic, political, and security agreements with external parties, but the judgment on the content of these agreements in terms of their justice and fulfillment of national aspirations remains dependent on the elected Syrian parliament'. Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa recently stated that his government will review the agreements signed by the previous regime with Russia over the past few years to assess their fairness to the Syrians. Everyone knows that the ousted President Bashar al-Assad signed the agreements with Moscow from a position of weakness, as he needed Russian protection and military support against the opposition. The question now is whether al-Sharaa's government will sign agreements with Turkey based on its own needs or the interests of the state? \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 06:57 PM\nSource:[pressbee.net](https://ar.pressbee.net/show9082552.html?title=%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A8%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%85-%D8%B6%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%8A)\n\n**Turkey's Proposal to Demarcate Maritime Border with Syria Raises Concerns**\nTurkey has announced plans to begin negotiations with Syria to demarcate their maritime borders in the Mediterranean. However, this proposal has raised concerns, as Turkey previously refused to sign the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which is the primary legal framework for demarcating maritime borders. According to analyst Sarkis Qasargian, 'the Turkish proposal on demarcating the maritime border with Syria puts us in the same situation as Libya, with some differences in the details of power-sharing.' He notes that 'the similarity between the two cases can be seen in the presence of a government allied with Ankara, as is the case in Libya, but in Syria, this government lacks the international and domestic legitimacy required to conclude international agreements.' The situation in Syria is similar to that in Libya, where Turkey attempted to demarcate the maritime border and impose its authority, while also seeking to exploit resources in Syria for the benefit of Turkey. However, Turkey also aims to maintain the minimum level of legitimacy for the Syrian government to continue to govern, as it has presented itself as a guarantor and responsible party for the Syrian Salvation Government. Any setback or failure of the Syrian Salvation Government will also reflect on Turkey and make it responsible for this failure, and therefore, Turkey is trying to benefit economically and at the same time to obtain a minimum level of international support for the government to manage the affairs of the country, especially in the face of the economic collapse that Syria is experiencing. According to analyst Musa Ozogurlo, 'Syria represents a strategic target for Turkey, especially for the ruling Justice and Development Party.' He notes that 'the current government in Turkey sees the current situation in Syria as a historical opportunity to consolidate its presence.' Turkey has economic goals in the Mediterranean and also adheres to international law within Syria, and therefore, it has been dealing with armed factions in Syria for years, up to the current government in Damascus, which is seeking to conclude an agreement with it. Turkey is trying to conclude rapid agreements with Syria before the existence of a parliament and government that may object to such agreements, and therefore, the maritime agreement between Syria and Turkey may be similar to the Libyan one. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 25, 2024 04:55 PM\nSource:[alarabiya.net](https://www.alarabiya.net/arab-and-world/syria/2024/12/25/-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B5%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%AE%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**Greece Rejects Turkey's Plans to Sign Maritime Border Agreement with Syria**\nGreece has rejected Turkey's plans to sign an agreement to demarcate maritime borders with Syria, considering any agreement 'legally invalid' because the new Syrian government is a transitional authority unable to sign valid agreements. Greek diplomatic sources said that 'the situation in Syria is transitional, and does not justify such agreements', adding that Athens is closely following developments and maintaining constant contact with Cyprus, neighboring countries, and the European Union. A Greek official stated that 'our priority is to prevent Turkey from creating a legal cover', adding that Athens is also working to strengthen its alliances with Cyprus and Israel to counter Turkey's regional maneuvers. This comes after Turkish Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Abdulkadir Uralo\u011flu announced Turkey's intention to start negotiations with Syria to demarcate maritime borders in the Mediterranean region, saying that the agreement would 'increase the influence of both countries in exploring energy resources, and change all the balances in the region'. Uralo\u011flu explained that a maritime border agreement between Turkey and Syria would allow the two countries to 'share and expand their authorities, regarding the exploration of oil and hydrocarbons in the eastern Mediterranean, in accordance with international law', adding that 'this agreement, if signed, would change all the balances in the eastern Mediterranean region'. However, the minister noted that 'it is not possible to say that demarcating maritime borders with Syria is on Ankara's agenda at the moment, because there are primary issues that need to be resolved first, such as paying the salaries of employees and disarming armed groups'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 25, 2024 03:46 PM\nSource:[syria.tv](https://www.syria.tv/%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A9-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B6-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B7-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**Greece Rejects Proposed Maritime Agreement Between Turkey and Syria**\nGreece has rejected a proposed maritime agreement between Turkey and Syria, describing the Syrian government as a 'transitional authority' unable to sign legally binding agreements.

Greek diplomatic sources said, 'The situation in Syria is transitional, and it does not give legitimacy to such agreements,' adding, 'We are closely monitoring the developments and are in constant contact with Cyprus, neighboring countries, and the European Union.' Greek officials have warned that the agreement could undermine their country's sovereign rights and set a precedent that challenges the maritime rights of islands like Crete and Cyprus.

Turkey supported the Syrian opposition that overthrew President Bashar al-Assad this month, ending a 13-year civil war. Turkey is in close contact with the new interim government in Syria, including a meeting between the head of Turkish intelligence and the Foreign Minister with the actual leader of Syria, Ahmad al-Shara. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week that Ankara would improve relations with Syria in areas including trade, energy, and defense. Oural Oglu told reporters that Turkey also plans to start negotiations with the new Syrian government on a possible agreement to demarcate the maritime border. He added, 'Of course, establishing authority there first is necessary... It will certainly be on our agenda, but it's hard to say it's on the current agenda.'

'We are likely to sign an agreement on maritime borders in the future and our interests in the Eastern Mediterranean will be protected.
