The report cites concerns over an increasing number of nuclear weapons, ongoing world conflicts, and the 'chances of democratic depression' worldwide. As Axios reports, only a small minority of the over 350 international experts surveyed think that democracy will improve in the next decade. The experts' outlook is bleak, with many anticipating a decline in global stability and security.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 08:40 PM\nSource:[Newser](https://www.newser.com/story/364235/experts-predictions-for-earth-in-2035-arent-great.html)\n\n**Ecumenical Initiative Calls for Unity to Celebrate Easter Together**\nThe Ecumenical Initiative 'Pasqua Together 2025' is calling for unity among Christians to celebrate Easter together, saying 'it is unacceptable that the division continues.' The initiative, led by Kostas Mygdalis, aims to promote a common date for Easter between Orthodox and Catholic Christians. This year, both Easter dates coincide on April 20 due to the concordance of the Julian and Gregorian calendars. Mygdalis emphasizes that the celebration of Easter in 2025 should not be seen as just a calendar agreement, but as an opportunity to put Christ at the center of Christian faith. He also highlights the need for unity in the world, saying 'the world needs unity. A common date for Easter is a step towards this unity.' However, he warns that the administrative structures of the churches are resistant to addressing this issue, fearing the creation of new extremism and divisions. Mygdalis also notes that the dialogue between Christian churches is advancing slowly, and that the effort to celebrate Easter together should be part of a 'pilgrimage of reconciliation and unity' that will continue beyond 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 02:29 PM\nSource:[aciprensa.com](https://www.aciprensa.com/noticias/110819/iniciativa-ecumenica-pide-unidad-para-celebrar-juntos-la-pascua)\n\n**Major warning issued as huge change coming to weekly social welfare payment amid new rules**\nA major change is coming to the weekly Fuel Allowance payment in April 2025.

However, experts remain calm, as the chance of a flyby is still 97.7%. David Rankin from the Catalina Sky Survey explained, 'We are still at 97.7% chance of a flyby.' He emphasized that such adjustments to calculations are normal, especially for newly discovered asteroids. 'The more data we collect, the more accurate our predictions become.' The asteroid, which is approximately 40-90 meters in size, can still be observed from terrestrial telescopes until April and will be studied by the James-Webb-Weltraumteleskop in March. Additional data will provide a clearer picture, and the impact probability is likely to decrease or the asteroid may be removed from the risk list altogether.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[gmx.at](https://www.gmx.at/magazine/wissen/weltraum/asteroid-2024-yra-wahrscheinlichkeit-einschlag-erde-erhoeht-40657904)\n\n**World Bank Internship 2025: Apply Now for a Chance to Work with the Organization**\nThe World Bank has announced an internship program for 2025, offering a chance to work with the organization and gain valuable experience.

The year 2025 is crucial for the planet, and according to experts, what happens in the coming months will have a decisive impact on the future of our species and the world we live in. This is the year in which, as stipulated in the Paris Agreement, countries must present new plans to reduce emissions that will allow them to limit global temperature increases and contain climate chaos. The goal is to design 'more ambitious' and 'more viable' measures to curb the climate crisis. According to an analysis by the International Energy Agency, if current trends continue, the world will be exposed to an increase of 2-3 degrees Celsius in average temperature by the end of the century. In places like Spain, this would translate to an increase of over 4 degrees Celsius in average temperature, as well as more droughts, more torrential rains, and more extreme weather events. Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Service, says that the current situation is 'a warning signal' but not a definitive defeat in the fight against climate change. The study highlights 2025 as a key year for global climate action. According to the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this is the year in which greenhouse gas emissions must peak and then decline sharply to reach half by 2030 and net zero by 2050. However, current trends show that global emissions, especially those from fossil fuel combustion, continue to grow year after year. Experts emphasize that the effort must be common but not equal for all. 'Countries that have historically emitted more must make more efforts to reduce emissions,' says Olga Alcaraz Sendra, director of the group of researchers on climate change governance at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. According to her analysis, based on equity criteria, countries like the US should be the first to apply drastic cuts and achieve climate neutrality. Europe should reduce its emissions by 90-95% by 2035. Achieving these numbers is not just a matter of mathematics, but international cooperation. 'No country has a concrete goal for reducing emissions, but rather each government sets its own objectives,' says Ana P\u00e9rez Catal\u00e1, researcher at the Institute for Sustainable Development (IDDRI) in Paris. According to her, the current context will be decisive for designing these climate objectives. On the one hand, the convulsive geopolitical situation, wars, and the victory of Donald Trump could minimize the importance of the climate debate. On the other hand, the increase in natural disasters on the planet, from the floods in Valencia to the fires in Los Angeles, could serve to design more ambitious measures. The great challenge of reducing emissions is in the hands of national policies and large-scale measures in economic and industrial sectors. However, experts emphasize that citizens also have a key role in this fight. But how? A survey led by the Ipsos platform showed the 'gap' between the measures people believe help reduce emissions and those that actually have an impact. The 59% of the population believes that recycling is a key measure to reduce emissions, but in reality, this measure has a minimal impact on emissions. In contrast, a measure like reducing car use, which only 17% of the population mentions, is the one that would save the most CO2. Similarly, among individual actions that are most effective in reducing emissions, minimizing flights, and adopting a more vegetarian diet with less meat stand out. The 2025 year starts with the ambitious challenge of accelerating the global climate fight. At least on paper, countries will have to present their updated plans for reducing emissions in the coming months. The EU will present its objective during the first quarter. After that, at the UN assembly in Brazil, it will be discussed whether the sum of all these commitments is enough to avoid extreme global warming. 'What gives me more hope is that we don't need magic recipes or science fiction tools. The solutions already exist and are already here,' concludes P\u00e9rez Catal\u00e1.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 12:12 PM\nSource:[La Provincia](https://www.laprovincia.es/dominical/2025/02/09/cuenta-salvar-mundo-caos-climatico-114109160.html)\n\n**March -- a Month of Destruction: Numerologist Reveals What Awaits Russia in 2025**\nAccording to numerologist Mariana Anael, the world will face significant challenges in 2025.

The report states that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with 41 more days of extreme heat than the previous year. The organization warns that this trend may continue in 2025 and has announced 'urgent' action plans. Here are some striking details from the report: The report highlights that extreme weather conditions reached dangerous levels in 2024, causing record-breaking temperatures, heatwaves that killed thousands of people and displaced millions, droughts, forest fires, and floods. The report emphasizes that these extreme weather conditions show how dangerous life has become due to human-induced 1.3 degree warming. The report states that 26 extreme weather events were analyzed in 2024, resulting in 3,700 reported deaths. However, it is emphasized that the report only includes events that meet certain criteria, and that tens of thousands of people may have died from extreme weather events that are not recorded. The report highlights that heatwaves are the most deadly type of extreme weather event, but that the dangers of high temperatures are not being adequately communicated. The report emphasizes the importance of early warning systems, citing the example of a hospital in Mali where temperatures reached almost 50 degrees Celsius in April, leading to an increase in deaths. The report states that early warning systems are crucial for reducing deaths, and that they should be targeted, provided days in advance, and include clear instructions for what people should do. The report emphasizes that most extreme weather events can be predicted, and that every country should implement, test, and continuously improve early warning systems to ensure that their citizens are safe. The report also emphasizes the need for urgent action on fossil fuels, citing the recent COP28 agreement to phase out fossil fuels. The report states that a rapid transition to renewable energy will help create a safer, healthier, more prosperous, and more stable world. The report emphasizes that developed countries should provide developing countries with tools to invest in adaptation, which will help protect their lives and livelihoods and create a more stable and equitable world.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 06:11 AM\nSource:[haberglobal.com.tr](https://haberglobal.com.tr/yazarlar/artik-vakit-kalmadi-2025-kuresel-afetler-yili-olacak-408724)\n\n**Global Events to Watch in 2025**\nThe world awaits significant events in 2025, including the global year of quantum science and technology, partnerships, and glacier preservation, as declared by the UN.

The world will have to wait until 2026 for the next total solar eclipse. However, the cosmos promises many other amazing moments in 2025. The year will start with a parade of six planets in January that will be visible for weeks. Little Mercury will join the crowd for a parade of seven planets in February. 'People should get out to see them at some point over the next few weeks. I certainly will,' said Bruce Betts, the chief scientist of the Planetary Society. There will be three supermoons in October, November, and December, with the moon appearing particularly large and bright while orbiting closer to Earth than usual. A double cosmic event will repeat in September with a total lunar eclipse lasting over an hour over Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia, and a partial solar eclipse two weeks later near the southernmost point of the world. Six of our seven neighboring planets will align in the sky to form a long arc in mid-January, with all, except Neptune and Uranus, visible to the naked eye just after sunset, if the weather permits. The parade will continue for weeks, with some planets occasionally approaching. Mercury will make a brief appearance at the end of February. The planets will gradually exit, one by one, during the spring. The sun shone brightly last year, painting the sky with beautiful auroras in unexpected places. Space meteorologists predict more geomagnetic storms that could produce even more auroras borealis and australis. This is due to the Sun reaching its maximum solar activity during its current 11-year cycle, which could continue this year. Shawn Dahl, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, encourages everyone to stay informed about space weather, so as not to miss any spectacular shows. The Perseids and Geminids are phenomena that always attract a crowd and reach their peak in August and December, respectively. However, don't rule out smaller and less spectacular meteor showers, such as the Lyrads in April, the Orionids in October, and the Leonids in November. The darker the location and the more opaque the moon, the better the observation will be. Meteor showers are generally named after the constellation in which they appear to originate. They occur when the Earth passes through streams of debris left by comets and, occasionally, asteroids.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 01, 2025 05:57 PM\nSource:[www.diariolibre.com](https://www.diariolibre.com/planeta/ciencia/2025/01/01/momentos-celestiales-asombrosos-para-el-ano-2025/2955611)\n\n**Forecast: A look ahead to what 2025 has in store**\nIn 2025, several significant events are expected to take place.

According to him, the year will be better than 2024, but the first five months will be marked by serious conflicts, especially in March. However, in April and May, things will return to normal. Nahata advises people to take care of themselves, their loved ones, and not to escalate the already tense situation in the world. He believes that if people focus on their health, work well, and help those in need, they will avoid problems. Nahata predicts that 2025 will bring a new world order, with technology dominating the world. He also believes that the world will become more integrated, with many countries becoming one nation by the 2040s. The prophet also made specific predictions about Russia, saying that it will enter a period of stability after April 2025, with a focus on technology, economy, and global development. Nahata emphasized that Russia will remain Russia and will have a bright future for the next 60 years, with improvements in agriculture, foreign relations, trade, economy, and education.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 03:31 PM\nSource:[starhit.ru](https://www.starhit.ru/life/nostradamus-iz-indii-punit-nakhata-pro-2025-i-nas-zhdet-novyi-mirovoi-poryadok-no-snachala-nado-perezhit-mart-6155165/)\n\n",
