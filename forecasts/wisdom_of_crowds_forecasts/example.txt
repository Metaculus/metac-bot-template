Ruto noted that the two nations have a deep-rooted historical connection, dating back to the 1950s when Egypt supported Kenya's struggle for independence. He stated, 'Relations between Kenya and Egypt go back to the 1950s when the North African country supported our fight for independence and freedom.' The two leaders expressed optimism about the future of Kenya-Egypt relations, with Egypt being a close trade partner to Kenya, importing US$600-700 million worth of Kenyan tea annually.

The talks aim to garner international support for regional efforts to address the conflict, which has seen the M23 rebel group capture significant territories, including the strategic city of Goma. The M23 rebellion has led to severe humanitarian consequences, with over a third of North Kivu province's population displaced. France is seeking support for a UN Security Council resolution that would officially name Rwanda as a backer of the M23 rebels. UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has called for Rwandan forces to cease their support for M23 and withdraw from DRC territory. President Ruto's engagement with President Macron underscores the importance of international collaboration in addressing the crisis, with Kenya calling for an emergency East African Community summit to discuss the situation.

Ruto met with Kiraitu Murungi, a prominent politician from the Mt Kenya East region, to discuss 'national and regional matters'. Murungi's visit has sparked speculation that Ruto may appoint him as the next public service cabinet secretary. Political analyst Kelvin Ochol says Ruto is 'politically desperate and restless to regain his lost popularity' in the Mt Kenya region, and will employ every strategy to garner support from those who voted for him in 2022. Ruto's allies are also talking recklessly, saying they will use every means to ensure their boss secures a second term in 2027, raising concerns about possible manipulation of the electoral process.

Ruto claimed that 'the only competition is between myself and my track record,' citing his efforts to improve the country despite facing challenges. He also mentioned that he has not seen any 'serious competition' yet. This bold declaration follows Ruto's recent efforts to solidify his bid to remain in power, including winning over former President Uhuru Kenyatta and his biggest political rival, Raila Odinga. Ruto has appointed several of their allies to key positions in the government, including John Mbadi, Hassan Joho, and Opiyo Wandayi. Despite this, several opposition leaders, including Azimio co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka and former Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang'i, have expressed interest in challenging Ruto in the 2027 polls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 12:47 PM\nSource:[viraltea.co.ke](https://viraltea.co.ke/ruto-says-he-will-win-in-2027-because-he-has-not-seen-competition)\n\n**The Competition is Between Me and My Track Record - Ruto to Kenyans [Video]**\nPresident William Ruto stated that his primary competitor in the 2027 General Election will be his government's track record, not his political opponents.

He said, 'As of now, the competition is between me and my track record. These other competitors I haven't seen them.' Former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua recently dared Ruto to visit the Mt.

Ruto's recent moves, including calibrated concessions and tactical maneuvers, aim to appease the Generation Z-led protests and strengthen his leadership. He has co-opted five ministers from the opposition Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), including John Mbadi, a respected figure within the ODM, who helped pass a revised budget that eased social tensions. However, Ruto's efforts are being undermined by the impeachment of Vice President Rigathi Gachagua, orchestrated by his own entourage, which has opened a new front in the traditionally loyal Mount Kenya region. Ruto's ability to maintain power until 2027 will depend on his ability to navigate the complex demands of a restless population, a reinvigorated opposition, and an unstable coalition.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[notiziegeopolitiche.net](https://www.notiziegeopolitiche.net/kenya-le-manovre-di-ruto-per-rimanere-a-galla/)\n\n**President Ruto Declares Economic Stability, Pledges Accelerated Development Projects in 2025 | Law-Order**\nPresident William Ruto has announced that Kenya's economy has been stabilized, allowing for the implementation of key development projects.

President Ruto pledged to focus on Kerio Valley, a region historically plagued by insecurity and banditry, and plans to ramp up infrastructure projects, strengthen public services, and address regional disparities in 2025. According to Governor Wisley Rotich, the newfound peace and stability in Kerio Valley is unlocking the region's economic potential after decades of underperformance.

Sudi dismissed claims of political instability, asserting that Kenya has never had a one-term president. He also criticized those slamming the Kenya Kwanza government over rising cases of abductions and those using social media to abuse the president. Meanwhile, Lawyer Miguna Miguna claimed that President Ruto's popularity is sharply declining in several regions, suggesting that his re-election chances are slim.

In contrast, he has been met with open arms and unwavering respect in Nyanza and Western. Ruto's charm offensive began a week before his former Deputy Rigathi Gachagua's impeachment started in the National Assembly. He has visited several areas in Nyanza and Western, including Kisumu, Siaya, and Kakamega, where he has launched development projects and promoted unity and sportsmanship. Political analysts believe Ruto is looking for new 'friends' after Gachagua seemed to succeed in inciting his community against Ruto's presidency. According to Mutahi Ngunyi, the plan will work because the Kikuyu community constitutes 30% of the country's population, and 70% of Kenya will vote for Ruto with a landslide in 2027 without Kikuyus. However, Prof Gitile Naituli notes that efforts to shape the 2027 General Election narrative will not succeed, as Kenyans have moved away from tribalism and are now focused on issues such as the high cost of living and human rights violations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2025 03:04 AM\nSource:[Standard Digital News - Kenya](http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001509069/ruto-shifts-focus-to-western-and-gives-restless-mt-kenya-wide-berth)\n\n**MP Kaluma: Ruto will be re-elected in 2027 if Raila does not vie for presidency**\nHoma Bay Town Member of Parliament (MP) Peter Kaluma has stated that President William Ruto will be re-elected in 2027 unless former Prime Minister Raila Odinga runs for presidency.

However, the World Bank has lowered its projection for Kenya's economic growth in 2025 to 4.7%, warning against tight macroeconomic policies. Geoeconomic expert Aly-Khan Satchu explained that slow growth results from economic headwinds, including taxes and high interest rates.

Despite claims of progress, critics argue that the administration has been largely stagnant, with taxes increasing, corruption persisting, and essential services being deprived. Ruto has outlined key reforms for 2025, focusing on addressing the high cost of living and making essential services more accessible. However, skepticism remains regarding Ruto's ability to deliver on this promise. 'We need to see real action, not just speeches,' said James Njenga, a trader in Nairobi. Ruto's 2025 strategy involves recalibrating his political alliances, including meeting with former President Uhuru Kenyatta to discuss national issues. 'It is normal and common practice for sitting and former Presidents to engage on matters of national importance,' Kenyatta said. Ruto's critics argue that beyond politics, his leadership will be judged based on his ability to implement policies that improve the lives of ordinary Kenyans. 'I wouldn't work for William Ruto. Whatever changes and whatever quality of people he gets; he will be the minister for everything,' said former Justice Minister Martha Karua.

Ruto's outreach to Uhuru, in particular, has raised eyebrows, as it may be seen as a tactical move to consolidate his power. Analysts believe that Ruto's decision to bring in Uhuru's allies to the Cabinet may be a strategic move to appease the Mount Kenya region, which has been critical of Ruto's leadership. However, some critics argue that Ruto's big tent government may be a sign of weakness, rather than strength. Ruto's biggest test will be aligning his short-term tactical maneuvers with his bigger 2027 re-election bid.

These include strengthening the independence of the Judiciary, granting financial autonomy to the Inspector-General of Police, and rolling out the Hustler Fund. Ruto also outlined his vision to enhance the livelihoods of all Kenyans through increased budgetary allocations to the Judiciary and the Women Enterprise Fund, as well as providing subsidised fertiliser to farmers.
