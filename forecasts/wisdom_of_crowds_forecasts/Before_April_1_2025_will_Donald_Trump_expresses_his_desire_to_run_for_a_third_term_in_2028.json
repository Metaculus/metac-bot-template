'Can I run again?', Trump joked during a Republican retreat in Florida last month. Trump has made similar comments in the past, suggesting that he might want to stay in office beyond his second term. 'I guess I won't run again unless you say: 'He's so good, we have to think of something else'', Trump said with laughter from lawmakers. Trump has repeatedly stated that this will be his last term, but his comments have raised alarm among his critics, who point to his attempts to overturn his 2020 election loss and his pardoning of rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. However, Trump has said that he will be 82 years old when his term ends, and seeking another term would clearly violate the Constitution. Some Republicans have argued that the 22nd Amendment, which prohibits a president from being elected more than twice, only applies to consecutive terms, but this interpretation is not supported by the text of the amendment. Others have suggested that Trump could run as vice president and then replace the president if they resign, but this is a complex and unlikely plan. At least one Republican in Congress has proposed a constitutional amendment to allow Trump to seek another term, but it has no chance of passing. Even if Trump tried to run again, a combination of election officials and courts would likely prevent him from appearing on the ballot. Trump's comments about a third term may be a way to maintain his influence in the future, as his time in office is coming to an end. 'He governs as if it's his last presidency, with nothing to lose', said Derek Muller, a professor at Notre Dame Law School.

Trump joked during a House Republican retreat that he might be allowed to run again, and has previously suggested he might want to stick around after his second term. However, his musings have sparked alarm among critics, given his history of trying to overturn the 2020 election and pardoning supporters who violently attacked the US Capitol. Trump has repeatedly said that this will be his last term, but some supporters have proposed a constitutional amendment to allow him to seek another term. Experts say that even if Trump attempted another run, a combination of election officials and courts would ensure that he stayed off the ballot.

Trump first floated the idea years ago, and has continued to mention it since taking office. Some Republicans, such as Rep. Andy Ogles, have been open to the idea, while Democrats have called on their GOP colleagues to rebuke the president's proposition. Trump cannot constitutionally run for president in 2028, but some have suggested roundabout ways he could serve a third term, including running as vice president and then assuming the presidency. Trump's willingness to stretch the boundaries of his executive power and disregard political norms has led some to take his idea seriously.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 12:14 AM\nSource:[MSNBC.com](https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-third-term-president-constitution-2028-rcna191719)\n\n**Trump's Third Term: A Possibility?**\nDonald Trump has hinted at the possibility of running for a third term as President of the United States, despite the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which prohibits a president from being elected more than twice. Trump has made several comments suggesting he may run again, including saying 'I suspect I won't run again, unless they do something. Unless they say: 'He's so good, we have to resolve it''. Trump's comments have sparked concerns among Democrats and some Republicans, who fear he may find a way to circumvent the Constitution and run for a third term. Some have suggested that Trump could run for Vice President in 2028 and then assume the presidency if the Vice President resigns or is unable to serve. Others have pointed out that the 22nd Amendment only prohibits a president from being elected more than twice, not from serving as president in some other way. Trump has denied any plans to run for a third term, but his comments have raised questions about his intentions and the possibility of him finding a way to stay in power beyond his current term.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 11:52 PM\nSource:[SinEmbargo MX](https://www.sinembargo.mx/4615377/trump-no-para-de-bromear-sobre-reelegirse-otra-vez-y-en-eu-temen-que-si-sea-posible/)\n\n**This is a Genuine Crisis**\nThe author argues that Donald Trump's ambitions to stay in office beyond 2028 are genuine and pose a threat to American democracy. Trump has talked about a third term at least three times since his inauguration, and his administration's recent actions suggest that they will disregard legal constraints if they want to. The author notes that Trump's supporters, including JD Vance, have laid the groundwork for disregarding legal rulings and have paved the way for a genuine Constitutional crisis. The author believes that Trump will disregard the rulings of a judge and set a new precedent that places all legal power in the hands of the Presidency, making the Constitution irrelevant. The author concludes that it is too late to stop Trump and that the country is at risk of becoming a fascist autocracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 08:45 PM\nSource:[thebanter.substack.com](https://thebanter.substack.com/p/this-is-a-genuine-crisis)\n\n**Donald Trump Leaves JD Vance Embarrassed When Asked If He Will Endorse VP as President in the 2028 Election**\nDonald Trump, the President of the United States, has stated that he will not endorse his Vice President, JD Vance, for the 2028 presidential election. In an interview with Fox News, Trump said, 'No,' when asked if he would support Vance, citing that it's 'too early' to make such a decision. Trump's comments have been met with ridicule on social media, with some users calling it 'brutal' and 'honest but still brutal.' Meanwhile, some people believe that Trump 'dodged the question' because he has no intention of leaving office, as he has expressed his desire to run for a third term. However, the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits a person from being elected to the office of the President more than twice. A Republican House member, Rep. Andy Ogles, has proposed extending the maximum of two elected terms, but the resolution was cleverly drafted to stop other living presidents from getting elected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 03:38 PM\nSource:[inquisitr.com](https://www.inquisitr.com/heres-the-full-url-version-of-your-title-donald-trump-leaves-jd-vance-embarrassed-when-asked-if-he-will-endorse-vp-as-president-in-2028-election)\n\n**Donald Trump\u2019s Scathing One-Word Answer When Asked if He Views J.D.

Trump's comments come as fellow Republican Tennessee Rep.

Trump said Vance is 'very capable' and doing a 'fantastic job', but emphasized that he has not made any endorsement. Trump has previously expressed his desire to run for a third term, despite the 22nd Amendment limiting a president to two terms.

Trump made the hint during a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast event, saying, 'I want to be here with you. And I have been here with you. And I do that despite the fact that they say I can't run again.' Trump has been suggesting a third term since at least 2020 and has received support from some Republicans, including Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.), who introduced an amendment to allow Trump to run for a third term. However, others, such as Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.), have criticized Trump's remarks as 'unconstitutional and anti-democratic.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 11:11 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-once-again-suggests-might-230621871.html)\n\n**Why Trump will (probably) run again for president in 2028**\nDonald Trump has been hinting at running for a third term as president in 2028, despite the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution limiting a president to two terms. Trump has been dropping subtle hints about his intentions, saying 'we'll go for another four years' and 'it will be the greatest honor of my life to serve not once but twice \u2014 or three or four times.' While it's unlikely that the Constitution will be changed to allow Trump to serve more than two terms, he may attempt to run anyway. Trump's supporters have shown a willingness to challenge constitutional precedent, and the president has a history of pushing boundaries. Even if Trump is not eligible to run, it's unclear who would stop him, given the Republican Party's support for him. Trump's biggest hurdle may be ballot access, but it's unlikely that a credible Republican would challenge him. Ultimately, Trump's decision to run for a third term will depend on his own desires and the political landscape at the time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[rollcall.com](https://rollcall.com/2025/02/05/donald-trump-third-term-2028-election/)\n\n**Trump Hints at Running for Third Term**\nAccording to CNN, former US President Donald Trump hinted at running for a third term during a Republican conference dinner in Florida on January 27.

I'd rather not get you involved in this.' This is not the first time Trump has hinted at a potential third term.

Trump, who is limited to two terms by the 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution, raised the possibility of a third term during a speech to Republican Members of Congress in Miami, Florida. Trump ally Rep. Andy Ogles has introduced a resolution to amend the Constitution, potentially allowing Trump to serve a third term if he wins two non-consecutive elections. However, the amendment would require significant political support to pass and has not made progress in the legislative process.

A Republican congressman, Andy Ogles, has proposed a bill to modify the US Constitution to allow Trump to run for a third term. Ogles believes this initiative is crucial for 'restoring the Republic' and claims that Trump needs more time to reverse the 'decay of the country' caused by the Joe Biden administration.

I think I won't be able to run again.' Trump has made similar comments before, but this time comes after a congressman, Andy Ogles, proposed a constitutional amendment to allow the current president to run again. Ogles argued that Trump 'has shown to be the only figure in modern history capable of reversing the decline of our nation and restoring the greatness of the United States, and he should be given the time he needs to achieve that goal.' Trump also defended his first week in office, taking 'over 350 executive actions' and criticizing his predecessor, Joe Biden, saying that his administration was 'a disaster' and that he was 'extremely incompetent.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 05:02 AM\nSource:[teleprensa.com](https://www.teleprensa.com/articulo/internacional/trump-bromea-republicanos-congreso-presentarse-tercer-mandato-2028/202501280502232016607.html)\n\n**Trump's Potential Third Term: A Proposed Constitutional Amendment**\nUS Representative Andy Ogles proposed a constitutional amendment on January 23 to allow President Donald Trump to run for a third term.

Ogles stated, 'This amendment will allow President Trump to serve three terms and ensure that we can maintain the bold leadership our nation so desperately needs.' Ogles believes Trump is the only one who can 'save the nation,' and therefore, he needs an additional four years in office. This proposal comes after Trump's previous statements, where he initially ruled out a third term in 2023, but later expressed openness to running for a third term in November 2024 if the American people wanted him to.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 07:29 AM\nSource:[regnum.ru](https://regnum.ru/news/3943263)\n\n**\u2018He wants his revenge now\u2019: Trump 2028 is shut down by the internet**\nThe idea of Donald Trump running for president for a third time in 2028 has gone viral on social media, with MAGA ally Steve Bannon suggesting it could be possible.

The event celebrated Trump's presidential win, particularly his gains in New York City, where he garnered 30% of the votes cast. Attendees, including Nigel Farage and Corey Lewandowski, praised Trump's choices for key agencies in the new administration. Trump's first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, warned that 'any individual who exceeded their authority under the Biden administration will be held accountable in the Trump administration.' Trump's longtime aide, Dan Scavino, thanked attendees for their support and said that they are the reason he's going back to the White House with Trump in 35 days.

Donald Trump has already served one term as president from 2017 to 2021. Therefore, his potential to express a desire to run for a third term in 2028 is based on his interest in returning to political life and the symbolic nature of such statements, as he cannot legally hold a third term. Historically, most presidents do not pursue or express a desire for a third term, but given Trump's previous actions and statements about election matters, this case could be different. Considering his unconventional political presence, an initial probability of 15% is reasonable for him explicitly stating a desire to run for a third term.",
