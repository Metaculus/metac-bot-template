The president plans to hold meetings with his Cabinet team between Tuesday and Thursday to prepare for the opening of the ordinary sessions in Congress. The speech will be televised during prime time, as it was last year, to reach a wider audience. According to sources close to the presidency, the speech will take place at night. Milei recently gave a speech at the CPAC conference in the United States, where he reaffirmed the alliance with the US and made several nods to President Donald Trump. He also expressed his desire to reach a free trade agreement with the US and announced that Argentina will join the policy of reciprocal tariffs. 'If we weren't restricted by Mercosur, Argentina would already be working on a mutually beneficial trade agreement with the US that wouldn't unfairly burden Argentine producers,' Milei said. He also stated that he would be willing to leave the Mercosur block if it was the only way to achieve a trade agreement with Washington.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 02:18 PM\nSource:[Radio Mitre \u270b\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\uddfc\ud83e\udd1a\ud83c\udffd](https://radiomitre.cienradios.com/politica/javier-milei-volvio-al-pais-tras-su-encuentro-con-donald-trump-y-se-prepara-para-su-discurso-en-el-congreso/)\n\n**Milei to Address Congress, Discuss Key Issues and Supreme Court Vacancies**\nArgentine President Javier Milei will meet with his Vice President Victoria Villarruel on Saturday night, marking the first time they have appeared together this year. The meeting comes after weeks of intense parliamentary activity. On the same day, Milei will address Congress, where he is expected to discuss key issues, including the vacancies in the Supreme Court and the opening of parliamentary sessions. Milei has stated that he will include a mention of the new Ficha Limpia project in his speech, which was not discussed during the extraordinary sessions. He also needs to decide whether to appoint Ariel Lijo and Manuel Garc\u00eda Mansilla to the Supreme Court or propose other names for consideration. The President has been advised by his advisors to complete the vacancies through a simple decree, as the only way to do so while the Congress is not in session. This would give him five days to make a decision. Milei's visit to the US, where he met with President Donald Trump, has given him a boost of support, according to his Chief of Staff, Guillermo Francos, who stated that Trump's comments were not 'pavada' and that it is a significant development. Meanwhile, Milei's sister, Karina, will lead a party event in Tierra del Fuego, where she will bless the local leader Agust\u00edn Coto, who was a candidate for senator in 2023. Karina is focusing on building the party's space and organization for the upcoming elections.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 11:11 AM\nSource:[noticiasdel6.com](https://noticiasdel6.com/tras-el-apoyo-de-trump-milei-retoma-la-agenda-con-definiciones-clave-las-vacantes-de-la-corte-y-la-apertura-de-sesiones-del-congreso/)\n\n**Javier Milei Prepares for Opening Speech of Congress Sessions**\nPresident Javier Milei is preparing to deliver his opening speech for the ordinary sessions of Congress on March 1st.

However, Milei faces a new challenge as he is suspected of participating in a cryptocurrency scam, which has put him under investigation by the Justice Department. This is a different scenario for both the president and the opposition, as Milei's previous speech was seen as a 'novelty' in social and political terms, but now he is facing his first corruption scandal.

Historically, he has referred to key political figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) and Nancy Pelosi numerous times in his public addresses. Given this historical pattern, there is a likelihood that he would mention either 'AOC' or 'Pelosi' in a major address. These references often align with his tendency to discuss prominent Democrats as a rhetorical strategy. Thus, I estimate an initial probability of 50% that Trump will mention either 'AOC' or 'Pelosi' in his address before Congress based on these historical trends.",
