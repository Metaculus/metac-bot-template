According to the Taiwanese army's social media post, '14 aircraft of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and 5 ships of the PLA Navy, operating around Taiwan, were detected before [1:00 MSK] today [February 9].' It is claimed that 12 of these Chinese aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, entering the northern, southwestern, and eastern zones of Taiwan's air defense. This comes after Taiwan announced plans to deploy US-supplied air defense systems in the north of the island by the end of the year. China imposed sanctions on US companies Teledyne Brown Engineering Inc, BRINC Drones Inc, and Shield AI Inc on December 3, 2024, in response to the US' preliminary agreement to supply Taiwan with F-16 parts and radar systems, which China saw as a threat to its territorial integrity.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0421\u041d\u0413 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 - \u0418\u0410 REGNUM](https://regnum.ru/news/3946462)\n\n**China's Naval Fleet Sails into the Indian Ocean, Leaving the US Surprised**\nThe Chinese Navy has sent a fleet of warships, including the 052D destroyer 'Baotou' and the comprehensive supply ship 'Gaoyou Lake', to participate in the 'Peace-2025' multinational naval exercise in the Indian Ocean. This move has caught the US by surprise, as it demonstrates China's growing influence in the region. The Baotou and Gaoyou Lake are a formidable team, with the Baotou being a 'steel fortress' and the Gaoyou Lake serving as a logistical support center. The exercise will involve a range of military operations, including sea-based replenishment, joint anti-piracy, search and rescue, and air defense. China's move is seen as a demonstration of its ability to participate in global maritime security and take on more international responsibilities. Meanwhile, China and Pakistan have signed a series of important agreements, including a cooperation deal to upgrade the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The upgraded corridor will serve as a symbol of comprehensive cooperation between the two countries in areas such as infrastructure, energy development, and industrial upgrading. China will also be able to expand its economic and political cooperation in the Middle East and Africa through the corridor. However, the project faces challenges, including external interference and threats from India and the US.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/856941189_121752850?scm=10001.279_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0.a2_5X162X1532)\n\n**Zhengzhou to Drive Foxconn's '3+3' Strategic Industry Transformation**\nThe 16th session of the 3rd meeting of the Zhengzhou People's Congress was held on February 8, 2025. The government work report proposed that by 2025, Zhengzhou will drive the implementation of Foxconn's '3+3' strategic industry transformation. In recent years, Foxconn's layout in Henan has been highly concerned. According to reports, Foxconn's new business headquarters was unveiled in Zhengzhou on April 25, 2023. Foxconn plans to continue to deepen its roots in Henan and accelerate the implementation of the '3+3' transformation development strategy, making the new business headquarters a core base and important benchmark for Foxconn's global innovation and industrial layout. The '3+3' strategic industry refers to three emerging industries: electric vehicles, digital health, and robots, as well as three new technologies: artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and new generation mobile communications. Over the past year and a half, Foxconn has continued to layout in Henan, with the Henan Provincial Government and Foxconn Technology Group signing a cooperation agreement to accelerate the promotion of new business projects. In addition to Foxconn, Zhengzhou has accelerated the cultivation of advantageous industries, focusing on electronic information as the '1st industry', gathering over 600 electronic information backbone enterprises, including superconducting, Foxconn, and Hanwei Technology, and forming a large-scale intelligent terminal, computing terminal, display terminal, intelligent sensing, and silicon wafer manufacturing industry chain. According to the report, by 2025, Zhengzhou plans to strengthen the electronic information '1st industry', accelerate the construction of projects such as the Hikvision intelligent manufacturing base in Zhengzhou and the Zhengzhou Hengxin 12-inch silicon wafer industrialization, build the Huawei Central Plains Regional Headquarters, drive the implementation of Foxconn's '3+3' strategic industry transformation, create a national advanced manufacturing industry cluster for intelligent terminals, and achieve an industrial scale of over 9000 billion yuan, accelerating the transition to a trillion-level industry cluster.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:01 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202502083313999111.html)\n\n**China Builds Massive Military Command Center, Up to 10 Times Larger Than the Pentagon**\nChina is building a massive military command center in Beijing, which will be up to 10 times larger than the Pentagon, according to the Financial Times. The construction, codenamed 'Beijing Military City', began in mid-2024 and is part of China's military modernization efforts, which include investing in new arms and projects to be implemented by 2027. 'The analysis of images suggests the construction of several possible underground installations connected by possible underground passageways,' said Renny Babiarz, former image analyst at the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, to the Financial Times.

The French defense minister, Sebastien Lecornu, and his Ivorian counterpart, Tiene Birahima Attara, are expected to attend the ceremony. This move comes as part of efforts to reorganize the French military presence in Africa. France has been withdrawing its military presence from several countries in the region, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, following decisions by the ruling military authorities. It is also set to leave Chad after the Chadian government canceled a military cooperation agreement with France in November. Senegal is also negotiating the end of the French military presence by the end of 2025. In contrast to previous withdrawals, the handover of the military base in Ivory Coast is being done smoothly and in coordination between the French and Ivorian armies. Ivorian paratroopers have already begun to deploy within the Port Boet camp since January, working alongside the remaining French forces. Despite the withdrawal of French forces, Ivory Coast remains a strategic ally of France in West Africa, particularly in counter-terrorism efforts. The 43rd Infantry Battalion, which was previously based in Port Boet, had around 1,000 French soldiers who participated in operations against jihadist groups threatening the region and the Gulf of Guinea. Although the base is being handed over, a small French presence will remain in the country, with a unit of around 80 soldiers remaining in Port Boet to provide training and technical support to the Ivorian forces.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 11:54 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2025/2/7/%d9%81%d8%b1%d9%86%d8%b3%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%b3%d8%aa%d8%b9%d8%af-%d9%84%d8%aa%d8%b3%d9%84%d9%8a%d9%85-%d9%82%d8%a7%d8%b9%d8%af%d8%aa%d9%87%d8%a7-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b9%d8%b3%d9%83%d8%b1%d9%8a%d8%a9)\n\n**China Accused of Building Massive Military Complex, 10 Times Larger Than the Pentagon**\nThe US government's intelligence agency accuses China of building a 10 times larger military complex than the Pentagon, west of Beijing. The location would serve as the Chinese government's command center in times of war. According to the Financial Times, US officials have been closely monitoring the site since its construction began in mid-2024. The intelligence analysts investigating the case have dubbed the project the 'Beijing Military City'. Satellite images obtained by the report, currently being examined by the US government, show a construction site of approximately 1,500 acres, about 6,000 square kilometers, 30 km southwest of Beijing. The images reveal that the area has deep holes that, according to military experts, will house reinforced underground bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during any conflict, including potentially a nuclear war. 'If confirmed, this new advanced underground command bunker for military leadership, including President Xi as head of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing's intention to build not only a world-class conventional force, but also an advanced nuclear combat capability', said Dennis Wilder, former China analysis chief for the CIA. The construction is taking place at a time when the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is developing new weapons and projects in preparation for its centenary in 2027. According to US intelligence, Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the PLA to develop the capability to attack Taiwan. The report notes that, although there was no military presence at the site, warning signs against taking photos or using drones could be seen in the area. One of the guards at the entrance said that entry into the construction site was prohibited. A former high-ranking official of the US intelligence services said that, although the current PLA headquarters in central Beijing was relatively new, it was not designed to be a secure command center. 'The main secure command center of China is located in Western Hills, northeast of the new installations, and was built decades ago, at the height of the Cold War', said the ex-official. 'The size, scale, and partially buried characteristics of the new installation suggest that it will replace the Western Hills complex as the primary wartime command installation'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 11:22 AM\nSource:[poder360.com.br](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-internacional/eua-acusam-a-china-de-construir-complexo-de-guerra/)\n\n**China Accused of Building Massive Military Complex in Beijing**\nThe United States accuses China of building a massive military complex in western Beijing, which is believed to be ten times the size of the Pentagon.

The site features 'deep holes' that will allegedly house reinforced bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during a potential conflict, including a nuclear war. US officials, both past and present, claim that the intelligence community has been closely monitoring the site, which is expected to be the world's largest military command center. The construction, which began in mid-2024, coincides with the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) development of new weapons and projects near its centenary in 2027.

C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's President Alassane Ouattara had previously announced that French troops stationed in the country for decades would leave. 'We have decided on the coordinated and organized withdrawal of French forces from C\u00f4te d'Ivoire,' Ouattara said in his New Year's address in 2025. He stated that this decision is part of efforts to strengthen the country's military capabilities. 'C\u00f4te d'Ivoire is ready to fully manage its national security,' he added. This move marks a shift in the 'Franco-African' system, which is facing a crisis as more French-speaking countries in Africa prefer to diversify their security partners and move away from traditional French military aid. France has had to withdraw its troops from several countries in the region, including Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger between 2022 and 2023. Chad and Senegal have also taken steps to reduce their reliance on French military aid, with Chad ending its bilateral cooperation agreement in November 2024 and Senegal calling for the closure of French bases and the end of foreign military presence.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[resumenlatinoamericano.org](https://www.resumenlatinoamericano.org/2025/02/06/africa-francia-cerrara-su-base-en-un-pais-mas/)\n\n**China Builds Massive Military Command Center, Raising Concerns of Large-Scale Conflict**\nThe People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China is building a new military command center in Beijing, which, when completed, will be at least 10 times larger than the Pentagon, the headquarters of the US Department of Defense. According to the Financial Times, the construction of the facility has raised concerns among Western intelligence agencies, who believe that Beijing may be preparing for a large-scale conflict. The newspaper reported that recent satellite images indicate that the project occupies an area of 1,500 acres, located about 30 kilometers southwest of the Chinese capital.

According to the Financial Times, the base, which is being built on a 1,500-acre site 30 km south of Beijing, will have underground bunkers and tunnels that can withstand a nuclear attack. The US intelligence community has analyzed satellite images and believes that the base will be at least 10 times larger than the Pentagon. The base is expected to be completed by 2027, which is the 100th anniversary of the PLA's founding. US intelligence has also reported that Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed the PLA to develop its capabilities to attack Taiwan before the base is completed. The CIA's former analysis chief, Dennis Wilder, said, 'If true, this structure shows not only China's conventional military power but also its intention to be able to counter advanced nuclear warfare.' The US National Intelligence Director declined to comment on the project, while the Chinese embassy in Washington said it was not aware of the details and that China is committed to peaceful development and defense policies. An expert on China, Renny Babiarz, said that the satellite images suggest that the base will have at least 100 underground facilities and could be used as an education center. However, a former high-ranking US intelligence official said that the base is likely to be used as a primary command center in the event of a war and could provide greater security against US-made bunker-busting munitions and even nuclear weapons.

Analysts believe this could be a site for building large underground bunkers to protect the top leadership of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in case of conflict, particularly in the event of a nuclear attack. Several current and former US government officials stated that intelligence is closely monitoring the site, which is likely to become the world's largest military command center, surpassing the Pentagon in size by at least ten times. The construction began in mid-2024, according to satellite image analysis. This project is taking place during a period when the PLA is working on developing new weapons and military projects ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2027. According to American intelligence estimates, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has set a goal for the army to develop military capabilities sufficient for a potential attack on Taiwan before that deadline. The PLA is also actively increasing its nuclear warhead stockpile and focusing on improving coordination between its various military branches.

According to Helmoed Heitman, a South African defense analyst, China wants to use the Sahel as a base to sell weapons and ammunition to the entire continent. China's weapons sales to Africa increased from $103 million in 2022 to $306 million in 2023, while Russian arms sales collapsed from $315 million to $102 million over the same period. China is also using its economic dominance in Africa to 'militarize and securitize' its policy, said Paul Nantulya, a senior analyst at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. The Sahel is 'rapidly starting to look like the African doorway' into Xi's vision, said Heitman, with China building more military bases and infrastructure around the continent. 'Africa has been a testing ground for PRC military and security involvement outside China's borders,' wrote the authors of a report by the Center for Naval Analyses. 'The politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) clearly regards Africa as vitally important to victory if a global war breaks out,' said Heitman. China's military training exercises with African forces have increased in scope and intensity in recent years, with a focus on preparing for military expeditions and furthering its geostrategic ambitions. 'A few years ago these exercises were light, and China didn't send anything special to the party, it was basically just public relations and military diplomacy. Now, they send their best people and high-grade weapons,' said Heitman. 'The Chinese deployed at least 1,000 troops and conducted land and sea-based training involving maritime patrols, search and rescue, and live-fire drills,' said Nantulya, referring to recent Chinese-led naval exercises in Africa.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 01:11 PM\nSource:[www.theepochtimes.com](https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/china-boosts-military-presence-in-africas-sahel-region-5796969)\n\n**China Strengthens Africa Strategy: Wang Yi Announces 10 Billion Yuan Military Aid, Deepens China-Africa Cooperation and Competes with the West**\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has announced a 10 billion yuan military aid package to Africa, training 7,000 African police personnel and inviting 1,000 African party officials to visit China. This move is seen as a significant signal of China's strengthened cooperation with Africa and its efforts to stabilize the China-Africa relationship, while also highlighting China's strategic layout in competing with Western countries for influence in Africa. According to Chinese officials, Wang Yi's recent visit to four African countries focused on implementing the outcomes of the 2024 China-Africa Cooperation Forum in Beijing. Wang Yi stated that China will establish a 'China-Africa Development Knowledge Network' and 25 'China-Africa Research Centers' as soon as possible, and will invite 1,000 African party officials to China for exchange, injecting new vitality into China-Africa party and state governance. China's aid to Africa has expanded to include police training, showing that Beijing's investment in Africa is no longer limited to the economic field, but has extended to the military and governance fields, further consolidating its all-round support for Africa. This aid is part of the 36 billion yuan financial support provided by Chinese President Xi Jinping to Africa at the 2023 China-Africa Cooperation Forum in Beijing. Analysts point out that this support not only helps African countries improve their military and security capabilities, but also provides China with strategic interests. Taiwan's Assistant Professor Chen Yi-fan said in an interview with Voice of America that China's goal is to 'train instead of fight', to master the political dynamics of countries that have received training, and to allow the People's Liberation Army to receive low-intensity military training abroad under the banner of 'peacekeeping'. China has been training African countries' peacekeeping capabilities and logistics cooperation since 2003, with the aim of protecting Chinese overseas interests. Later, it expanded to establishing overseas bases and increasing military sales in Africa. China's overseas interests include the safety of Chinese citizens in Africa during social unrest, as seen in the 2023 evacuation of Chinese citizens from Sudan. China has also been building infrastructure and ports in Africa, including in Namibia, Tanzania, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, which have been rumored to be potential sites for China's second overseas military base. In 2017, China established its first overseas military base in Djibouti. China has also held large-scale joint military exercises with Tanzania in July 2024, simulating the deployment of the People's Liberation Army's Y-20 large transport aircraft overseas. Since 2008, China has been continuously conducting escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and the Somali waters, enhancing its overseas deployment capabilities. Analysts point out that these moves demonstrate that the Communist Party is building a multi-layered framework for power projection in Africa, combining economic, diplomatic, and military means to gradually enhance its influence and control in Africa and its surrounding regions. Taiwan's Assistant Research Fellow Yang Yi-wei said that China's goal is to pursue a global hegemony, and that military overseas deployment is a basic condition for this. He added that China's investments in Africa also reflect its intention to use asymmetric strategies to counter the United States, by building infrastructure, investing in the economy, and providing military aid, to penetrate deep into Africa's interior, avoid direct confrontation with the United States in the Indo-Pacific region, and divert US resources, preparing for the worst-case scenario of a US-China military conflict. 'This is a bit like the early Mao Zedong's strategy of 'you fight yours, I fight mine', to divide US resources.' Despite China's debt trap problems in Africa, some African countries are still unable to resist China's allure. According to estimates, China's loans to Africa from 2000 to 2023 exceeded $170 billion, making many countries dependent on China and creating a lever. Taiwan's Assistant Professor Chen Yi-fan analyzed that African countries need infrastructure construction, and China's loans and aid are more stable and non-interfering than those of Western countries, making African countries choose to cooperate with China in international options that are limited. Taiwan's Assistant Research Fellow Yang Yi-wei also believes that African countries have limited options for external relations. China is more stable and predictable than other Western countries in its China-Africa relations. He said: 'African countries' political elites know China's problems, but when they seek alternative options or schemes to replace cooperation with China, they may find opportunities are very limited, and they may still have to choose to cooperate with China.' Traveling commentator Cai Shen-kun said that China's allure in Africa is mainly due to its ability to benefit a small number of interest groups, which is different from Western countries. He said: 'Western countries bring in funds and at the same time bring in Western values, such as equality and the ability to speak out, or to treat the poor well. Western countries in this regard, that is, they cultivate a very small number of interest groups to share, is different.' However, China's model also brings concerns. Africa has been trapped in China's debt trap, with numerous examples, such as Kenya's Mombasa-Nairobi railway, whose operating income cannot cover loan interest; Zambia became the first African country to default on its debt in 2020; and although not in Africa, Sri Lanka's Hambantota Port, leased to China for 99 years, has made African countries worry about similar situations happening in Africa, leading to China possibly controlling African ports for a long time and even further eroding national sovereignty. This year's G20 in South Africa may be a turning point? Compared to China's active actions, Western countries' presence in Africa seems to be lagging behind. The United States, due to its democratic supervision mechanism and diplomatic priority order, is unable to invest in Africa as flexibly as China. Even if the United States implements the 'African Growth and Opportunity Act' (AGOA) and other policies, it has not been able to prevent African countries from moving closer to China. However, in 2025, South Africa will host the G20 summit, which may provide an opportunity for the United States to adjust its relations with Africa. Yang Yi-wei believes that the new US President Trump is likely to attend the G20 summit in South Africa this year, which may be a turning point, as Trump did not visit Africa during his previous term, and if he can attend the G20 summit to re-adjust US relations with South Africa and other African countries, it will be a key point to watch in the future. However, Taiwan's Assistant Professor Chen Yi-fan has a different view. He believes that Trump's interest in Africa is limited, and he may even cancel US tariffs on Africa, and the internal divisions and uncertainty of the Republican Party's policy on South Africa may continue to weaken US influence in Africa, making African countries feel anxious. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 03:58 AM\nSource:[\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3](https://www.voachinese.com/a/ccp-accumulating-overseas-military-projection-capabilities-in-africa/7935573.html)\n\n**China: War in Two Years or Less**\nChina's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is preparing for a potential invasion of Taiwan by 2027, as indicated by satellite photos showing mobile harbors being built in southern China. Former U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Phil Davidson warned in 2021 that China is accelerating its ambitions to supplant the U.S. and that Taiwan is a key target before 2027. The PLA has been making significant strides in modernizing its navy and air force, and has publicly stated its goal of achieving 'greater strength and self-reliance in science and technology' by 2027. As CDR Sal noted, 'Yes, the demographics of 2027. Yes, the passing intersection of military and economic power ~2027,' warning that war is likely to break out in the next six years. The construction of mobile harbors, similar to those built for D-Day, indicates that China is serious about its plans and may no longer be deterrable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 09:07 AM\nSource:[pjmedia.com](https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2025/01/13/china-war-in-two-years-or-less-n4935913)\n\n**China to Provide 1 Billion Yuan in Free Military Aid to Africa**\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced that China will provide 1 billion yuan (approximately $143 million USD) in free military aid to Africa to help train 6,000 military personnel and 1,000 law enforcement officers. Wang Yi stated, 'China will firmly support Africans in solving African problems in an African way.'

China opposes external interference in African countries' internal affairs and supports the African Union and regional organizations in playing a constructive role. Wang Yi also revealed that China will provide 1 billion yuan in free military aid to help African countries build their peace and security capabilities, train 6,000 military personnel and 1,000 law enforcement officers, and support the construction of African standby forces and rapid response units. China will also support African countries in conducting peacekeeping and counter-terrorism operations. China and Nigeria have agreed to implement the 'Ten Major Cooperation Actions' announced at the China-Africa Summit last year, with China providing 360 billion yuan in funding support. Nigeria is one of China's main trade partners in sub-Saharan Africa, with bilateral trade reaching $226 billion in 2023.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 07:10 AM\nSource:[std.stheadline.com](https://std.stheadline.com/realtime/article/2046323/%E5%8D%B3%E6%99%82-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%AE%A3%E5%B8%83-%E5%B0%87%E5%90%91%E9%9D%9E%E6%B4%B2%E6%8F%90%E4%BE%9B10%E5%84%84%E5%85%83%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E5%B9%A3%E7%84%A1%E5%84%9F%E8%BB%8D%E4%BA%8B%E6%8F%B4%E5%8A%A9)\n\n**China to Provide 10 Billion Yuan in Free Military Aid to Africa**\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced on January 9 that China will provide 10 billion yuan (approximately 45 billion NTD) in free military aid to African countries. This aid will help train 6,000 military personnel and 1,000 law enforcement officers. Wang Yi stated that China will 'firmly support the African people to solve African problems in an African way' and will not allow external forces to interfere in the internal affairs of African countries. He also emphasized that China will support the African Union and regional organizations in playing a constructive role, and will strengthen the leadership of major African countries to promote dialogue and negotiation to resolve conflicts and disputes. Wang Yi said that China will 'firmly support Africa's efforts to build its peace and security capabilities' and will establish a partnership with African countries to implement the Global Security Initiative, create a demonstration zone for cooperation, and promote joint actions for security. He also stated that China will continue to support the construction of African standby forces and rapid reaction forces, and will support African countries in conducting peacekeeping and counter-terrorism operations. Wang Yi emphasized that China will 'firmly support Africa to safeguard its legitimate interests' and will practice true multilateralism, 'not allowing hegemonism and power politics to stir up trouble in Africa.' China will always vote in favor of African countries in the UN Security Council and will speak up for their reasonable demands in multilateral forums. As the second-largest contributor to UN peacekeeping efforts, China will continue to support UN peacekeeping operations in Africa. Wang Yi also stated that China will 'firmly support Africa to achieve security through development' and will work with African countries to launch the 'Ten Major Cooperation Actions' to utilize the 36 trillion yuan (approximately 1.62 trillion NTD) in funding announced at the China-Africa Summit to deepen cooperation in various fields and help African countries eliminate 'unsafe soil' and achieve long-term peace and stability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 05:28 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/acn/202501100128.aspx)\n\n**China's Priorities for Sino-African Relations in 2025**\nA report by the Africa Strategic Studies Center, titled 'Expectations of Sino-African Relations in 2025', states that African countries will seek to re-evaluate their strategic partnerships with China to enhance their interests. The report highlights China's plan of action for the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum (2025-2027), which aims to coordinate China's and Africa's positions in multilateral institutions and to mobilize African participation in the alternative institutional frameworks established by Beijing over the past two decades. The report notes that the visit by the Chinese Foreign Minister to several African countries is a priority for China, as it has been since 1991, and that this visit comes after the 9th Summit of the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum in September, which reinforced the political measures announced during a meeting in China to define a set of goals, including the promotion of global supply chains for China, the completion of military modernization, and other goals in which African countries play a central role. The report also states that the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum is China's oldest, largest, and most regular mechanism for promoting its global influence, and that its new plan includes ten programs, including manufacturing, expanding Chinese free trade zones, and security and military cooperation. The report notes that the latest edition of this forum was followed by visits by senior Chinese officials to Kenya, Malawi, Seychelles, Tanzania, South Africa, and Zambia, while the Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Xi Jinping, visited Morocco to support the new programs of the forum. The report states that 'Africa is of great importance to China for controlling global clean energy supply chains', highlighting that Chinese companies represent 8% of total African mining production, which is much lower than that of Western companies, but that Chinese ownership of mines in Africa has increased by 21% since 2019, and that Chinese companies acquired major mining projects in several African countries last year. The report emphasizes that China's portfolio of port projects is crucial for these supply chains, as Chinese companies are involved in 62 port projects in Africa, including four in North Africa, and that these projects include the renovation of the Tanzania-Zambia railway line, which stretches for 1860 kilometers and ends in Dar es Salaam, the operation of the new container terminal in the Egyptian port of Dekhela, the operation of the Lekki port in Nigeria, and the operation of the Abu Qir port in Egypt through an agreement with the Egyptian Navy. The report also states that the Chinese-African Cooperation Forum's plan includes 'training 1000 African party officials and organizing regular visits to parliaments and local governments, as the Communist Party of China has held meetings with senior party and government leaders in several countries, including Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, South Africa, and has attended around 15 seminars organized by the International Academy of Commercial Officials under the Chinese Ministry of Commerce'. The report highlights that 'African countries must implement structural and policy reforms to develop value chains, but these reforms will require corresponding measures from China, given its position as Africa's largest trading partner', noting that 'some African leaders are seeking to adopt a Chinese policy to reduce and eliminate the import of unprocessed African goods, while others want more targeted Chinese investments in African manufacturing; meanwhile, the infrastructure bet remains in Africa in 2025, especially in light of China's commitment to complete 30 infrastructure projects by 2027, but it is still unclear how these projects will be prioritized, selected, and funded'. \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 01:02 AM\nSource:[Hespress](https://www.hespress.com/%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B6%D8%B1-%D8%A2%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7-1494906.html)\n\n**China Continues Shopping Spree in Africa as France is Pushed Out**\nChina continues its shopping spree in Africa while France is being pushed out, even from the Ivory Coast. The African continent remains at the center of global attention, reflecting the shift in global geopolitical balances. In recent weeks, the Chinese Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, has been on an official visit to four African countries, accompanied by a group of Chinese businessmen ready to sign commercial agreements. Namibia, Nigeria, Chad, and the Republic of the Congo are the four destinations of Wang Yi, who is tasked by Chinese President Xi Jinping to strengthen Beijing's already deep presence in Africa. Africa, China's first commercial partner. This confirms the tradition of inaugurating the year with a series of visits to Africa, a custom that has allowed China to become the continent's first commercial partner and take the place of Western powers that, over the past 25 years, have watched almost helplessly as Chinese influence in Africa has grown. In the course of the years, diplomatic visits have strengthened ties and overseen the establishment of the China-Africa Cooperation Forum (FOCAC), which has become a fundamental geopolitical appointment. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has announced that this year's trip will include discussions on major economic partnerships in the four African countries chosen. France pushed out of three countries. While China is welcomed with full honors, France is being pushed out of the Ivory Coast. One of the last bastions of French power in Africa, the country's president has declared that French troops must leave Ivorian bases by January and hand them over to the national army, which will no longer be trained by French soldiers. A surprising move, given that President Alassane Outtara has always been a loyal ally of Paris and has allowed French companies to thrive in the Ivory Coast. This move seems to be a prelude to the upcoming 2025 elections in the Ivory Coast, in which the incumbent president has not yet announced whether he will participate. In recent months, Chad and Senegal have also announced the departure of French soldiers from their territory by 2025. France has already handed over a first base in northern Chad, while in Senegal it is seeking a deal with the government of President Bassirou Diomaye Faye, who has said he is unshakeable on the removal of French troops from the national territory and especially from the vital port of Dakar. After the French were pushed out of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, which fell into Russian hands, the domino effect has been irreversible. The closure of bases and the expulsion of soldiers is, of course, a prelude to the demolition of the economic system built by the French, which could even see a change of currency to definitively free African states from Paris's dominance.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[ilriformista.it](https://www.ilriformista.it/la-cina-continua-lo-shopping-in-africa-mentre-la-francia-viene-cacciata-anche-dalla-costa-davorio-451761/)\n\n**China\u2019s Military Intervention in Africa**\nChina's military presence in Africa is expanding, with the establishment of a PLA overseas base in Djibouti and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) involving 53 African countries. China provides military equipment to African nations, including aircraft, ammunition, armored vehicles, and drones, often at competitive prices and bundled with flexible financing arrangements and military cooperation. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), China's arms exports to Sub-Saharan Africa have been substantial, with 21 countries receiving large deliveries between 2019 and 2023. China's military sales to Africa have generated significant revenue, with an estimated seven in 10 African armies now using Chinese-made armored vehicles. China's strategy in Africa is part of its broader Global Security Initiative (GSI), which aims to expand its global influence and reshape the international security order. China is also offering military training opportunities in Africa through the Chinese Professional Military Education (PME) program, which advances China's governance model and reinforces political and military relationships. There are concerns that China's military aid is often used to protect its investments and gain military experience, rather than solely for humanitarian purposes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 16, 2024 05:00 AM\nSource:[moderndiplomacy.eu](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/12/16/chinas-military-intervention-in-africa/)\n\n",
