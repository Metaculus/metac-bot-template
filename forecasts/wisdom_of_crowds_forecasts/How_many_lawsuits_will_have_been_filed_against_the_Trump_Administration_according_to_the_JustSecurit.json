Unlike the early days of Trump's first term (2017-2021), there has been little significant resistance in the streets, Congress, or within the Republican Party. For now, lawyers say, the judiciary may be the last line of defense. 'The judiciary may be the last bastion of resistance,' said a lawyer, implying that the courts may be the only institution capable of checking the president's power.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 03:12 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/mundo/noticia/2025/02/10/entenda-como-os-tribunais-federais-dos-eua-podem-ser-a-ultima-linha-de-defesa-contra-decretos-de-trump.ghtml)\n\n**Why Federal Courts May Be the Last Bulwark Against Trump**\nMore than 40 lawsuits have been filed against President Donald Trump's executive actions, with state attorneys general, unions, and nonprofits seeking to erect a bulwark in the federal courts. The lawsuits aim to block Trump's orders on issues such as automatic citizenship for babies born to immigrants, transferring transgender female inmates to male-only prisons, and exposing the identities of FBI personnel who investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Judges have issued temporary restraining orders and injunctions, but the executive branch is pushing back, with Vice President JD Vance suggesting that judges do not have the final say. The attorneys general say they are prepared for a long battle, with some calling it a 'constitutional crisis.' 'Unbounded power is the antithesis of the U.S. Constitution,' said Judith Resnik, a professor at Yale Law School.

Trump claims that American citizens want to uncover wasteful government spending, and Musk, as the head of the government efficiency department (DOGE), will help achieve this goal. Trump has called for investigations into the education department and the military, saying, 'I will tell Musk to start the investigation into the education department within 24 hours, and then we will investigate the military.' National Security Interview Mike Waltz has also said that the Pentagon's shipbuilding processes may be within the scope of DOGE's investigation. Musk has been appointed as a 'special government employee' by the White House, and his main tasks include reducing the size of the Federal Task Force and cutting unnecessary expenses. However, there are legal disputes over Musk's decisions, including his attempts to access sensitive information in government computer systems. Over 40 lawsuits have been filed against the Trump administration's controversial actions, including the restriction of birthright citizenship.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 06:54 PM\nSource:[hindi](https://www.abplive.com/news/india/us-president-donald-trump-claims-musk-will-help-uncover-government-fraud-2880944)\n\n**More than three dozen lawsuits filed against Trump actions**\nFederal judges have been blocking President Trump's directives to reshape the government, issuing a series of rulings that have halted his agenda.

US District Court Judge Carl Nichols issued a temporary restraining order on February 8, 2025, preventing the Trump administration and the Office of Management and Budget from placing USAID employees on unpaid leave. The order also requires the reinstatement of 500 employees who have already been placed on unpaid leave and prohibits the forced return of USAID employees working abroad by February 14, 2025. The Trump administration had planned to drastically reduce the number of USAID employees from 14,000 to 300 due to budget cuts. The Foreign Service Labor Union and the Federal Employees Union filed a lawsuit against the US government, arguing that the Trump administration was attempting to systematically dismantle USAID without congressional approval. 'The President has determined that there is corruption and waste at USAID, and therefore, immediate action is necessary,' said Brett Shumate, Acting Deputy Attorney General. 'The President does not need to explain to the plaintiff or the court how he intends to conduct foreign policy. Tonight, immediate action is necessary to prevent taxpayer dollars from being diverted overseas,' he added. The plaintiffs argued that the Trump administration's plan would cause 'thousands of American jobs to disappear, global crises to unfold, and a serious threat to national security.' \nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 07:59 PM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/international/america/1181422.html)\n\n**Trump Administration Faces Lawsuit Over Data Distribution**\nA coalition of 19 Democratic state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.

The ruling also grants affected employees access to email, payment, and security notification systems until February 14. A longer-term pause is set to be considered at a hearing on Wednesday. The move comes after US President Donald Trump suspended all US foreign aid for a three-month review, citing concerns over wasteful spending and alleged corruption within the agency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 09:46 AM\nSource:[rt.com](https://www.rt.com/news/612377-judge-blocks-usaid-trump-workers/)\n\n**Lawsuits multiply against Trump barrage of orders as Democrats struggle to fight back**\nPresident Donald Trump has issued a series of executive orders since his second inauguration, sparking controversy and lawsuits. The orders have targeted various institutions, including the Department of Justice, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). Trump's administration has also been accused of flouting the law and violating federal privacy laws. Democrats have struggled to fight back, with protests and lawsuits emerging in response to the president's actions. The federal courts have become a key obstacle to some of Trump's more provocative moves, with several judges blocking his orders. The Trump administration has defended its actions, citing the president's commitment to making government more accountable and efficient. However, critics argue that the orders are unconstitutional and will have far-reaching consequences for the country. The situation has sparked a debate over the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government. As of February 7, 37 lawsuits have been lodged against the administration, with more expected to follow.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[georgiarecorder.com](https://georgiarecorder.com/2025/02/07/dc/lawsuits-multiply-against-trump-barrage-of-orders-as-democrats-struggle-to-fight-back/)\n\n**Here are the lawsuits targeting Trump's executive orders - Washington Examiner**\nPresident Donald Trump has issued nearly 50 executive orders since the start of his second term, but they are being met with resistance in the form of lawsuits. As of February 7, approximately 35 lawsuits have been filed against Trump's executive orders, with several federal judges issuing preliminary injunctions and temporary restraining orders to block their implementation. The lawsuits target a range of issues, including Trump's efforts to limit birthright citizenship, his immigration policy, and his efforts to roll back federal programs. Trump has signed four orders targeting transgender policies, which have been met with legal challenges from civil rights groups. The National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education and other plaintiffs have filed a lawsuit targeting two orders that aim to bring back fairness and promote meritocracy over diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. The Trump administration has also faced lawsuits over its 'Fork in the Road' program, which allowed federal workers to quit voluntarily in exchange for several months of payments. U.S. District Judge George A.

As of February 7, approximately 35 lawsuits have been filed against Trump's executive orders, targeting issues such as birthright citizenship, transgender policies, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. A federal judge in Seattle has issued a preliminary injunction against Trump's efforts to limit birthright citizenship, and another judge has granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against the order. Trump's transgender prison order has also been challenged, with judges temporarily shielding four biologically male transgender inmates from being transferred from women's facilities. Additionally, lawsuits have been filed against Trump's order restricting federal funding for gender-affirming care for minors and his order instructing the Bureau of Prisons to house inmates in facilities corresponding to their birth sex. The National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, along with other plaintiffs, has filed a lawsuit targeting two orders that aim to bring back fairness and promote meritocracy over DEI policies. A temporary pause on the disbursement of federal grants and loans has also been challenged, with a judge issuing a temporary restraining order preventing the funding freeze from taking effect. Furthermore, Trump's order allowing border officials to turn away asylum-seekers without a hearing has been challenged, and a group of Chicago-based immigrant organizations has filed a lawsuit against the administration's guidance to the Justice Department instructing action against 'sanctuary cities' that prevent the arrest of undocumented immigrants. Finally, a temporary restraining order has been issued halting the Trump administration's 'Fork in the Road' program that allowed federal workers to quit voluntarily in exchange for several months of payments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[washingtonexaminer.com](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3312070/lawsuits-targeting-trump-executive-orders/)\n\n**USAID Closure Lawsuit Filed Against Trump Administration**\nThe American Foreign Services Association (AFSA) and the American Government Employees Federation (AFGE) have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to prevent the closure of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The lawsuit claims that the Trump administration's efforts to shut down USAID would cause a global crisis and result in thousands of Americans losing their jobs. The plaintiffs are seeking an injunction to stop the Trump administration's efforts to shut down USAID, and are also requesting that a temporary administrator be appointed, the buildings be reopened, and access to the agency's website be restored. The lawsuit argues that only Congress has the authority to terminate USAID. According to The New York Times, the Trump administration plans to reduce the number of USAID employees from over 10,000 to around 300. The remaining active personnel will be experts in health and humanitarian aid. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on January 21 to limit foreign aid, and the State Department announced on January 27 that all foreign aid programs would be suspended. Elon Musk, the CEO of DOGE, has also spoken out against the Trump administration's plans to shut down USAID, stating that employees have been placed on administrative leave and the agency's social media accounts have been closed. Trump and Musk have both stated that USAID should be shut down. Musk has criticized the Trump administration for making payments to the Associated Press and The New York Times, calling it a 'waste of taxpayers' money'.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 03:21 AM\nSource:[TRT haber](https://www.trthaber.com/haber/dunya/abdde-trump-yonetimine-dava-acildi-897055.html)\n\n**Here Are All The Major Lawsuits Against Trump And Musk -- As USAID Shutdown Sparks Legal Battle**\nMultiple lawsuits have been filed against President Donald Trump's administration and billionaire Elon Musk's efforts to trim the federal workforce, targeting policies such as birthright citizenship, asylum restrictions, and transgender military ban. Legal experts have expressed skepticism about the Trump administration's justification for nullifying birthright citizenship, with Georgetown Law School professor Stephen Vladeck saying it would be 'quite another' thing for the Supreme Court to give Trump 'the right to refuse to spend any and all money Congress appropriates.' The high stakes of the lawsuits make it likely that the Supreme Court will eventually weigh in on some of the challenges, although it's unclear how the 6-3 conservative court will rule. Trump has issued a number of major executive actions, including pulling out of the World Health Organization and rescinding Biden-era climate change initiatives, while Musk has drawn controversy for DOGE's access to government information and proposed cuts to spending. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has pointed to litigation as a key pillar of Democrats' response to the second Trump presidency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 02:35 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2025/02/06/here-are-all-the-major-lawsuits-against-trump-and-musk-as-usaid-shutdown-sparks-legal-battle/)\n\n**US Government Employees Sue Trump Administration Over USAID Shutdown**\nThe US Government Employees Union and the American Foreign Service Association have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration's severe crackdown on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), calling it a 'constitutional crisis that has caused a global humanitarian crisis.' The lawsuit seeks a court order to block the unconstitutional actions. Trump had previously stated that USAID has 'a lot of fraudulent behavior.' On February 3, the Trump administration closed USAID, ordered all overseas offices to shut down, and recalled all employees by February 7. USAID has over 10,000 employees, with about two-thirds working overseas. The agency has offices in over 60 countries and regions. Elon Musk stated on February 3 that USAID has 'no hope of improvement.' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on February 2 that the Trump administration tried to reform USAID but faced 'open defiance' and 'complete non-cooperation,' so they had to take 'drastic measures' to control the situation. Pompeo did not clarify whether USAID would be merged with the State Department. Trump signed an executive order after taking office, requiring a 90-day pause on all foreign aid to evaluate the effectiveness and consistency with the current administration's foreign policy, resulting in thousands of aid projects being suspended. As a result, about 60 USAID employees were asked to take a leave of absence on January 27. The Public Health Research Institute notified 600 employees on January 28 that they were being laid off due to the freezing of foreign aid projects. The USAID website was inaccessible starting from February 1.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 01:45 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/international/1000/20250207/47940472.html)\n\n**The Lawsuits Against Trump\u2019s Administration Are Piling Up.

The plaintiffs, who intend to represent a class of at least 6,000 current and former FBI agents and employees, claim that Trump's directive to purge FBI personnel involved in these investigations is 'unlawful and retaliatory' and violates the Civil Service Reform Act. They also fear that a Jan. 6-related survey will be used to identify agents to be terminated or suffer adverse employment action, and that their personal information may be published by Trump's allies, putting them and their families in danger of retribution. The plaintiffs argue that gathering, retaining, and disclosing their activities related to Trump's acts violates their First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and privacy rights.

Additionally, human rights organizations have filed a lawsuit against the order limiting the provision of US citizenship by birthright. The National Treasury Employees Union, representing the interests of employees of 37 federal agencies and departments, filed a lawsuit against President Trump, citing his order that simplifies the dismissal of high-ranking government officials. The lawsuit also states that the order will 'radically transform the public service' and lead to a significant increase in the number of employees at risk of dismissal. The White House responded by stating that the lawsuit was filed by 'leftists' and that 'the Trump administration is ready to meet them in court.' Human rights organizations have also filed a lawsuit against the order limiting the provision of US citizenship by birthright, stating that it contradicts the American Constitution. 'Citizenship by birth is part of what makes the US a strong and dynamic country,' said Anthony Romero, head of the American Civil Liberties Union. Trump entered office on January 20, 2025, and immediately signed nearly 200 executive orders, memoranda, and directives. His first act was to repeal 78 'harmful' orders by Biden and pardon 1,500 people convicted of the 2021 Capitol attack. Trump also declared a state of emergency on US borders due to rising illegal migration from Mexico and demanded the restoration of free speech in the country, repealing censorship.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 07:06 PM\nSource:[Forbes.ru](https://www.forbes.ru/society/529269-administracia-trampa-stolknulas-s-iskami-posle-ego-pervyh-ukazov-na-postu-prezidenta)\n\n**Multiple Lawsuits Filed Against Trump Administration on First Day**\nAt least three lawsuits were filed against the administration of US President Donald Trump on his first day in office, according to Bloomberg.

Another lawsuit was filed over the creation of the US Department of Government Efficiency, with Elon Musk as one of its chairmen. The plaintiffs claim that Musk's appointment may lead to conflicts of interest and transparency rules that are legally required for all agencies and departments related to the presidential administration. Trump revoked 78 executive orders issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden, and signed several new ones on his first day in office, including delaying the ban on TikTok, pardoning participants in the 2021 Capitol storming, and withdrawing the US from the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 04:32 PM\nSource:[Meduza](https://meduza.io/news/2025/01/21/protiv-trampa-podali-neskolko-sudebnyh-iskov-v-pervyy-zhe-den-na-postu-prezidenta)\n\n**And So It Begins: First Lawsuits Filed Against Trump Agenda**\nThe Trump administration has faced its first lawsuits, filed in a federal court in Washington, challenging the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) for violating transparency rules.
