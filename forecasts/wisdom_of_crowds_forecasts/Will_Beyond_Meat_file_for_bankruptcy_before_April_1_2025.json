The company, which has approximately 700 stores, will begin closing its locations after sales declined due to persistent inflation. According to court documents, Party City has retained over 95% of its 12,000 employees to assist in the liquidation process. Despite reducing its debt by nearly $1 billion and downsizing to around 800 stores in the US when it emerged from its first bankruptcy in October 2023, the company's problems resurfaced due to a triple whammy of inflationary pressures on consumers, rising wages, and online competition. Party City, which was acquired by senior lenders after its first bankruptcy, listed assets and liabilities of at least $1 billion in its Chapter 11 petition filed in Houston. The company's main owners are Capital Group, investment firm Davidson Kempner, and Silver Point Capital, according to court documents. Party City may sell its brand or other assets in Chapter 11, despite its intention to close its stores and operations. Bed Bath & Beyond sold its brand to online retailer Overstock after declaring bankruptcy and closing its stores in 2023. Party City, which sells everything from costumes to birthday cake decorations, reported a net loss of $91 million in the third quarter of 2023, according to its latest public statement. A group of bondholders guaranteed the company's privatization after restructuring. Party City is not alone, as some discount stores, including Big Lots Inc. and Dirt Cheap operator, have also filed for bankruptcy in 2024. Anagram Holdings, a Party City subsidiary dedicated to balloon manufacturing, filed for bankruptcy in 2023.

The company has been introducing new products, but the stock has lost value, with a recent pop after announcing Beyond Sun Sausage being short-lived. The financial performance has also been poor, with revenue growth declining on a year-over-year basis. As a result, insiders have been selling their shares. A bear call spread, a pessimistic trade, may be a tempting idea, with the potential for a quick yield opportunity. Selling the 3.50/4.00 bear call spread for the options chain expiring Jan. 3, 2025, could result in a maximum reward of $8 for every $42 at risk, a yield of slightly more than 19%.

The company is expected to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code, a restructuring plan under the control of its creditors. This move comes after Beyond Inc., a major financial partner of the company, canceled a planned $40 million investment due to insufficient financing conditions. The Container Store, which gained popularity in the past due to the Netflix series 'Tidying Up', has been struggling with a weak housing market, increasing low-cost competitors, and customers' shift to affordable solutions. The company had a long-term debt of $229.8 million in the third quarter of 2024. The New York Stock Exchange had begun procedures to delist The Container Store Group's common shares after they fell below $1 for more than 30 days, but the company's shares experienced a significant increase in October after Beyond Inc. announced a planned $40 million investment, along with a joint venture with The Container Store. However, Beyond Inc. canceled the deal just a month after expressing concerns about the company's ability to meet the financial requirements of the agreement.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: December 14, 2024 12:51 PM\nSource:[yenicaggazetesi.com.tr](https://www.yenicaggazetesi.com.tr/perakende-devi-iflasla-bogusuyor-bir-donemin-en-populer-sirketiydi-868665h.htm)\n\n",
