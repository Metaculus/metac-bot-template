Brody's previous win for Best Actor for his role in The Pianist makes him the only previous Oscar winner in the Best Actor category this year. If he wins, he would be two for two at the Academy Awards. A24's recent success in Best Actor, including Brendan Fraser's win for The Whale, could also help Brody's chances.
