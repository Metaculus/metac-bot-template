    "question": "Will the Trump administration impose new tariffs on the EU before April 7, 2025?",
    "description": "The new US administration under President Donald J. Trump is aggressively using new tariffs to achieve its policy goals. In the first month of his presidency, the Trump administration [imposed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/) a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico, which were both [postponed](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87d5rlee52o) after agreeing upon new border security measures. An additional [10% tariff](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/) was also introduced on imports from China.\n\nTrump has already [threatened](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zgx808g7o) the EU with tariffs at the beginning of February 2025, mostly because of the fact that currently, the EU imposes a [10% tariff](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/bmw-ceo-proposes-cutting-eu-tariff-us-vehicle-imports-25-2025-01-28/) on US cars imported to the bloc, while the US imposes a 2.5% tariff on the EU automotive industry, making US carmakers less competitive in the European markets. The EU also maintains [higher tariffs](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/transatlantic-trade-tensions-looming-us-eu-showdown) than the US on some agricultural products, such as beef and pork.\n\nIn 2018, the US [imposed](https://policy.trade.ec.europa.eu/eu-trade-relationships-country-and-region/countries-and-regions/united-states_en) tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum imports from the EU under Section 232 of the [Trade Expansion Act](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-76/pdf/STATUTE-76-Pg872.pdf), citing national security concerns. These tariffs [were lifted](https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/2021/biden-and-europe-remove-trumps-steel-and-aluminum) under the Biden administration, but on February 12 they [were reannounced](https://www.reuters.com/markets/eu-should-negotiate-avert-trade-war-germany-says-bloc-ministers-meet-2025-02-12/) by the Trump administration to be imposed from March 12, 2025.",

The measure aims to pressure manufacturers to set up factories in the US. The new tariffs escalate trade disputes with international partners. The European Union (EU) charges 10% tax on imported vehicles, while the US applies 2.5% on passenger cars. The US maintains a 25% tariff on imported pickup trucks, except from Mexico and Canada. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic will meet with US officials in Washington on February 20, 2025, to discuss the measures. Trump claims that the EU has signaled a reduction in tariffs on American cars, but European parliamentarians deny this. The tariffs on medicines and semiconductors will start at 25%, with increases throughout the year. Trump did not specify a start date for this specific surtax. The former president says he will give companies in these sectors time to establish operations in the US. Since taking office in January, Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese imports. He has also announced and delayed for 30 days tariffs of 25% on Mexican products and non-energy imports from Canada. Trump has also set a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum starting from March 12, 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 02:23 PM\nSource:[poder360.com.br](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-internacional/trump-impoe-tarifa-de-25-sobre-carros-remedios-e-chips/)\n\n**Trump Threatens to Impose 25% Tariff on Car Imports and Pharmaceutical Products**\nUS President Donald Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on imports of cars, as well as similar or higher tariffs on pharmaceutical products and semiconductors. Trump stated that companies would have time to relocate their factories to the US before new tariffs are announced. This is the latest announcement of Trump's plans to increase tariffs, increasing the risk of a trade war between the US and its global trading partners. Trump has used the threat of increasing tariffs as a lever to rebalance US trade relations, aiming to reduce the trade deficit and bring back the manufacturing industry to the country. The proposed tariffs are set to take effect in April, giving time for negotiations. The automotive and pharmaceutical sectors are two of the main exports of the European Union (EU) to the US. According to the US Census Bureau, the country imported $127 billion in pharmaceutical products in 2024, with a significant portion coming from the EU, particularly weight loss medications GLP-1, where Novo Nordisk's Wegovy holds a substantial market share. The Novo Nordisk stock fell 6% this year, following disappointing results and growing concerns about competition from its American rival Eli Lilly. The healthcare sector was one of the worst performers in the pan-European Stoxx 600 index over the past five trading days. European automakers may also face growing challenges if Trump imposes composite tariffs on products from Mexico and Canada. Large manufacturers, such as Volkswagen and Stellantis, have factories in both countries. Despite the threat of tariffs, European automaker stocks have been rising this year due to delays in Trump's action. In response to Trump's threats, particularly on car imports, the EU stated that 'no specific proposal for reducing tariffs has been presented by either side. Any reductions must be mutually beneficial and negotiated in a fair and rule-based framework. The EU remains committed to deepening transatlantic trade relations and resolving outstanding issues through constructive dialogue.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 12:32 PM\nSource:[euronews](https://pt.euronews.com/business/2025/02/19/trump-ameaca-aumentar-direitos-aduaneiros-sobre-mais-mercadorias-que-entram-nos-eua)\n\n**Trump raises threat of higher tariffs on more goods into the US**\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on auto, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor imports as soon as 2 April. Companies will be given time to relocate their manufacturing plants to the US before new levies are announced. This marks the latest escalation in Trump's tariff plans, further heightening the risk of a trade war between the US and its global trading partners. The EU has responded, stating that any tariff reductions must be mutually beneficial and negotiated within a fair and rules-based framework. European markets have been rallying this year, but may pause due to rising European government bond yields and US-EU trade tensions. Trump's proposed tariffs are likely to take effect in April, allowing time for negotiations. 'It'll be 25% and higher, and it'll go very substantially higher over the course of a year,' Trump said when asked about potential tariff costs for the two sectors. European car makers and pharmaceutical companies could face mounting challenges if Trump imposes compound import levies on goods from Mexico and Canada. 'No specific offer on reducing tariffs has been made by either side,' the European Union said in a statement. 'Any tariff reductions must be mutually beneficial and negotiated within a fair and rules-based framework.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 08:29 AM\nSource:[euronews.com](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/02/19/trump-raises-threat-of-higher-tariffs-on-more-goods-into-the-us)\n\n**Trump Plans to Impose 25% Tariff on Car Imports and Electronic Components**\nUS President Donald Trump plans to impose a 25% tariff on imports of cars, electronic components, and medicines. The new tariffs are expected to be announced on April 1, according to the Wall Street Journal. Trump said in a press conference at the Mar-a-Lago club in Florida that 'the tariffs will be around 25% on those industries, and may increase over time, significantly increasing throughout the year.' He added that he wants to give companies 'time to act' before announcing new import taxes, saying that 'US companies will be given time to consider what they import, giving them time to transfer production to the US,' without providing further details. The administration had previously said it would impose tariffs on those industries and others that it considers critical to national security, but Trump had not previously mentioned the level of the tariffs. Trump had previously imposed a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum, and had increased tariffs on Chinese goods by 10%. The new tariffs come after Trump's 'reciprocal' tariff measures, which the administration says will equalize US tariffs with non-tariff barriers and other trade restrictions imposed by other countries. A review of US trade policy is expected to be completed on April 1, after which the new tariffs are likely to be implemented. Trump suggested that countries may be able to negotiate lower tariffs, and said that the EU had agreed to lower tariffs on cars in response to his recent threats, a claim denied by the EU. Trump said he is open to other countries or blocs lowering tariffs, saying that 'that would put countries on the same playing field.' The EU's trade commissioner, Maros \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, is visiting Washington this week to discuss tariffs and other trade issues.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:20 AM\nSource:[asharq.com](https://www.asharq.com/politics/116767/%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B7-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%85-%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-25-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A9/)\n\n**Donald Trump Announces 25% Tariff on Vehicles to EU**\nUS President Donald Trump announced that the new tariff on vehicles to be imposed on the European Union from April 2 will be around 25%. 'I'll probably say it on April 2, but it will be around 25%', Trump said, reiterating his intention to impose these tariffs on the automotive industry announced on February 14. Trump added that tariffs on semiconductors and pharmaceutical products will be 25% or more and will increase 'substantially' throughout the year. He also stated that the EU has been 'very unfair' to the US, with a trade deficit of $350 billion, and that they do not accept US vehicles, agricultural products, or other goods. Trump emphasized that the US will 'correct this' and 'make it happen', without any doubts. This statement comes ahead of a meeting between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US trade officials on Wednesday to discuss Trump's decision to impose 'reciprocal' tariffs on EU VAT, aluminum, and steel.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 03:28 AM\nSource:[RTP - R\u00e1dio Televis\u00e3o Portuguesa](https://www.rtp.pt/noticias/economia/donald-trump-anuncia-que-tarifa-sobre-automoveis-rondara-os-25_n1635389)\n\n**Trump's 25% Tariff on Cars: A Risk of an 'Effetto Boomerang' for the US**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars starting April 2. He expressed satisfaction with the EU's reduction of tariffs on cars from 10% to 2.5%, which are now comparable to those in the US. Trump highlighted the injustice of the $235 billion trade deficit with the EU in 2024 and emphasized the need to address this issue. However, some analysts warn that the tariff increase could lead to a reduction in European exports to the US without guaranteeing an increase in American imports from the EU. Trump had promised during his campaign to revitalize the automotive industry, which attracted over 50% of the sector's voters. However, US car sales in Europe have historically been low, with brands like Buick and Cadillac failing to find a significant market. The EU has until April 2 to develop adequate countermeasures, and some agricultural and fashion products may be included in the definition of new tariffs. EU Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160efcovic stated that a solution beneficial to both parties will be sought, while maintaining the willingness to defend EU interests. Statistics show that trade between the US and EU is not as imbalanced as perceived by the Trump administration. In 2023, the EU recorded a trade surplus, but the US has a surplus in services. The two economies are highly interconnected, with reciprocal investments of \u20ac5.3 trillion, suggesting that a trade war could be detrimental to both parties.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 02:10 AM\nSource:[stranotizie.it](https://www.stranotizie.it/dazi-del-25-sulle-auto-la-promessa-di-trump-e-il-rischio-di-un-effetto-boomerang-per-gli-usa/)\n\n**Trump Estimates 25% Tariff on Cars, Plans to Impose on April 2**\nUS President Donald Trump estimated that the new tariff on cars, which he plans to impose from April 2, will be around 25%.

Trump explained that the tariffs will not be uniform, but will be set based on the tariffs and 'barriers' imposed by each country. 'We're basically charging what they charge us.

The EU has been threatened with new tariffs by the United States, in addition to those already imposed by Donald Trump on steel and aluminum exports. The US also plans to add a value-added tax (VAT) to imports from EU countries. The US has decided to impose reciprocal tariffs on its external trade, which means applying tariffs to purchases from its trading partners equivalent to those imposed on US exports. The US wants to impose tariffs on the EU in response to the VAT, which Washington interprets as a trade barrier. Trump has announced that he will soon approve tariffs on cars, chips, and pharmaceutical products. The US uses these threats as a tool for negotiation to reduce the large trade deficit it currently has. The reciprocity will not be strictly symmetrical, but will take into account all practices considered unfair by the US, whether regulatory, monetary, fiscal, or of another type. These estimates will be available from April. Trump claims that Europe has abused the US for many years. The US trade deficit with the EU closed at record levels, $236 billion in 2024. The relative strength of the dollar against the euro has made European products more competitive. These new tariffs will take into account five elements of disadvantage or economic abuse applied by trading partners to the US. As a response to this policy, the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, reduced tariffs on some imported goods and increased energy purchases from the US. In 2024, the US carried out a total external purchase of $3.29 billion and exported goods worth $2.08 billion. The trade deficit was thus set at a record $1.2 billion, compared to $1.06 billion in 2023. Nearly half of this difference corresponds to China, Mexico, and Canada. These decisions have created strong uncertainty in the global economy, and in Mexico, a suspense in some of the new national and foreign investments.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[pulsoslp.com.mx](https://pulsoslp.com.mx/opinion/union-europea-estados-unidos/1899638)\n\n**EU Prepares to Respond to Trump's Tariffs, Seeks Dialogue**\nThe European Union (EU) is ready to respond to US President Donald Trump's tariffs, reports 24 channel citing Bloomberg. Trump announced that on March 12, he will impose a 25% tariff on the import of steel and aluminum to the US, as well as new tariffs on cars, which may be announced as early as April. The EU is seeking to avoid a trade war with the US. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the European Commission, the executive body of the 27-member EU, invites the US to negotiations. 'We are ready for dialogue, and I am confident that it is better to achieve an agreement that will be beneficial for all,' Scholz said. 'It is essential to understand that Europe is strong enough to act and respond.' Scholz emphasized that the EU is strong enough to respond to any actions that harm the European economy, but always seeks to maintain the possibility of an agreement, as it is in the interests of all parties, especially across the Atlantic.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/economy/yes-mozhe-vidpovisti-mita-trampa-yaka-prichina-24_n2755059)\n\n**EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic to Meet with US Counterparts in Washington**\nEuropean Commissioner for Trade, Maros Sefcovic, will travel to Washington on Monday to meet with his American counterparts to discuss tariffs, according to the European Commission.

On Friday, February 14, Brussels denounced the intention of the United States to impose reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners as 'unjustified' and promised a 'firm and immediate' response. The EU Commission stated that this is 'a step in the wrong direction' by the new US administration. 'The EU will react firmly and immediately against unjustified barriers to free and fair trade, even when tariffs are used to question legal and non-discriminatory policies,' the Commission said in a statement. 'The EU will always protect European businesses, workers, and consumers from unjustified tariff measures,' it added. However, the EU Executive also stated that it is open to negotiations with Washington before the tariffs on steel and aluminum (25%) and previously announced tariffs enter into force on March 12. The US aims to reduce its trade deficit with the EU. The tariffs have not yet come into effect, but could start to be imposed in the coming weeks. The EU defends its tariff levels as being 'among the lowest in the world'. 'We see no justification for increasing US tariffs on our exports,' the Commission said. The EU also stated that it is 'one of the most open economies in the world', with over 70% of imports tariff-free. 'We are working to maintain a strong and stable relationship with the US, and we will not engage in a trade war,' said EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan. However, this firm stance hides a more pragmatic approach, which consists of negotiating with its US partner to avoid a trade war that would harm both parties. 'There is a window for negotiation,' said Irish Foreign Minister Simon Harris. South Korea has also announced that it will review its non-tariff barriers in its trade relationship with the US. 'Given that the US said it would also evaluate non-tariff barriers, including value-added taxes and digital services taxes, it is necessary to monitor the situation,' said Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 07:32 PM\nSource:[elmostrador.cl](https://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/mundo/2025/02/14/la-ue-advierte-reaccion-firme-a-aranceles-reciprocos-de-trump-pero-se-muestra-abierta-a-negociar/)\n\n**EU Vows to Respond 'Firmly and Swiftly' to Trump's Tariff Threat**\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the European Union will respond 'firmly and swiftly' to Donald Trump's threat to impose a global tariff on all trading partners.

Trump cited the EU's customs duties, including VAT, as an example of unfair trade rules that the US is seeking to respond to. Von der Leyen said in a statement that 'the EU will respond firmly and swiftly to unjustified trade barriers, including tariffs, that undermine free and fair trade.' She added that 'tariffs are taxes.' If the US imposes tariffs, it will be 'taxing its own citizens, increasing business costs, stifling growth, and fueling inflation,' she said.

Trump argues that current trade deals are unfair to the US, citing the EU's Value Added Tax (VAT) and digital service taxes imposed by France and Canada. The Trump administration believes that higher tariffs could bring manufacturing back to the US and pay for proposed tax cuts, but many economists have criticized the plan, saying it will likely push costs onto consumers and cause retaliatory tariffs. Trump stated, 'They charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them the exact same.' The new tariff code will require reevaluating hundreds of countries' current policies in less than two months, and the delay in instituting the new tariffs may signal that Trump is open to negotiating.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 06:03 AM\nSource:[morningbrew.com](https://www.morningbrew.com/stories/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-april-after-federal-study)\n\n**Trump Imposes 'Reciprocal Tariffs' on EU and Other Countries**\nUS President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum to impose 'reciprocal tariffs' on countries that tax US products, aiming to equalize the tariffs applied by those nations to US exports. The European Union (EU) is one of the main affected parties, along with China, Japan, India, and South Korea. According to Bloomberg, Trump's nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, has informed the press that the study on the measures to be taken should be ready by April 1, after which Trump will take action. Trump declared, 'I have decided that, for reasons of justice, I will impose reciprocal tariffs, which means we will charge the same as a country makes the US pay, neither more nor less.' The new tariffs will not come into effect immediately, but in a period of 'weeks' or 'months,' and the first to be punished will be those with which the US has the largest trade deficit, according to a high-ranking official before the signing of the memorandum. Trump stated, 'Everyone has taken advantage of the US and we have paid a high price for it. The US has helped many countries over the years at a great financial cost. Now it's time for those countries to remember what we've done for them and treat us fairly.' The document signed by Trump focuses on two aspects that, according to him, have generated an 'unfair' treatment for the US in international trade: the tariffs imposed by other countries on US exports and the so-called 'non-tariff barriers.' These 'barriers' include subsidies that favor certain sectors in each country, making it difficult for US products to compete, as well as 'excessive' regulations, especially in environmental matters, and 'manipulations' in currency exchange rates. Each nation will face customized tariffs, according to a White House official, who spoke with journalists before Trump's act in the Oval Office. No uniform tariff of 10% or 25% will be applied, but the Administration will establish specific rates based on the tariffs and 'barriers' imposed by each nation on US trade.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 14, 2025 04:35 AM\nSource:[confilegal.com](https://confilegal.com/20250214-trump-pone-en-marcha-los-aranceles-reciprocos-a-la-ue-para-compensar-el-iva/)\n\n**Trump Announces Reciprocal Tariffs, EU Faces New Blow**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose reciprocal tariffs on countries that tax American goods, a move that could harm the European economy and the US economy. Trump has instructed his trade advisors to develop a plan for the tariffs, which will be imposed 'country by country' starting with those with the largest trade deficit with the US. The tariffs are expected to take effect on April 2, according to Howard Lutnick, Trump's commerce minister. The EU is preparing to respond to Trump's move, but the dialogue remains the preferred option. 'Cooperation remains our preferred option. We remain committed to a constructive dialogue and to finding negotiated solutions, while protecting the interests of the EU, just as the US protects its own,' said the European Commission's spokesperson, referring to the recent meeting between EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, has warned that the new tariffs could lead to unfavorable trends in the fourth quarter of 2024. US businesses are also concerned about the tariffs, which could lead to higher prices for Americans and possible new inflationary pressures. 'I don't think prices will go up in the short term,' admitted Trump, who had promised to reduce inflation from 'Day 1' of his presidency. However, the President believes that tariffs are a necessary tool in any negotiation and a 'great policy' against countries that have 'robbed' the US for years.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 08:24 PM\nSource:[ticinonews.ch](https://www.ticinonews.ch/estero/trump-annuncia-i-dazi-reciproci-lue-rischia-un-nuovo-colpo-407777)\n\n**EU to Impose Counter-Tariffs on US Products if No Agreement by March 12**\nUS President Donald Trump plans to impose 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to the US, which will also affect the EU. The EU's response is expected on April 1, according to the European Parliament. Bernd Lange, chairman of the EU Parliament's Trade Committee, stated, 'If we don't reach an agreement by March 12 - we will certainly negotiate now - then from April 1, these counter-tariffs will be in place.' This refers to suspended tariffs on US products such as jeans, bourbon whiskey, motorcycles, and peanut butter, which the EU imposed during Trump's first term. The EU had previously introduced tariffs on US steel and aluminum exports in response.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 06:15 PM\nSource:[Kronen Zeitung](https://www.krone.at/3686731)\n\n**EU Prepares to Respond Firmly to US Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum**\nThe European Union is preparing to respond firmly to the new US tariffs on steel and aluminum. European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen has made it clear that the EU will not stand idly by. She stated, 'This decision leaves me deeply disappointed. Tariffs are taxes that harm businesses and weigh on consumers' pockets.' Von Der Leyen announced that the EU will respond with 'decisive but proportionate' countermeasures to protect its economic interests and safeguard European workers, businesses, and consumers. European Commissioner Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d echoed Von Der Leyen's sentiments, saying, 'This move is detrimental to the global economy.' \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d condemned the US tariffs, stating that they are 'unjustifiable and deplorable' and will only serve to fuel inflation, effectively imposing a hidden tax on American citizens. The EU's response will be 'tough and calibrated.' The US tariffs, announced by President Donald Trump, will increase by 25% and take effect on March 12, 2025. Trump justified the decision, citing 'national security threats.' He also hinted at possible new tariffs on cars, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors, escalating tensions in the transatlantic trade relationship.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 09:45 AM\nSource:[notizie.it](https://www.notizie.it/dazi-usa-sulleuropa-von-der-leyen-avverte-risponderemo-con-fermezza/)\n\n**EU Faces New Tariffs from US as Trump Announces Steel and Aluminum Tariffs**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, effective from March 4. This move is seen as a response to the EU's 2018 tariffs on US goods, including Harley-Davidson motorcycles, orange juice from Florida, and bourbon from Kentucky. The EU had suspended its tariffs in 2023, but they will automatically resume on April 1, 2025. The US tariffs will affect the EU's imports of steel and aluminum, which account for 15% of the EU's total imports. The EU is considering various options, including buying more liquefied natural gas from the US, increasing arms purchases from the US, and aligning its tariffs with those applied to US cars in the EU. However, these proposals have been met with skepticism, and the EU is still waiting for a response from the US. Donald Trump has also threatened to impose 'reciprocal' tariffs on EU goods, which could lead to a trade war. The EU has promised a 'firm response' if the US takes 'unjust and arbitrary' decisions.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 04:38 AM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2025/02/11/droits-de-douane-sur-l-acier-et-l-aluminium-l-europe-cherche-sa-riposte-a-la-decision-de-donald-trump_6541164_3234.html)\n\n**EU faces inescapable 'tariff dance' as Trump looms large**\nThe European Union (EU) may be the next target of U.S. tariffs, according to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. Knightley said that given the swiftness with which the Trump administration implements election promises, it is 'hard to see' how the EU 'could escape the tariff dance.' However, he noted that the EU would not feel the economic pain of U.S. tariffs until April, as many European car manufacturers have production facilities in Mexico. Knightley also suggested that the U.S. has a relatively small trade deficit with Turkey, running at minus $1.9 billion in the first 11 months of 2024, and therefore may not be specifically targeted with levies. Thomas Altmann from QC Partners said that it is unclear how things will go in terms of tariffs after Trump paused the customs duties for an initial period of 30 days. 'Whether they do go into force in 30 days, or whether Donald Trump wants to extract further concessions from both neighboring countries before then, remains open,' Altmann said. The EU has pledged to 'respond firmly' to any trading partner that unfairly or arbitrarily imposes tariffs on EU goods.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 11:10 AM\nSource:[Daily Sabah](https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/eu-faces-inescapable-tariff-dance-as-trump-looms-large)\n\n**Trump to Speak with Canada and Mexico Leaders Before Imposing Tariffs**\nUS President Donald Trump announced that he will speak with the leaders of Canada and Mexico before imposing a 25% tariff on the two countries on April 4. Trump stated, 'I don't expect anything dramatic to happen.' He emphasized that the US has already imposed tariffs and that Canada and Mexico owe the US a significant amount of debt. Trump expressed confidence that Canada and Mexico will pay the tariffs. Trump also hinted that the next country to be targeted with tariffs will be the European Union (EU). When asked about the timeline for imposing tariffs on the EU, Trump replied, 'We will definitely impose tariffs on the EU.'

Trump did not specify the level or timing of the tariffs, saying only that it will happen 'soon'. This is not the first time Trump has hinted at imposing tariffs on the EU, having previously stated that he would do so in January. The EU has warned that it will take 'firm action' if the US imposes tariffs. In contrast, Trump has avoided making similar promises to the UK, saying that he has a 'good relationship' with UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, stating that 'we're doing very well'.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 02:13 AM\nSource:[Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2025-02-03/SR30PUT1UM0W00)\n\n",
