The vaccine was approved by the FDA and will be shipped by the Serum Institute of India (SII) starting February 19, 2025. Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, Founder of ImmunityBio, said, 'With the increasing threat of supply shortages of essential medicines, the biopharmaceutical industry must innovate and secure new means of ensuring uninterrupted access to vital therapeutics.' The rBCG vaccine has demonstrated potent immunogenicity and improved safety compared to earlier BCG strains and formulations. ImmunityBio's ANKTIVA, a cytokine interleukin-15, plays a crucial role in the immune system and integrates with rBCG vaccinations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[precisionvaccinations.com](https://www.vax-before-travel.com/bcg-vaccine-shortage-ends-united-states-2025-02-19)\n\n**ImmunityBio (IBRX): FDA Authorizes ImmunityBio to Provide Recombinant BCG (rBCG) to Urologists to Address TICE\u00ae BCG Shortage**\nThe U.S. FDA has authorized an expanded access program for ImmunityBio to provide a recombinant BCG (rBCG) vaccine to urologists to address the shortage of TICE BCG in the U.S. The shortage has hindered the treatment of bladder cancer patients, with 57% of urologists surveyed unable to treat patients in the last 12 months due to lack of access to TICE BCG. The rBCG vaccine, developed by the Serum Institute of India, has shown potent immunogenicity and improved safety in European bladder cancer clinical trials.

Although not as widespread as in January, the problem persists. The Ministry of Health attributes the situation to the 'one-time' approach of beneficiaries in submitting prescriptions for 2024 and 2025. However, people wonder if the region's budget, which has reduced spending (e.g., by eliminating the subsidy for transportation for students), is connected to the shortage. The Ministry of Health responded that the number of people receiving subsidized medications has increased from 153,333 in 2023 to 167,580 in 2024, and 170,000 in 2025. The total cost of dispensing medications has also increased, from 4.37 billion rubles in 2024 to the same amount in 2025, despite a 2.5% increase in the number of beneficiaries and an 11% increase in medication prices. The Ministry has promised to deliver medications to patients' homes, including those with chronic illnesses, the elderly, and those living in remote areas. However, four medications are currently unavailable: clopicxol and methylprednisolone tablets, Humalog insulin, and Ionsoteryl infusion solution. Patients are advised to consult their doctors to find alternative treatments. The problem of medication shortages has been reported in many regions, with some even conducting investigations. In Kuzbass, the prosecutor's office has received complaints from citizens and has taken measures to ensure that patients receive necessary medications and are reimbursed for any costs incurred in purchasing medications themselves.

Sheinbaum assured that, starting from March, all medications will be guaranteed. According to her, a significant purchase was made for the next two years to resupply the shortage caused by the end of certain contracts with pharmaceutical companies in late 2024. The president mentioned that all medications will be free and not only cover basic diseases, but also more complex ones, including medical interventions. Sheinbaum emphasized that 'all insumos (medications and supplies) will be free and accessible to everyone' in the public healthcare system.

Several factors contribute to this increase, including the company's high-profile Super Bowl advertisement and growing investor interest in telehealth, particularly in weight management. The advertisement directly addressed the growing obesity crisis in America, portraying Hims & Hers' medications as affordable and accessible solutions. However, the commercial drew criticism from senators, regulatory bodies, and pharmaceutical industry groups, who questioned the ad's potential to mislead consumers and raised concerns about patient safety. Despite the controversy, the advertisement succeeded in capturing widespread attention and likely contributed to the surge in stock value. Hims & Hers has also strategically entered the GLP-1 weight loss medication market, offering compounded versions of semaglutide due to shortages of branded medications. This move has significantly impacted their financial performance, with a 77% revenue increase and a 44% subscriber increase in Q3 2024. The company's revenue growth remains a standout metric, with a substantial 77% increase in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Hims & Hers is also showing positive trends in profitability, with a net income of $75.6 million and an Adjusted EBITDA of $51.1 million in Q3 2024. However, the company faces regulatory risks, competitive pressures, and questions about the sustainability of its current growth drivers, warranting a cautious approach.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 12:15 PM\nSource:[marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-ideas/hims-and-hers-from-viral-ad-to-volatile-stock/)\n\n**Major Market Shift in Egrifta (Tesamorelin Acetate) Industry: Resumption Of Synthetic Peptide Drug Production And Supply Management In The HIV-Related Lipodystrophy Market**\nThe egrifta (tesamorelin acetate) market is expected to experience significant growth, driven by the increasing incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections.

According to Invima, the shortage is due to an increase in demand, problems in the acquisition of raw materials, and a lack of producers or laboratories that produce the medicine. The shortage affects various medicines, including Ataluren, used to treat a rare disease, and antitubercular medicines, which are essential for the treatment of tuberculosis. The Association of Infectologists of Colombia (Acin) has warned about the shortage of antitubercular medicines, which could have severe consequences for the fight against the disease. The Ministry of Health is responsible for acquiring these medicines annually to ensure their availability, but the delivery of the compound Rhze, which was scheduled for September, has been delayed until December. The shortage of medicines is a concern for the authorities and health organizations due to its impact on the treatment of tuberculosis, which remains one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in the country, especially in vulnerable populations. According to Invima, the main causes of shortage are: increase in demand, problems in the acquisition of raw materials, and lack of producers or laboratories that produce the medicine. The Invima has also reported that the following medicines are at risk of shortage: Enalapril tablets of 5mg, Hidroxiurea (Hidroxicarbamida) capsules of 500 mg, Lamotrigina tablets of 100mg / 50mg, Midazolam injectable solution 5mg/5m, and Fentanilo patch transdermal 8.4 mg and Fenilbutirato de sodio 48.3 g granules, which have been officially discontinued in the country since January 29, 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[hoydiariodelmagdalena.com.co](https://hoydiariodelmagdalena.com.co/archivos/1074547/se-agrava-la-escasez-de-medicamentos/)\n\n**Roszdravnadzor Recommends Alternative Therapy for Patients Taking 'Atento'**\nThe Roszdravnadzor (Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare) in the Sverdlovsk region recommends that patients taking the medication 'Atento' find an alternative therapy with the help of a doctor. The medication, used to treat essential hypertension, has not been available in the civilian market since September 2023, according to the Roszdravnadzor's website. However, the agency notes that there are limited quantities of the medication remaining in the region and that there are many analogs available on the market. This comes after the agency previously denied reports of a shortage of medications for hypophysis pathologies, stating that over 440,000 packages of the medications 'Lanreotide', 'Octreotide', and 'Pegvisomant' are available. 'The last time the medication 'Atento' was available in the civilian market was in September 2023. As a result, according to the information posted in the system for monitoring the movement of medicinal products, there are limited quantities of the mentioned medicinal product on the territory of the Sverdlovsk region,' the agency stated on its VKontakte page.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[m24.ru](https://www.m24.ru/news/obshchestvo/17022025/771174)\n\n**Rising Demand for GLP-1 Receptor Agonists Means an Increase in Patient Questions**\nThe demand for GLP-1 receptor agonists, such as semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza), has surged due to their effectiveness in weight loss and glycemic control. However, this increased demand has led to nationwide shortages, particularly for off-label use for weight management. Pharmacists are struggling to manage the distribution of these medications, and patients may face difficulties maintaining glycemic control. According to Dr. Mahapatra, semaglutide has shown positive results in clinical studies, with participants achieving an average weight loss of 15% to 17% over 68 weeks.  The shortage has raised economic and ethical concerns, with some patients facing inflated prices or resorting to secondary markets. Pharmaceutical companies are ramping up production, but it may take months or years to resolve the issue. Health care providers are encouraged to consider alternative therapies for patients affected by the shortage. Improved patient education is also vital to managing expectations and ensuring adherence to available treatments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 03:21 PM\nSource:[pharmacytimes.com](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/view/rising-demand-for-glp-1-receptor-agonists-means-an-increase-in-patient-questions)\n\n**\u2018Check before you inject\u2019: Novo bites back at Hims & Hers Super Bowl ad**\nNovo Nordisk has released a print ad in The New York Times criticizing the safety and efficacy of compounded GLP-1s, following a controversial Super Bowl ad by Hims & Hers promoting its compounded GLP-1 offerings. The Novo ad, which reads 'Check before you inject,' questions the quality of compounded semaglutide and highlights the potential risks to patients. Novo has been fighting against compounded GLP-1s for years, launching lawsuits and pushing the FDA to prohibit them from the market. The FDA allows compounded drugs if a patient can't be treated with an FDA-approved medication or if there are shortages of branded drugs. Novo argues that compounding pharmacies 'may call it 'semaglutide,' but it's not real FDA-approved medicine, and it's not proven safe or effective.'

The company plans to bring generic GLP-1, liraglutide, to the market in 2025. LifeVantage Co. has taken a non-FDA route and markets its 'MindBody GLP-1 System', a dietary supplement system that claims to increase the body's natural production of the GLP-1 hormone. LifeVantage reported fiscal Q1 2025 EPS of 22 cents and revenues rose 31.26% to $67.76 million.

Here's what to know**\nHims & Hers, a health and wellness company, aired a Super Bowl ad criticizing the high price tag of branded weight-loss drugs. The ad, which featured Donald Glover's 'This Is America' as its soundtrack, claimed that medications work but are priced for profits, not patients. The company's GLP-1 injections, which contain compounded or off-brand semaglutide, were briefly featured in the ad. Industry groups and lawmakers called the commercial misleading, but Hims & Hers said the backlash was an attempt to cancel an ad that directly calls out the industry's failures. The company's compounded weight-loss drugs are allowed to be sold due to Wegovy's current shortage. Hims & Hers offers the compounded semaglutide injections for $199 a month, hundreds of dollars cheaper than Ozempic and Wegovy. However, the FDA has warned about the risks of compounded formulations, which are not FDA-approved and have been linked to adverse event reports.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[qz.com](https://qz.com/hims-hers-compounded-semaglutide-ozempic-wegovy-1851759350)\n\n**More than half of pharmacies reported medication shortages in 2024**\nAccording to the National Authority for Medicines and Health Products (Infarmed), 80% of the 12,436 commercialized presentations did not experience any disruptions, while 17% experienced disruptions without any impact on patients, 3% had a moderate impact, and 19 had a high impact due to a lack of substitutes in the market. The Infarmed applied measures to mitigate the impact, such as exceptional use authorization and monitoring of patient needs. In 2024, 72% of disruptions were effective, while 28% did not occur due to the measures taken. Nuno Sim\u00f5es, director of the Infarmed's Unit for Interinstitutional Projects and for the Health System, stated that disruptions are not unique to Portugal, but occur throughout Europe, and that there are European working groups to analyze the issue and harmonize measures to ensure greater availability of medicines at the national level and protect patients' rights. However, in more than half of the cases, this deadline was not met. The report also highlights the main causes of disruptions, including delays in manufacturing or non-compliance with contractual conditions (57.44%), increased demand (21.17%), and logistical problems (6.01%). The Infarmed is monitoring cases of prolonged shortages of certain medications, including antidiabetics, medications for hyperactivity and attention deficit, and medications for treating pancreatic insufficiency and Helicobacter pylori infections. The Infarmed expects the shortage of antidiabetics, particularly semaglutide, dulaglutide, and liraglutide, to continue throughout 2025 due to increased demand for weight loss.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 08:42 AM\nSource:[sapo.pt](https://www.sapo.pt/noticias/atualidade/mais-de-metade-das-farmacias-reportaram_67a5c792e2651854e3074ffe)\n\n**Inside the Compounding Boom**\nHims & Hers, an online telehealth prescription company, has purchased a 30-second ad spot during Super Bowl LIX to promote its new 'Sick of the System' commercial and its compounded GLP-1 weight-loss injections, which cost $199 per month, a fifth of the out-of-pocket cost of brand-name options. Compounded pharmacies manufacture customized medications, governed by Section 503 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but are not evaluated by the FDA for safety, efficacy, or quality. The FDA has raised concerns about the practices of some compounders, including replacing semaglutide with less costly, untested, and unproven salt derivatives, and warned consumers about the risk of dosing errors when using comp drugs with little to no doctor oversight. The FDA has received multiple reports of adverse events, some requiring hospitalization, due to dosing errors. The shadow prescription drug market arose from a regulatory carveout intended to address drug shortages for patients with special needs, but has become a household name.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[americanactionforum.org](https://www.americanactionforum.org/weekly-checkup/inside-the-compounding-boom/)\n\n**The GLP-1 Saga Continues: FDA Ends the Tirzepatide Shortage: Frequently Asked Questions**\nThe FDA has removed tirzepatide from its list of shortage drugs, ending a regulatory back-and-forth that began in October 2024.

FDA will abstain from taking action against compound pharmacies and outsourcing facilities that discontinue making and distributing compounded tirzepatide by February 18, 2025, or March 19, 2025, respectively. However, Lilly can still sue these companies under the Lanham Act for violating its tirzepatide patent. Patients who have been prescribed compounded tirzepatide should be advised of the impending discontinuation to ensure a smooth transition. Other GLP-1 drugs, such as semaglutide, dulaglutide, and liraglutide, remain on the shortage list, and compounding pharmacies and outsourcing facilities can still make and dispense compounded copies of these drugs.

'As a responsible supplier and always concerned with the health and safety of its patients, Novo Nordisk communicates that there will be intermittent availability of Ozempic (semaglutide 1mg) throughout the first half of 2025, due to demand higher than expected', the company stated in a note to Bloomberg L\u00ednea. The shortage is not due to quality or regulatory issues with the product, but rather due to the complexity of the distribution chain. The company expects the stock to be restored gradually, but not immediately.

Her doctor will switch her to compounded semaglutide, but this is only a temporary fix. The FDA is expected to eventually end the shortage designation for semaglutide as well, and compounders will have to stop making it. The transition period will not be seamless, and many patients will be left without access to these life-changing medications. The bigger picture is that there's a lot of money on the line when it comes to GLP-1s, and the parties involved know it. Compounders have found a big revenue stream they don't want to easily give up, while Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have market exclusivity and want to make as much money as they can before it runs out.

In Greece, for example, the medication is being prescribed by doctors with non-related specialties, leading to concerns about its misuse. The Greek National Health Service has issued 28 fines and penalties totaling \u20ac50,000. Patients from Bulgaria, Serbia, Romania, Italy, and Turkey are also traveling to Greece to purchase Ozempic due to its lower price. Dr. Rayna Stoyanova, an endocrinologist, warns that Ozempic should not be used for weight loss outside of medical indication. In France, Ozempic is only prescribed for type 2 diabetes, and its distribution has been suspended in some cases. The Czech Republic has also restricted its use to diabetic patients and prohibited its export. However, the measures have been criticized, and the medication has become available again in 2024. In Spain, the General Council of Pharmacists has stated that they have no knowledge of citizens traveling to neighboring countries to purchase the medication. They also emphasize that the availability of the medication is not guaranteed, even with a Spanish prescription.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 04:04 AM\nSource:[Alimente](https://www.alimente.elconfidencial.com/bienestar/2024-12-30/ozempic-turismo-farmacias-medicamento_4031642/)\n\n**Diabetics face medicine shortage as slimming craze thins supply of Ozempic**\nA global craze for Ozempic as a weight-loss solution has led to a shortage in Malaysia, with pharmacies experiencing a surge in demand for the diabetes medication. According to Amrahi Buang, president of the Malaysian Pharmacists Society, the shortage is due to increased demand from non-diabetic individuals for its weight loss effects. Amrahi warned against using drugs for unapproved purposes without medical supervision, emphasizing that potential side effects of Ozempic include hypoglycemia or low blood sugar, which could be life-threatening. Dr. Wong Teck Wee, a consultant interventional cardiologist, highlighted the immediate side effects of Ozempic, citing a 2021 New England Journal of Medicine study, which found that between 44% and 47% of participants taking semaglutide for weight loss experienced nausea, while 30% to 35% reported having diarrhoea. Dr. Wong also noted anecdotal reports of psychological effects such as mood changes, anxiety and stress. He emphasized that rare but serious side effects, such as acute pancreatitis, have also been reported, although causality has not been definitively established. Dr. Lim Chong Wei, an endocrinology, diabetes and internal medicine specialist, clarified that semaglutide was originally approved as a weekly injection for Type 2 diabetes, typically combined with the right diet and exercise. He emphasized that semaglutide should be used alongside lifestyle and dietary changes, where these modifications alone often lead to minimal weight loss.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 29, 2024 11:09 PM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2024/12/30/diabetics-face-medicine-shortage-as-slimming-craze-thins-supply-of-ozempic)\n\n",
