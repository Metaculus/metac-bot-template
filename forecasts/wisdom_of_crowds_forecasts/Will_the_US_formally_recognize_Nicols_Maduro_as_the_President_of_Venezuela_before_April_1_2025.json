The plan includes modernizing the economy, achieving full independence, promoting peace and security, and protecting the environment. The AN also approved the Organic Law of the Youth Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Ribas, which aims to support young people who study and start businesses, and to promote more rights and responsibilities, such as the proper use of social media. However, the law has been met with criticism, with some lawmakers calling for a national consultation before its second discussion. The AN also approved the report presented by the National Electoral Council (CNE) on the estimated population as of April 30, 2025, which is necessary for reformulating the number of electoral districts and candidates for the upcoming elections. The report did not include the number of inhabitants calculated by the National Institute of Statistics (INE), which has raised concerns among lawmakers.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 08:28 PM\nSource:[efectococuyo.com](https://efectococuyo.com/politica/an-2020-ley-organica-plan-gobierno-maduro-fusion-popular-militar-policial/)\n\n**President Maduro: Goal is to Reach 2 Million Young People in El Sistema by 2027**\nVenezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro announced that the goal is to reach 2 million young people in El Sistema by 2027.

The reform would be the second attempt by the chavismo to modify the constitution since 2007, when Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's proposal was rejected by voters. The new reform aims to 'amplify democracy', 'define the profile of the society we want', and 'lay the foundations for a new, self-sustaining economy'. However, critics, including the ONG Acceso a la Justicia, fear that the real goal is to 'liquidate the rule of law' and centralize power in the executive branch. The reform process has been criticized for lacking transparency, as the project has not been published and the authorities have not disclosed what changes they plan to make. The first proposal is expected to be presented on February 15, 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 09:26 PM\nSource:[elnacional.com](https://www.elnacional.com/venezuela/las-9-claves-de-la-reforma-constitucional-que-propondra-maduro-en-venezuela/)\n\n**Apocryphal Message from Nicol\u00e1s Maduro Sparks Debate on Rafael Correa's Visit**\nA message attributed to Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on his X account has been widely shared on social media, claiming that he received a visit from former Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa to discuss the results of the first round of Ecuador's presidential elections.

I'm happy to see Luisa Gonz\u00e1lez's performance in this first round. Long live Ch\u00e1vez. Long live Bolivar.'

Rodr\u00edguez said, 'The president said, 'We will not accept them being brought in military planes or our migrants being brought in handcuffs and chains, because they are Venezuelans and have their rights preserved by the Constitution, and it is my duty as president to protect and preserve those human rights.' Rodr\u00edguez added that Maduro offered the use of state-owned Conviasa planes to ensure the safe transfer of 190 Venezuelan migrants from US territory. Rodr\u00edguez also called on the US to demonstrate its commitment to combating organized crime by deporting extremist opposition leaders who, according to Maduro, lead a human trafficking network. Rodr\u00edguez said, 'If they really want to combat organized crime, bring us the leaders of the 'coyotes' (human traffickers).

Amidst a severe political crisis, the opposition accuses Maduro of electoral fraud, pointing to Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the actual winner. While countries like Russia and China support Maduro, the United States and Argentina recognize Gonz\u00e1lez as the legitimate president. Ahead of the event, borders with Colombia have been closed and flights suspended, citing conspiracy prevention. The brief detention of opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado during a protest has heightened tensions. With a strong security presence in Caracas, the country faces a pivotal day in its political history.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 01:26 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/mundo/venezuela/2025/01/10/toma-de-posesion-del-presidente-de-venezuela-en-vivo-nicolas-maduro-edmundo-gonzales-protestas-y-mas-de-la-juramentacion-hoy-en-la-asamblea-nacional-maria-corina-machado-lrtmv-665950)\n\n**US Does Not Recognize Maduro as President of Venezuela**\nThe United States announced on Friday that it does not recognize Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the president of Venezuela and called for Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, whom it considers the winner of the elections, to be sworn in as the new president.

According to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Maduro 'celebrated an illegitimate presidential inauguration ceremony in Venezuela in a desperate attempt to take power'. Blinken stated that Maduro 'clearly lost the 2024 presidential elections and has no right to claim the presidency'. The US 'does not recognize Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the president of Venezuela' and rejects the 'fraudulent announcement' by the National Electoral Council (CNE) that the Chavista leader won the July 28 elections. 'The elected president, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia, must be sworn in and begin the democratic transition. We are willing to support the return to democracy in Venezuela,' Blinken said. The CNE, controlled by Chavismo, proclaimed Maduro's victory in the July 28 presidential elections, and he was sworn in today in Parliament despite opposition claims of having the acts with the results that would give a crushing victory to Gonz\u00e1lez Urrutia. The Biden administration, which will be succeeded by Donald Trump on January 20, increased the reward for information leading to the capture of Maduro to $25 million, accusing him of narcotics trafficking. It also offers $25 million for information leading to the capture of Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and $15 million for the arrest of Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino. According to Blinken, the US has banned entry to the country for nearly 2,000 people affiliated with Maduro and has imposed economic sanctions on 187 people linked to the Chavista leader. Meanwhile, the Biden government announced on Friday the extension for 18 months of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, a migratory relief for Venezuelans in the country, due to the 'grave humanitarian emergency' suffered by Venezuela. 'The United States reaffirms its support for the peaceful democratic aspirations of the Venezuelan people. The voices of Venezuelans must be heard and their votes respected,' Blinken insisted.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 04:49 AM\nSource:[lapatilla.com](https://www.lapatilla.com/2025/01/10/eeuu-no-reconoce-a-nicolas-maduro-como-presidente-y-pidio-que-edmundo-gonzalez-sea-juramentado/)\n\n",

The base rate for a sudden reversal in U.S. policy on such positions, particularly in relation to a specific administration's declared stance, is low. In previous situations where the U.S. has taken a firm stance against recognizing a particular government or leader, changes have generally been gradual and contingent on significant diplomatic developments, such as changes in governance, election monitoring, or changes in bilateral relations.
