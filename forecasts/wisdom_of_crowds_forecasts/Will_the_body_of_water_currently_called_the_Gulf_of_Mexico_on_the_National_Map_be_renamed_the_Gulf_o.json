The Associated Press has decided to refer to the mountain Denali as Mount McKinley, but will continue to use the original name 'Gulf of Mexico' while acknowledging the new name. Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has jokingly suggested renaming North America to 'Am\u00e9rica Mexicana' or 'Mexican America' in response to Trump's decision. Google Maps has agreed to change the name in its software, but Mexico has sent a letter of complaint to Google, stating that countries should not change the names of international bodies of water, but rather international organizations should do so. 'The Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years,' said the AP statement. 'The Associated Press will refer to it by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 02:47 PM\nSource:[CNET](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/gulf-of-america-name-may-not-last-past-trumps-presidency-expert/)\n\n**US President Trump Renames Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America'**\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America'. The move aims to reverse a centuries-old tradition and has already sparked international reactions. Trump wants to rename the Gulf because he believes it is a vital part of the US economy, connecting five southern US states to Mexico and the Caribbean, and accounting for 14% of US oil production. However, the main driver behind Trump's decision seems to be a nationalist sentiment. The executive order is titled 'Restoring Names that Reflect America's Greatness with Pride'. Trump has also ordered the renaming of Mount McKinley, the highest peak in the US, to its original name, Mount Denali, which was changed in 2015 during the presidency of Barack Obama. The US Geological Survey has announced that it will start using the new name, but it is unclear if other countries will follow suit. Google has also announced that it will start using the new name in its maps for US users, but will continue to use the original name for users in Mexico. The US Interior Department has been tasked with implementing the change, including updating the Geographic Names Information System, a database that includes official names of geographic features in the US. The US Board on Geographic Names has been instructed to provide guidance to ensure that all federal agencies start using the new name in their maps, contracts, and official documents. The Mexican government has no official way to object to the change, as the US has the right to name its own geographic features. However, the Mexican president has criticized Google's decision and called on the company to reconsider. She has also joked that if the Gulf is renamed, the world should consider using the original name for the southwestern US.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 02:38 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2025/02/08/article_2756781.html)\n\n**Illinois Gov.

He also mentioned plans to annex Green Bay, a move that could gain Illinois the third-oldest NFL franchise, the Packers. Pritzker's video also referenced Trump's alleged interest in acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names has the power to rename geographic places within the United States, but changes are discouraged unless there is a compelling reason.

This is part of a long pattern of anti-Mexican racism in the US, ranging from political scapegoating and border militarization to violent rhetoric that fuels hate crimes. The move also fits into a larger US strategy of controlling the Western Hemisphere, which dates back to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico could have devastating consequences, including the assertion of US territorial and economic claims over the region's rich natural resources. Companies like Google Maps, which has announced plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico, are playing into the billionaire-fueled power grab that advances a racist, nationalist agenda of domination and imperialism.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[commondreams.org](https://www.commondreams.org/opinion/trump-gulf-of-mexico)\n\n**EPA Renames Its Gulf Division to Honor the Gulf of America**\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has renamed its Gulf of Mexico Division to the Gulf of America Division (GAD) in accordance with President Trump's Executive Order.

This is part of a larger U.S. strategy of controlling the Western Hemisphere, dating back to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. The renaming is also a territorial and economic claim over the waters and their resources, further cementing U.S. imperial ambitions in the region. Companies like Google Maps, which has announced plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico, are playing into the billionaire-fueled power grab that advances a racist, nationalist agenda of domination and imperialism. The Gulf of Mexico is a shared resource of immense ecological, economic, and cultural significance for Mexico, the United States, and the world, and its renaming could have devastating consequences, including a disregard for historical truth, aggressive assertion of U.S. superiority, and continuation of exploitative colonialist practices that harm both the environment and Latin American people.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 12:35 AM\nSource:[pressenza.com](https://www.pressenza.com/2025/02/renaming-the-gulf-of-mexico-isnt-a-laughing-matter-but-part-of-a-u-s-imperialist-power-grab/)\n\n**Mexican President Protests Google Maps Change to 'Gulf of America'**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has sent a letter to Google protesting the change of 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' on Google Maps. The change was announced by Google on January 28, 2025, following a presidential order by Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. According to Sheinbaum, the name change is not legally possible as the Gulf of Mexico is defined by the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea as a body of water within the territorial waters of Mexico. Sheinbaum also proposed renaming the United States to 'Mexican America' and suggested that Google display maps with this name when users search for 'Mexican America'.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 03:39 AM\nSource:[GIGAZINE](https://gigazine.net/news/20250131-gulf-of-mexico-america/)\n\n**Google Maps and Apple Maps to Change 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America'**\nGoogle Maps will change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to 'Gulf of America' in the future, following the official renaming by the US government. Apple Maps has already started displaying the new name, but only when specifically searched for. The change will be applied globally, but with some exceptions. In Google Maps, US users will only see the new name, while users outside the US will see both the old and new names. Mexican users will still see the old name. Apple Maps currently displays the old name, but shows the new name when searched for. It is assumed that Apple will follow Google's approach and update the name once the change is made in the US government's database. The renaming was made official by a decree signed by former US President Trump on January 20, 2025, which also renamed the Mount McKinley in Alaska to Denali. According to the US government, the renaming aims to 'restore names that praise America's greatness'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[curved.de](https://curved.de/news/golf-von-amerika-google-maps-und-apple-maps-ziehen-mit-770002)\n\n**Sheinbaum to Send Letter to Google Over Renaming of Gulf of Mexico**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Wednesday that she will send a letter to Google after the company renamed the Gulf of Mexico as 'Gulf of America' in its maps in the United States, following an order from former US President Donald Trump. Sheinbaum argued that the decree has to do with Trump's continental platform, so the tech company should distinguish between US territory and international waters. Sheinbaum joked that she will also ask Google to call the US 'America Mexicana'. 'We are sending a letter to Google first to say: I suppose Google Maps knows about this international division, it also knows which organization is responsible for naming international seas and what would correspond to the continental platform,' Sheinbaum explained. The president questioned Google's decision, which explained on social media X that it renamed the Gulf in its US maps, citing that it is the current official name of that area in the US. Sheinbaum pointed out that Trump's order applies to the US continental platform in the Gulf, but not to the international body of water. 'The day after tomorrow, we will show you the letter we are sending today because it is very important to put everything in its proper context in publications. To change the name of an international sea, it is not a country that changes it, it is an international organization,' Sheinbaum stated. Sheinbaum insisted that for the rest of the world, it will continue to be called the Gulf of Mexico, citing a publication by The Telegraph that the UK will not recognize the new name assigned by Trump. 'It cannot be anything more than a country's definition, since a country has jurisdiction over its territory, not over the part that is international sea,' Sheinbaum noted. Sheinbaum recalled that in 17th-century maps, where the Gulf of Mexico was already mentioned, it was also called 'America Mexicana' to the current US and Canadian territory, so she joked that she will ask Google to make this change.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum joked that if Trump went ahead with the renaming, her country would rename North America 'Mexican America.' Despite Florida Governor Ron DeSantis putting the 'Gulf of America' on an official document, it is unclear how many others will follow Trump's lead.

Many countries have different names for the same body of water, such as the Persian Gulf, the South China Sea, and the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo. National Geographic, Google, and Apple have not yet changed their maps to reflect Trump's executive order, and it is unclear how many others will follow suit. 'It is, I suppose, an internationally recognized sea, but (to be honest), a situation like this has never come up before so I need to confirm the appropriate convention,' said Peter Bellerby, a cartographer at Bellerby & Co. Globemakers. 'If, for instance, he wanted to change the Atlantic Ocean to the American Ocean, we would probably just ignore it.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[milwaukeeindependent.com](https://www.milwaukeeindependent.com/newswire/politics-maps-cartographers-ponder-next-steps-trumps-abrupt-geographic-renaming-scheme/)\n\n**The Gulf of Whatnow? Mapmakers grapple with Trump's geographic renaming plans. - The Boston Globe**\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum joked that if Trump's plan to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America were to happen, her country would rename North America 'Mexican America.' However, she later clarified that the Gulf of Mexico will continue to be called by its original name. The renaming plan is part of Trump's executive order 'Restoring Names That Honor American Greatness.' Mapmakers are grappling with the issue, with some questioning the feasibility of changing the name of a widely recognized body of water. Peter Bellerby, a cartographer, said, 'If, for instance, he wanted to change the Atlantic Ocean to the American Ocean, we would probably just ignore it.' National Geographic stated that it does not comment on individual cases, but strives to be apolitical and consult multiple authoritative sources. The company also includes explanatory notes for place names in dispute, such as the Sea of Japan and the East Sea.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 07:42 AM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/23/nation/gulf-whatnow-mapmakers-grapple-with-trumps-geographic-renaming-plans/)\n\n",
