The second half of the year saw a 12% increase compared to the same period in 2023, reaching 1.5 million ounces. Polyus estimates that gold production in 2025 will be in the range of 2.5-2.6 million ounces, citing a possible decline due to the decrease in processing content at the Olympiad site, as the Eastern pit's fourth stage has been completed and the company is increasing the volume of stripping work on the fifth stage. Production is expected to remain at 2.5-2.6 million ounces until 2027, after which the gold content in the ore at the Eastern pit is expected to increase again.

He emphasized that the gold belongs to the American public and that transparency is crucial in verifying the reserves.

According to the US Mint, Fort Knox holds over half of the US Treasury's gold, approximately 4,852 tons (or 147,300,000 troy ounces), valued at around 62 trillion KRW (approximately 620 trillion KRW) at current prices. Due to security concerns, Fort Knox is closed to outsiders, and the last time it was opened to the press was in 1974. This has led to ongoing conspiracy theories about the existence of gold at Fort Knox. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, recently hinted at investigating the matter on social media, saying 'Fort Knox may or may not have gold.' Donald Trump also announced that he would visit Fort Knox with Musk, sparking speculation about a possible audit. In contrast, the South Korean government does not store gold domestically. The Bank of Korea's 104.4 tons (or 8,380 gold bars) of gold are stored at the Bank of England. The Bank of Korea has stored gold abroad due to transportation costs and transaction convenience, but with the recent increase in global gold demand, there is a possibility that the Bank of England's gold liquidity may become a problem, raising questions about whether it is still acceptable to store gold abroad.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 07:25 AM\nSource:[YTN](https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0134_202503041554323475)\n\n**Countries with the Largest Gold Reserves**\nThe World Gold Council (WGC) has updated its ranking of countries by gold reserves.

Germany has the largest gold reserves in Europe, with around 3,350 tons. Belarus has a significant gold reserve of nearly 54 tons, surpassing those of countries like the Czech Republic, Kyrgyzstan, and Lithuania. The top 5 countries by gold reserves are: 1. USA - 8,130 tons 2. Germany - 3,350 tons 3. Italy - 2,450 tons 4. France - 2,440 tons 5.

This has led to a surge in global central banks' demand for gold, with the World Gold Council reporting that the total demand for physical gold in 2024 reached 4974 tons, a new record high. The US Federal Reserve has continued to dominate the gold market, purchasing over 1000 tons of gold in 2024, accounting for 20% of the total demand last year. The market is speculating about the implications of this gold rush, including the potential for a shift in the global economic landscape. The three main drivers of this phenomenon are tariffs, arbitrage opportunities, and risk aversion. The US government's trade policy uncertainty under President Trump has triggered a 'pre-emptive hoarding' of gold, with traders seeking to avoid potential tariffs by moving gold to the US before the policy takes effect. The Swiss customs data shows that the export of gold to the US in January 2025 reached a 13-year high, while Singapore and the UK also saw significant increases in gold exports. The price difference between futures and spot gold has widened to a record high of $35 per ounce, creating an arbitrage opportunity for traders to buy gold in London and resell it in the US. The main driver of this phenomenon, however, is the risk aversion driven by the geopolitical tensions and the US dollar's credit crisis. The US Federal Reserve's decision to audit the gold reserves at Fort Knox has sparked concerns about the transparency of the US gold management, with some speculating that the audit may reveal discrepancies in the gold reserves. If the audit confirms the suspicions, it could lead to a devastating blow to the US dollar's creditworthiness and a surge in gold prices. The future of gold prices is uncertain, but some analysts predict that it may follow a 'short-term surge, mid-term volatility, and long-term differentiation' pattern. The US government's potential imposition of tariffs on gold imports could push gold prices above $3000 per ounce in the second quarter of 2025. The US Federal Reserve's expected rate cut could also reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, attracting more institutional investors to the market. However, the market may experience a short-term correction if the US inflation data exceeds expectations, forcing the Federal Reserve to delay the rate cut. The long-term trend of gold prices will depend on the shift towards a multi-polar pricing system, with emerging markets seeking to establish a gold-backed trade settlement system to challenge the US dollar's dominance. The potential for a 'dual-track' gold market, with Western markets dominated by futures and Eastern markets driven by physical demand, could lead to a significant increase in gold prices in the long term.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 01:17 AM\nSource:[app.myzaker.com](http://app.myzaker.com/news/article.php?pk=67c650f38e9f0954c957a1fb)\n\n**Tunkillia JORC Resources Grow to 1.6Moz gold, 3.1Moz silver**\nBarton Gold Holdings Limited has announced a Mineral Resources update for its South Australian Tunkillia Gold Project.

The coins were then stored in Fort Knox, Kentucky, where they remain to this day. The coins are extremely rare and valuable, with their space travel and connection to a historic figure making them even more unique. The designer of the coin, Thomas D. Rogers Sr., has spoken about the controversy surrounding the number of feathers on the coin's design, which has sparked debate among collectors. The coins are now considered priceless and are unlikely to be sold, making them a piece of living history that symbolizes exploration, remembrance, and the value of small things that can have a significant impact.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 08:16 PM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/respuestas/us/solo-quedan-12-monedas-de-este-tipo-son-tan-raras-que-ni-siquiera-estan-a-la-venta-estados-unidos-nnda-nnlt-noticia/)\n\n**Gold & Silver Are Flooding Into US Warehouses**\nGold and silver are pouring into US warehouses at a rate not seen since the pandemic, sparking speculation that the US may be preparing to revalue its gold reserves.

Bloomberg macro strategist Simon White notes that 'You're never far away from conspiracy in the gold market,' but suggests that one should keep an open mind to stay solvent. With Donald Trump in charge, the theory that the US may be revaluing its gold reserves cannot be completely discounted.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 05:37 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/precious-metals/gold-silver-are-flooding-us-warehouses)\n\n**Arthur Hayes Calls Trump's Cryptocurrency Reserve Fund Plan 'Empty Words'**\nArthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, called Donald Trump's statement about creating a cryptocurrency reserve fund 'empty words'. Trump announced on March 2 that he instructed his team to 'move forward' with establishing a state fund for digital assets, which would include the following cryptocurrencies: 'Nothing new. Empty words. Let me know when Congress approves a loan or revalues the gold stored at Fort Knox to a higher value. Without that, they won't have the money to buy bitcoins and shibcoins,' Hayes wrote. According to the US Treasury, the federal budget deficit in the 2024 fiscal year, which ended on September 30, 2024, was $1.83 trillion, $138 billion more than in the previous reporting period. Hayes is not exaggerating when he says that the US government lacks funds to buy cryptocurrencies. However, one commentator suggested that the fund for digital assets could be created without Congressional approval, and initially, it would be funded with seized cryptocurrencies. Currently, the government holds $18.4 billion in bitcoins and $136.9 million in ethers, which could serve as the foundation for the reserve fund that Trump is advocating for.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 08:05 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/article-2675840)\n\n**Elon Musk and Donald Trump to Visit Fort Knox to Verify Gold Reserves**\nFort Knox, a US military base in Kentucky, has been the subject of interest for Elon Musk and Donald Trump, who plan to visit the site with a camera to verify the presence of the 147 million ounces of gold stored there. The gold reserves, which have been stored at Fort Knox since 1937, are audited annually by the US Treasury, and the Mint of the United States has confirmed that the gold is present and accounted for. However, some have questioned the accuracy of the audits, leading to a legend that the gold has been stolen or spent. The visit by Musk and Trump is expected to provide clarity on the matter, as they will be live-streaming their entry into the base with a camera. According to the US Mint, the current gold reserves at Fort Knox amount to 147.3 million ounces, which is a significant decrease from the 649.6 million ounces stored in 1941.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 05:24 PM\nSource:[COPE | Noticias y radio online](https://www.cope.es/programas/la-linterna/audios/paso-fort-knox-147-millones-onzas-oro-estados-unidos-hay-teoria-elon-musk-ira-comprobarlo-20250225_3102593.html)\n\n**Donald Trump and Elon Musk to Inspect Fort Knox Gold Reserves**\nDonald Trump and Elon Musk have expressed their desire to verify the integrity of the US gold reserves, including those stored at the highly secure Fort Knox site. They have rekindled an old conspiracy theory. According to CBS News, Elon Musk will soon visit Fort Knox to ensure that the gold is still present, as announced by Donald Trump. 'We will open the doors. We will inspect Fort Knox,' Trump said on February 20. 'I don't want to open it and find out the shelves are empty,' he added. The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has assured that the gold reserves are intact, stating that an annual audit is conducted and all the gold is present and accounted for. The US Mint reports that the gold reserves currently stored at Fort Knox amount to 147.3 million ounces, worth over $400 billion at current prices. This represents approximately half of the US gold reserves. Only small quantities have been removed for testing the gold's purity during regular audits. No gold has been transferred in or out of the vault for many years, according to the institution. The last visit to the Kentucky site for non-authorized individuals was in 2017, when the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, the Governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin, and Congressional representatives visited the vaults. They were opened for the first time to civilians in 1974 to silence rumors that the gold had been removed from the vaults.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 25, 2025 12:14 PM\nSource:[BFMTV](https://www.bfmtv.com/economie/international/fort-knox-quelle-est-cette-reserve-d-or-que-donald-trump-veut-faire-verifier_AN-202502250439.html)\n\n**Trump Says He's Going With Musk to Check If There Is Gold in Fort Knox**\nPresident Donald Trump announced that he and Elon Musk will visit Fort Knox to verify the presence of gold reserves.

Many experts noted the historical consistency of this reported figure and the lack of significant factors that would prompt a change. Despite public interest and scrutiny driven by figures like Elon Musk and Donald Trump, the experts largely agreed that such external pressures are unlikely to impact the official reporting. The revised probabilities after considering recent news articles and updates generally remained stable or decreased slightly, with most experts maintaining their high initial probabilities, typically ranging from 80% to 100%.",
