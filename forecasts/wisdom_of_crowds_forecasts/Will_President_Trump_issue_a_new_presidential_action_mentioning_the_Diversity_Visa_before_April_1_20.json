The visa, priced at $5 million, will be available to wealthy, job-creating individuals who will pay taxes and contribute to the economy. Trump stated that the gold card is 'better and more sophisticated' than the existing green card and will bring in 'brilliant, hardworking, job-creating people.' The visa will replace the 35-year-old EB-5 investor visa programme and offer a pathway to US citizenship. Trump said, 'Our country will be woke no longer,' and emphasized that the goal is to balance the federal budget, something that hasn't been done in 24 years. The administration has not yet detailed the timeline for the visa's launch, but Trump indicated it would be available 'very, very soon.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 05:22 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/finance/personal-finance/gold-card-will-be-better-than-green-card-trump-on-new-visa-scheme-125030500308_1.html)\n\n**Brazilian Immigrants Seek European Citizenship Amid Trump's Immigration Crackdown**\nFollowing Donald Trump's return to the presidency in 2024, his government implemented stricter immigration policies, including the introduction of a 'golden visa' that grants American citizenship to foreign investors who invest at least US$ 5 million in a project in the country. As a result, many immigrants are seeking European citizenship as a 'Plan B' to avoid deportation and ensure a safer future. Companies specializing in obtaining Spanish and Italian citizenship have seen a significant increase in demand in the first months of 2025. According to immigration expert Wilson Bicalho, 'being a European citizen has the advantage of a more accessible tourist visa, but if the person has a history of irregular immigration or has been deported, this can contaminate the new European passport.' Bicalho also notes that the European passport facilitates the obtaining of certain types of visas, especially for entrepreneurs. 'While a Brazilian needs a very high investment for an entrepreneurial visa, a European citizen has more facilities in this process,' he says. The fear among Brazilians living illegally in the US has increased with the expansion of the Expedited Removal mechanism, which allows for the summary deportation of undocumented immigrants in just one day. 'The fear is real,' says Wilson. 'The way President Donald Trump impacts immigration is by inhibiting new immigrants from coming to the US, with images. So, the scenes of immigrants being deported, chained, the harsher speech of Trump on the issue of immigration, impacts not only the immigrants in the US, but also those who think of coming irregularly,' he adds.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 05:17 AM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/mundo/temendo-deportacao-por-trump-brasileiros-buscam-cidadania-europeia)\n\n**Trump vows to end 'woke' culture in US, promises radical reforms**\nUS President Donald Trump stated in a speech to the US Congress that he has ended the 'tyranny' of diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government. Trump said, 'Our country will not be more woke.' He emphasized that the 'American dream is unstoppable,' after six weeks of tension with neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico. Trump's close advisor, Elon Musk, was present at the speech, which was delivered during peak viewing hours. Trump praised his administration's accomplishments in the past six weeks and promised to continue his efforts to radically reform the US government and end the war in Ukraine, no matter the cost. He said, 'We have achieved more in 43 days than most administrations achieve in four or eight years, and we are just getting started.' Trump also announced plans to request funds to implement his policy of deporting irregular migrants. The White House considers these migrants to be criminals for entering the country without a visa, and Trump has ordered raids and deportations, including at the US military base in Guantanamo, Cuba.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 04:48 AM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/mundo/estados-unidos/trump-lanza-advertencia-congreso-ee-uu-nuestro-pais-no-sera-woke-PP4356746)\n\n**Trump on gold cards: We'll allow most successful, job-creating people to buy a path to US citizenship**\nUS President Donald Trump announced the introduction of a 'gold card' visa, which will allow successful job-creating individuals from around the world to buy a path to US citizenship for $5 million. Trump stated, 'We have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very soon. For $5 million dollars, we will allow the most successful, job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship.' The gold card will replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa programme, which grants 'green cards' to foreigners investing in US businesses. In 2024, the State Department issued over 12,000 EB-5 visas, a record high.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 04:04 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/world/trump-on-gold-cards-we-ll-allow-most-successful-job-creating-people-from-all-over-the-world-to-buy-a-path-to-us-citizenship-article-12956597.html)\n\n**Trump and his 'broligarchs' make masculinity 'grate' again**\nUS President Donald Trump has banned diversity and inclusion programs across the US, citing 'merit and lethality' as the new criteria for appointments. This move has been followed by Fortune 500 companies, including Goldman Sachs and Pepsi, which have deleted their diversity targets. The article suggests that this shift is a display of 'masculine energy' and a reaction against what some men see as 'reverse discrimination'. The author argues that this sentiment is real, but also misinformed, as the pay gap between men and women in Australia is still around 21%. The article also explores the idea that men's perceptions of workplace inequality are influenced by their own life experiences and identities, and that this can lead to confusion and damage. The author concludes that the best way to address this issue is to have a diverse range of views in the room.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 06:38 PM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-05/trump-oligarchs-masculinity/105009952)\n\n**The \"Gold Card\": Analyzing the Latest Immigration Innovation**\nPresident Trump proposed a new type of U.S. visa, the 'Gold Card', which could be issued to companies or individuals for $5 million per card. The administration suggests that this new status will replace the existing EB-5 investor visa program. If implemented, the U.S. will join several other countries with 'Golden Visa' programs, including Portugal, the UAE, Dominica, and Thailand. The U.S. program differs as it is designed to pay off the U.S. debt rather than create jobs through investment. The proposal also includes a significant tax benefit, exempting Gold Card holders from U.S. taxation on their worldwide income, only taxing them on their U.S. income. It is unclear if this benefit will continue if they choose to become U.S. citizens or is only available to those who remain in Gold Card status.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 03:39 PM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/gold-card-analyzing-latest-immigration-innovation)\n\n**Donald Trump's Team Takes First Steps To Cut Legal Immigration**\nDonald Trump's team has taken steps to reduce legal immigration in the United States. During his first term, Trump reduced the number of legal immigrants admitted to the country, with approximately 770,000 fewer individuals immigrating legally between FY 2016 and FY 2020. The Trump administration also blocked the entry of hundreds of thousands of refugees and implemented policies that narrowed the grounds for waiving visa interviews, leading to increased visa wait times. Additionally, Trump officials plan to end parole for several hundred thousand individuals sponsored for humanitarian parole and terminate Temporary Protected Status for Haitians, Venezuelans, and others. The Trump administration's public charge rule, which was eliminated by the Biden administration, could be reintroduced, potentially lowering legal immigration levels by raising income and resource requirements for immigrants. Trump officials are also considering a new 'Muslim ban' and efforts to block the entry of Diversity Visa and family-sponsored immigrants through regulation or presidential proclamation. 'We are starting to see signs of the impact of the president's 'extreme vetting' policy,' said Dan Berger of Green & Spiegel. 'Officers are increasingly comparing what the individual says and has on electronic devices to other agency records and what's on the internet. That is fair, but recently we have seen minor inconsistencies lead to denied entry.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2025/03/04/donald-trumps-team-takes-first-steps-to-cut-legal-immigration/)\n\n**Share your thoughts on this story: What Trump could implement next from Project 2025**\nPresident Trump has implemented several executive orders aligned with Project 2025, a conservative blueprint from the Heritage Foundation. The initiative aims to gut the federal workforce, roll back diversity and LGBTQ programs, and increase immigration enforcement. Despite initially claiming ignorance of the plan, Trump has appointed key figures linked to Project 2025, including Russell Vought, Tom Homan, and Brendan Carr, to important government roles. Trump has already signed orders to ban transgender service members, deploy troops to the southern border, and eliminate diversity programs. However, Project 2025 is a comprehensive 920-page plan, and Trump could still adopt many of its proposals, including further immigration enforcement and potential rollbacks of environmental regulations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 04:27 PM\nSource:[The Boston Globe](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/03/nation/share-your-thoughts-this-story-what-trump-could-implement-next-project-2025/)\n\n**Trump's New Attempt to Eliminate the Diversity Visa Program**\nA new proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, aims to eliminate the Diversity Visa Program, also known as the lottery visa program, which grants up to 55,000 permits per year to certain applicants. The program, which has been in place for years, has been criticized for being unnecessary and for prioritizing diversity over security. According to Rep. Mike Collins, the program is 'a pointless exercise in virtue signaling by the government.' Collins argues that the program is 'a chain migration system' that allows a computer algorithm to determine the path to citizenship for 50,000 immigrants. He also claims that the program is 'a broken system' that needs to be reformed. The proposal has been met with support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and restricts opportunities for qualified workers. 'We should be awarding visas to the best and brightest immigrants from around the world who share our commitment to American values,' said Ryan Walker, vice president of Heritage Action. 'Issuing visas based on arbitrary 'diversity' quotas undermines national security, restricts opportunities for qualified workers, and doesn't promote true diversity,' he added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 22, 2025 12:53 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/visas-y-tramites/adios-a-la-loteria-de-visas-el-nuevo-intento-de-trump-para-eliminarla-nid22022025/)\n\n**Update on Legal Challenges to President Trump's Presidential Actions**\nSince President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, he has issued a record number of presidential actions, including 62 executive orders and various declarations. Several of these actions have been challenged in court, including orders to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates and programs. The Office of Management and Budget ('OMB') also issued a memorandum freezing federal grants and loans. Additionally, an order aimed to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants and those temporarily present in the U.S. Furthermore, an order, referred to as 'Fork in the Road,' offered financial incentives to encourage federal employees to resign, with the goal of downsizing the federal workforce. AGG will continue to monitor developments related to President Trump's presidential actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/update-on-legal-challenges-to-president-5049448/)\n\n**Loter\u00eda de visas: \u00bfotra puerta que cierra a los cubanos?**\nA new initiative led by Republican congressman Mike Collins threatens to eliminate the Diversity Visa Program for Immigrants (DV) in the United States, also known as the 'visa lottery'. This program, which allows over 50,000 immigrants to obtain permanent residence each year, could be canceled if Collins' proposal, part of the SAFE Act, is successful. Collins argues that the measure aims to 'stop chain migration by eliminating the possibility of winners of the Visa Lottery sponsoring family members to obtain green cards'. Collins stated, 'We have opened our country to an almost endless chain migration system while launching a dart at the world and leaving a faceless computer code to determine the path to citizenship for 50,000 immigrants'. The Republican initiative rekindles an old debate about the continuation of the program, which has been criticized in the past. In 2017, Donald Trump asked Congress to eliminate it, saying 'It sounds good but it's not good, it's not good. It hasn't been good and we've been against it'. Opponents of the visa lottery consider it unfair to grant privileges to immigrants without a merit-based selection process. Collins emphasized, 'Ending the Visa Lottery is common sense'. Ryan Walker, executive vice president of Heritage Action, argued that 'arbitrary diversity quotas' could restrict opportunities for qualified talents and pose a risk to national security. Roy Beck, founder of NumbersUSA, strongly criticized the program, calling it 'one of the most insulting government programs against American workers'. The argument of national security has been a key point in efforts to eliminate the program. In 2017, the terrorist attack in New York by Sayfullo Saipov, who had obtained his residence through the visa lottery in 2010, reignited the debate. The threat of canceling the program comes on top of the recent exclusion of Cuban citizens from the DV-2026 lottery, which had been open for registration until November 2024. Cuba, one of the countries historically most benefited by this type of visa, was left out of the list of eligible countries, which still includes Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 08:18 PM\nSource:[cubanet.org](https://www.cubanet.org/loteria-de-visas-otra-puerta-que-cierra-a-los-cubanos/)\n\n**Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program**\nPresident Donald Trump has the opportunity to cancel the Diversity Visa program, also known as the 'green card lottery', which has been criticized for undermining American interests. The program, established in 1990, randomly selects participants for a legal immigration pathway, with 55,000 immigrant visas granted annually. However, the program lacks a meritocratic foundation, is susceptible to criminal activity and fraud, and poses national security threats. Since its inception, the program has brought over 1.5 million immigrants to the US, but also indirectly facilitated the arrival of millions more. The program's selection process chooses individuals regardless of their education, skill, or economic needs, contradicting American values. The US consular corps allocates significant time and effort to verifying the authenticity of submitted documents, but many applicants come from countries where bribery and document forgery are common practices. The program has been associated with numerous criminal enterprises and has allowed potentially dangerous individuals to enter the country. President Trump has called for the program's termination, and with Republicans in control of Congress, he now has an historic opportunity to build a more rational immigration system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[theamericanconservative.com](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/)\n\n**US order on workforce diversity will hit Indians**\nUS President Donald Trump has issued an executive order to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in the US government and private sector. This move is seen as a reversal of affirmative action policies, which were introduced by President John F. Kennedy in 1961. Trump has accused his predecessor, Joe Biden, of 'DEI madness' and has urged private companies to 'end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences.' Several large companies, including Walmart, Target, and Amazon, have already rolled back their DEI programs. The move is expected to have global implications, particularly for Indians who are hired by these companies. Women and people of color in the US will also be affected by the new executive order, which is seen as a step backward in the fight for equality.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 09:19 PM\nSource:[tribuneindia.com](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/us-order-on-workforce-diversity-will-hit-indians/)\n\n**Trump's Plans to End the Green Card Lottery: What's Next?**\nUS President Donald Trump has announced plans to end the Diversity Visa Program, also known as the Green Card lottery. However, the official website of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not mention any information about the cancellation of the program. The USCIS has only announced that the COVID-19 vaccination requirement for Green Card applicants has been waived. The Diversity Visa Program allows 50,000 immigrants from underrepresented countries to enter the US each year through a random drawing. The program has not been officially canceled, and the USCIS has not announced any changes to the program. However, the Trump administration has introduced new rules for Green Card applicants, including a new form for I-485 applications. The new rules also affect the processing times for Green Cards based on employment. Experts warn that the new rules may impact the processing times for Green Cards and that employers and their employees should consider the possibility of repeated delays in their strategies for non-immigrant and immigrant visa applications. 'I am starting the process of terminating the Diversity Visa Program. I will ask Congress to immediately initiate work to eliminate this program,' Trump said in 2017. The program was criticized by Trump after a terrorist attack in New York in 2017, in which the perpetrator, Sayfullo Saipov, allegedly entered the US on a Green Card. Trump has also introduced new rules for immigration, including a ban on granting citizenship to people born in the US. The new rules have sparked controversy and protests across the country.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 08:02 AM\nSource:[kaktus.media](https://kaktus.media/doc/516985_chto_proishodit_s_polycheniem_green_card_s_prihodom_trampa_razbiraemsia.html)\n\n**US Suspends 'X' Gender Option on Passports Following Trump Decree**\nThe United States has suspended the issuance of passports with the 'X' gender option for non-binary individuals, following a decree signed by President Donald Trump on his first day in office. The decision reverses a policy implemented by the previous administration, which allowed for the option of 'X' on passports starting in April 2022. Trump's decree recognizes only two genders: male and female, and aims to 'restore biological truth' and prevent federal funds from being used to promote 'gender ideology', a term often used by conservatives to refer to LGBTQ+ issues. The decree also removes the 'X' option from official government documents, such as passports and visas, which will now reflect the sex assigned at birth. Trump had criticized the previous administration's policies on diversity, equity, and inclusion during his campaign, and promised to end what he called the 'transgender delirium' in the US. He also announced plans to suspend federal funding for hormone treatments for gender transition and suggested prohibiting trans women from participating in women's sports competitions, a measure already in place in many states. Additionally, Trump ordered that trans women be housed in men's prisons, a decision widely criticized by LGBTQ+ activists and human rights defenders, who point to the risk of sexual violence in prison units.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 10:17 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mundo/eua-suspendem-emissao-de-passaportes-com-genero-x-apos-decreto-de-trump/)\n\n**US Suspends Gender X Passport Option Following Trump Decree**\nThe United States has suspended the issuance of passports with the gender X option for individuals who identify as non-binary, citing a decree signed by President Donald Trump on his first day in office.

A series of diversity programs will be terminated. Trump stated in his inaugural address that the US would 'only have two genders, man and woman.' A corresponding decree, titled 'Protect Women from Gender Ideology and Restore Biological Truth at the Federal Government,' was signed by Trump shortly after. The decree targets trans women, with the majority of the text addressing them. However, all trans individuals will be affected by the new rules. According to the decree, a person's sexual identity will only be defined by the sex cells their body produces, i.e., egg cells and sperm cells. Federal agencies will only use the word 'sex' and not 'gender,' which also encompasses social aspects. Trump had previously made anti-trans rhetoric during his campaign. The consequences of this decree will include the abolition of the option for a third gender on passports and visas, which was introduced by the Biden administration in 2022. Government forms will only list two genders, and publications from federal agencies will also only use two genders. The Trump administration will also prohibit the use of tax funds for programs that support medical gender-affirming care. A series of diversity programs will be terminated, including those that address other forms of diversity. The new administration plans to hold monthly meetings with key agencies to evaluate which diversity programs still 'discriminate' against Americans, according to a representative of the Trump administration.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 09:02 AM\nSource:[Der Tagesspiegel](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/internationales/trumps-usa-wollen-nur-zwei-geschlechter-anerkennen-eines-des-ersten-dekrete-zielt-auf-trans-menschen-13055863.html)\n\n**Trump Signs Executive Orders to Limit DEI Policies and Recognize Only Two Genders**\nUS President Donald Trump signed two executive orders on January 20, 2025, one to abolish the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies promoted by the previous Biden administration and another to recognize only two genders, male and female, as official by the federal government. Trump stated in his inauguration speech, 'This week, I will end the government's policies that socially manipulate race and gender in every aspect of public and private life. We will build a society that is colorblind and merit-based.' The executive orders criticize the Biden administration's DEI efforts as 'unlawful and immoral discriminatory programs' and call for the elimination of all DEI programs in federal government employment procedures and training policies, as well as the termination of DEI positions within the government within 60 days. Trump also stated, 'From today, the official policy of the US government is that there are only two genders, male and female.' The executive order emphasizes the use of 'sex' (biological sex) instead of 'gender' (social and cultural sex) in government policies and requires that government-issued identification documents, such as passports and visas, be based on unchangeable biological sex.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 06:26 AM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20250121/k00/00m/030/176000c)\n\n**Trump Announces Agenda Against Gender Diversity on First Day as President**\nOn his first day as president, Donald Trump announced his agenda against gender diversity, stating that his administration will only recognize two genders: male and female. This move threatens to reverse progress made for the transgender and non-binary population, potentially blocking access to gender-affirming medical care and restricting their participation in sports. Human rights organizations warn that several of Trump's announcements on his inauguration day could erase years of progress in inclusion and diversity. Trump stated, 'From today, the government's policy in the United States is that there are only two genders: male and female.' He also promised to end 'the government's policy of trying to design race and gender in every aspect of public and private life.' This is a direct reference to what he has called the 'woke agenda,' which he promises to destroy. However, what concerns groups fighting for the rights of people with diverse gender identities is that Trump's words seem not to be empty statements, as the president has already announced plans to sign amendments to concretize them. Trump has also announced plans to sign an executive order that would restrict access to gender-affirming medical care and limit the participation of trans women in women's sports. Additionally, the order could lead to only two sexes being recognized in official documents such as passports and visas. This could have a profound impact on the progress made by the trans population in the country. The UN has stated that one of the human rights abuses against transgender people includes the 'lack of legal recognition of their gender identity.' Trump has also announced plans to issue other executive orders that would cut programs of diversity, equity, and inclusion 'very soon.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 01:45 AM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/es/ee-uu-y-canad%C3%A1/20250121-en-su-primer-d%C3%ADa-como-presidente-trump-afirma-su-agenda-contra-la-diversidad-de-g%C3%A9nero)\n\n**Trump Administration to Rescind Diversity Program and Recognize Only Two Genders**\nAccording to officials, the incoming Trump administration plans to rescind the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) program and issue a presidential order recognizing only two genders, male and female.

The actions, presented by a new administration official at the White House, are a sign of the cultural war issues that Trump's election campaign highlighted and which he promised to address as president. The first order requires agencies to treat biological men and women as separate sexes, to stop promoting 'gender ideology', and to require certain agencies to return to recognizing only 'male' and 'female' in their employment forms. For example, the official said that the State Department will now ask applicants for passports and visas to 'clearly' state their gender in official documents. The official said that federal prisons and migrant shelters will be required to protect 'single-sex areas'. The official added, 'What we are doing today is defining that recognizing two sexes, male and female, is US policy. These two sexes are not changeable, and they are based on a fundamental reality that is not open to debate.' The official said that among Trump's executive order instructions is a ban on using federal funds for sex change procedures, which would ensure that 'Americans have the right to free speech', which the official said could be restricted when 'people are asked to use their preferred pronouns.' The official continued, 'The federal government will no longer work to promote gender ideology.' The official pointed out that Trump plans to issue another executive order that would end 'diversity, equity, and inclusion programs', using an acronym for diversity, equity, and inclusion. The executive order would work to 'dismantle diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, including environmental justice programs, equal opportunity grants, the equity plan, and equality initiatives.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 04:21 PM\nSource:[CNN Arabic](https://arabic.cnn.com/world/article/2025/01/20/trump-to-sign-orders-banning-gender-ideology-dei-federal-government)\n\n**Trump Announces Significant Actions Before Taking Office**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump announced a series of significant actions before taking office.

Based on the frequency of immigration-related presidential actions and their focus on the Diversity Visa, a reasonable base rate for such an action in the context of a current presidency would be estimated at around 20%.

The initial probabilities from experts ranged from 0% to 40%, with most experts estimating around 10-20%. After reviewing recent news articles, many experts adjusted their probabilities slightly downward or kept them stable, as the focus in the news was on broader immigration reforms like the introduction of the 'Gold Card' visa and legislative efforts to end the Diversity Visa program, rather than issuing a specific presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa. The final probabilities after phase 2 revisions ranged from 0% to 60%, with most experts consolidating their estimates around 10-20%. Overall, the prevailing sentiment is that while immigration remains a priority for Trump's administration, a specific action mentioning the Diversity Visa is not anticipated in the immediate future.",
