According to Minister in the Prime Minister's Department (Law and Institutional Reform) Datuk Seri Azalina Othman Said, the pardons and sentence reductions were granted following petitions submitted under various regulations, including the Federal Constitution. Azalina stated, 'In total, 230 applications were submitted under the Four-Yearly Sentence Review (KHETS), 73 petitions under Regulation 113 of the Prisons Regulations 2000, 38 petitions under Regulation 114, and one application under Article 42 of the Federal Constitution.' The review process follows legal frameworks and due diligence to ensure fairness in granting pardons and commutations, according to Azalina. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 04:03 AM\nSource:[Malay Mail](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2025/02/19/law-minister-reveals-full-pardons-for-106-prisoners-reduced-sentences-for-44-others-in-2024/167205)\n\n**Truth review - Julian Assange play is hard going, with flashes of brilliance**\nThe play 'Truth' by Patricia Cornelius and directed by Susie Dee, is a hard-hitting but ultimately disappointing drama about Julian Assange and the world of global geopolitics. The play features five actors playing Assange, but instead of exploring different perspectives, they form a united chorus of complaint. The playwright's central motivation seems to be grievance, which she grinds into the narrative. While there are flashes of brilliance, particularly in the scenes involving Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden, the play is marred by a lack of nuance and ambiguity. The script is often repetitive and dour, but the actors bring colour and depth to their characters. The production is sharp and articulate, with innovative direction and design, but ultimately, the play fails as an act of agitprop and is unlikely to shift opinion on Assange's legacy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 01:21 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2025/feb/19/truth-review-julian-assange-play-is-hard-going-with-flashes-of-brilliance)\n\n**Assange visitors' lawsuit against CIA dismissed by US judge**\nA US judge, John Koeltl, dismissed a lawsuit against the CIA by journalists and lawyers who claimed the intelligence agency illegally spied on them while they visited Julian Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London. The judge cited the state secrets privilege, saying that revealing whether the CIA gathered intelligence in the embassy could have 'serious national security repercussions for the United States.' The plaintiffs, including journalists Charles Glass and John Goetz, and lawyers Deborah Hrbek and Margaret Kunstler, had sought an injunction to destroy the data collected by Undercover Global in 2017.

This date is not fixed and changes every year, as it depends on the date of Easter, which falls on April 20 in 2025. The purpose of Forgiveness Sunday is to forgive those who have wronged us and to ask for forgiveness from our loved ones, whom we may have offended through words, thoughts, or actions during the year. This tradition of asking for forgiveness before the Great Lent has its roots in ancient times, when Egyptian monks would go into the desert to spend the Lent in solitude. They would ask for forgiveness from their brothers before leaving, as if it were their last day on earth. Today, Forgiveness Sunday is a unique Orthodox tradition, as it does not exist in Western Christianity (Catholics and Protestants). The author notes that the words 'to forgive' and 'to excuse' have different meanings, and that it is easier to say 'excuse me' than 'forgive me'. The author explains that 'excuse me' means to make oneself innocent, while 'forgive me' means to acknowledge one's guilt and ask for forgiveness. In Forgiveness Sunday, it is customary to say 'Forgive me, a sinner, and I will forgive' and to receive forgiveness from God and from others. The author concludes that asking for forgiveness is a way to simplify our relationships with people and with God, as we pray in the Lord's Prayer to forgive our sins 'as we forgive those who sin against us'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:58 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/articles/proshhjonoe-voskresene-2025-istorija-kogda-otmechat-i-kak-pravilno-prosit-proshhenija-u-blizkih_1157507)\n\n**Court dismisses Assange visitors' lawsuit against CIA**\nA US judge, John Koeltl, dismissed a lawsuit against the CIA by journalists and lawyers who claimed the agency illegally spied on them while they visited Julian Assange at Ecuador's embassy in London.

Assange was released from a British prison on June 24, 2024, after a deal with the US prosecution office, in which he partially admitted guilt. He was sentenced to five years for conspiring to obtain and disclose US national defense information, which he has already served. The trial took place on the island of Saipan, the largest in the Northern Mariana Islands, which are under US control. This admission allowed him to be released after five years in prison. After this, several activist organizations and Australian parliamentarians have asked for Assange's pardon. 'Julian Assange should not have been charged, he should not have been in prison, especially for so long. Julian Assange is probably the best journalist in the world and probably the most honest journalist. I would like to hope that he will be pardoned. But I'm not being optimistic. I'm saying this because at the end of Trump's first term as president, there was such an opportunity. When he was running for his first presidential term, he said, 'Julian seems like a good guy, I don't understand why we're bothering him. We need to figure this out and let him go,' - noted Low. But when Trump became president, he did not pardon Assange, recalled the interlocutor. 'Trump's words do not match his actions. At the end of his term, he had the chance to pardon Julian Assange, but he did not. Instead, he pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, who was in prison. Why did Trump act incorrectly? Because Trump actually doesn't want to act correctly. But I have hope again, I'm an optimist... I hope he will be pardoned, that everything will start from scratch for him,' - added Low. Assange gained worldwide fame by founding WikiLeaks, where hundreds of thousands of confidential materials about wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Guantanamo Bay prison, diplomatic dispatches, and Hillary Clinton's personal correspondence were published. In 2010, the site leaked a secret video showing US military personnel killing at least 18 civilians after a US helicopter attack in Baghdad in 2007. In the US, WikiLeaks founder was charged with 18 crimes, which could have resulted in up to 175 years in prison due to the disclosure of the largest information leak in US history. \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 01:58 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250218/assanzh-1999956562.html)\n\n**Lapointe: Yes, Trump Derangement Syndrome is a real thing**\nAuthor Lapointe argues that 'Trump Derangement Syndrome' is a valid reaction to President Donald Trump's behavior. He claims that Trump is a dangerous buffoon who is attacking various institutions, including medical research, consumer protection, and the Department of Education. Trump has also pardoned over 1,500 individuals who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and has put them back on the streets. Lapointe criticizes Trump's foreign policy, including his plan to deport millions of people, mostly Latin Americans, and his proposal to transfer public education money to private and religious schools. He also argues that Trump's 'school choice' policy is a euphemism for a wolf in sheep's clothing, as it would weaken teachers' unions and steer more money away from students who need it most. Lapointe concludes that Trump's momentum could carry over to the mid-term elections in 2026, making things worse before they get better.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[metrotimes.com](https://www.metrotimes.com/news/lapointe-yes-trump-derangement-syndrome-is-a-real-thing-38600948)\n\n**Trump's Pardon of Ross Ulbricht Sparks Hope for Crypto Community**\nFollowing US President Donald Trump's decision to pardon Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, the cryptocurrency community is closely watching for potential pardons. On the blockchain-based prediction market Polymarket, various figures, including Roger Ver and Julian Assange, have seen trades opened for potential pardons. With a 10 million dollar plus trading volume, early Bitcoin investor Roger Ver is at the top of the list with a 32% chance of being pardoned. The pardon decision is seen as a step towards Trump's pro-crypto policies, which he promised during his election campaign. Data from the prediction markets shows that expectations for new pardon decisions in the sector are increasing. The probability of pardon for FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried is at 4%, while it is 24% for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and whistleblower Edward Snowden. Trump's 2024 presidential election campaign promises include creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve and opening the first crypto-focused position at the White House. Ulbricht's pardon is seen as the first tangible step towards these promises. Trades on Polymarket for Bankman-Fried's pardon have reached 227,000 dollars. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison for seven different crimes.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 10:13 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/kripto-para/kripto-sektorunde-trump-in-af-kararlari-yakindan-18292924-haberi/)\n\n**Press Freedom Organizations Urge Biden to Pardon Julian Assange**\nA coalition of press freedom and civil rights organizations has urged US President Joe Biden to grant a pardon to WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange. According to these groups, the measure aims to reduce the damage caused by his 2024 conviction, resulting from a guilty plea, to press freedom. Seth Stern, director of the Foundation for Press Defense, warned that 'the Assange case has established a dangerous precedent by normalizing the criminalization of fundamental activities for national security journalism, such as talking to sources, obtaining documents from them, and publishing them. This provides future authoritarian leaders, both in the US and abroad, with a perfect tool to divert attention from their own repressive actions, including the imprisonment of journalists under false espionage charges.' Stern added: 'A pardon will not correct the damage caused to free press, nor the intimidating effect on journalists who now know that their work could lead to imprisonment by arbitrary decision of the Department of Justice. However, it will contribute to mitigating that damage.' Finally, he emphasized: 'If Biden wants to be remembered as the defender of press freedom that he claims to be, he must prioritize the future of the First Amendment over his personal feelings about Assange and grant this pardon before leaving office.' Rebecca Vincent, director of campaigns at Reporters Without Borders, also stated: 'The US government must show that it takes press freedom seriously.' Vincent added: 'We feel great relief to see Assange now free and in the process of recovery after 14 years in prison, but the terms of the guilty plea still leave open the possibility of future threats to journalism.' She emphasized: 'The message must be clear and unequivocal: the US government must show that it takes press freedom seriously and that the Espionage Act will never again be used improperly to attack an editor, journalist, or journalistic source.' Chip Gibbons, director of policy at Defending Rights & Dissent, also intervened to point out that 'at this moment, the Department of Justice has received the signal that it can act with impunity to prosecute legitimate journalism under the Espionage Act. No journalist is safe. President Biden must guarantee press freedom and grant a full and unconditional pardon to Mr. Assange.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 09:24 AM\nSource:[P\u00fablico.es](https://www.publico.es/internacional/eeuu/organizaciones-defensoras-libertad-prensa-exigen-biden-indulte-assange.html)\n\n**Federal MPs urge President Biden to pardon Assange**\nFederal MPs in Australia have written a letter to US President Joe Biden, urging him to grant Julian Assange a full pardon before leaving office.

Seth Stern, Director of Advocacy at the Freedom of the Press Foundation, explained, 'A pardon won't undo the harm the case has done to the free press or the chilling effect on journalists, but it will help reduce the damage.' The organizations also stated, 'No one should ever again face such treatment for publishing information in the public interest.' They urge Biden to 'set the record straight and ensure his legacy is one of protecting press freedom' by pardoning Assange. 'The US government's pursuit of WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange remains one of the most abusive attacks on press freedom in recent memory,' they added. 'No journalist is safe.

Assange has been free since his plea deal in 2023, but the conviction has set a dangerous precedent for freedom of the press and speech. The campaign, led by Assange's brother Gabriel Shipton, has collected over 30,000 signatures and has been endorsed by members of Congress. Shipton said, 'Now that the process is over, it's up to Biden to decide whether to support freedom of the press or not.' The petition states, 'Julian is free, but justice awaits.

The Free Assange movement has launched a campaign to gather signatures on a petition asking Biden to grant the Australian journalist a pardon. We spoke with Gabriel Shipton, Assange's brother, about the campaign. 'The fact is, the Assange verdict is not just about Julian,' Gabriel said. 'Yes, the stigma of 'convicted felon' puts some limitations on him; but the most worrying thing is the limitation that the verdict puts on freedom of speech and freedom of journalism.' The conviction against Assange constitutes a 'dangerous precedent' that can be used to prosecute individuals who manage to uncover inconvenient truths.

In the United States, presidential pardons are often given towards the end of a presidential term, and are relatively rare events. Assuming about 100 significant pardons from among thousands of applicants or cases brought to the public attention annually, the base rate for a high-profile pardon within a set period like a presidential term could be roughly estimated at 5%. This estimate considers the exclusivity and political sensitivity surrounding such decisions.",

The Biden administration has faced pressure from some factions to support whistleblowers and transparency as part of broader civil rights agendas. However, considering Assange's case involves sensitive matters of national security, the effect is counterbalanced. Nevertheless, the political benefit of such a move remains contentious and limited.",
