The products may contain the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause serious health consequences, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. The FDA has stated that the recall was initiated voluntarily by the company. This is one of several recent recalls related to Listeria contamination. According to the CDC, Listeria can spread through food processing facilities and even through refrigerated foods. 'If we eat contaminated foods with Listeria, the germs can infect us and cause a harmful infection,' the agency warns. A recent report by the US Government Accountability Office found that federal agencies such as the CDC, FDA, and USDA were not meeting their goals for reducing foodborne illnesses. A Gallup poll in September 2024 found that public trust in government guarantees of food safety had reached a 'historic low'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 07:29 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN \u00c9POCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/fda-eleva-2-nivel-mas-alto-retiro-2-millones-cajas-donas-1333094.html)\n\n**Frozen prawns recalled; some distributed in Minnesota**\nSlade Gorton & Co is issuing a voluntary recall of its 'ICYBAY' cooked, ready-to-eat, frozen langostinos (prawns) due to the potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in vulnerable individuals. The product was sold in 1-pound and 5-pound clear plastic packages with specific UPC and expiration dates. The recall includes production dates of July 18, 2007 through Aug. 13, 2007 and/or Julian dates of 199 through 232. The recalled ICYBAY cooked langostinos were distributed to retailers in Massachusetts and Maryland, and to wholesalers in Minnesota and 18 other states.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 01:41 PM\nSource:[Twin Cities](https://www.twincities.com/2008/03/18/frozen-prawns-recalled-some-distributed-in-minnesota-2/)\n\n**Another Food Recall? More Than 2 Million Donuts Just Got Pulled**\nMore than 2 million donuts have been recalled across the U.S. and Canada due to potential Listeria contamination. The recall, issued by FGF Brands, LLC, includes donuts sold under multiple brand names, including Dunkin' and grocery store private labels. Consumers may not see FGF Brands on the packaging, so checking the specific product type and the expiration date is key. According to the FDA, this is classified as a Class II recall, meaning the health risk is temporary or medically reversible for most people. However, Listeria infections can be severe for pregnant individuals, older adults, and those with weakened immune systems. The FDA urges consumers to check their donut packages for expiration dates on or before December 13, 2024, and to stop eating the affected products immediately.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 01:28 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniegravalese/2025/02/08/another-food-recall-more-than-2-million-donuts-just-got-pulled/)\n\n**Lidl Issues Recall for Beef Sausages Due to Potential Health Risk**\nLidl has issued a recall for its Runder Saucijzen (beef sausages) with a minimum shelf life of January 18, 2025, due to the presence of STEC bacteria, which can pose a health risk. According to Lidl, customers from North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) who regularly shop in the Netherlands may be affected. The bacteria can cause severe health problems, including bloody diarrhea and in extreme cases, hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), which can lead to kidney failure. Lidl has taken steps to review its production processes to prevent such incidents in the future. In the meantime, customers who have purchased the affected sausages in the past few weeks are advised not to consume them and to return them to the store for a full refund. As Lidl's spokesperson said, 'Safety comes first, so it's better to return the sausages and get a full refund.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 01:06 AM\nSource:[Der Westen](https://www.derwesten.de/region/nrw-lidl-rueckruf-wuerstchen-gefahr-gesundheit-niederlande-aufgepasst-id301339227.html)\n\n**Michigan: Lays Potato Chip Recall At FDA\u2019s Highest Level**\nFrito Lay has issued a recall for their Lay's potato chips across the US, including Michigan, due to undeclared milk ingredients. The recall, initially issued in December 2024, has been upgraded to the highest threat level by the FDA, warning that consuming the chips could lead to adverse health consequences, particularly for those with severe milk allergies or sensitivity. The recalled bags have a 'Guaranteed Fresh Date' of Feb. 11, 2025, and UPC number 28400 31041. As the author notes, 'it's always shocking when popular food items are placed on recall,' and this recall serves as a reminder of the importance of following food safety guidelines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[wfnt.com](https://wfnt.com/ixp/1161/p/michigan-lays-potato-chip-recall/)\n\n**Mass recall issued for supermarket donut and pastry items**\nOver 2 million cases of assorted donuts from FGF LLC have been recalled due to a potential ongoing listeria contamination across the United States and Canada. The recall includes 60 different products, such as cake donut rings and Dunkin' Donuts products, with expiration dates from December 13, 2024, and before. The FDA has classified the recall as a Class II, meaning it poses a lower risk of causing serious harm. However, those infected with Listeriosis, caused by Listeria monocytogenes, are more vulnerable to serious harm, particularly pregnant women, those 65 or older, or with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and convulsions, and in pregnant women, it can lead to miscarriages, still births, or life-threatening infections in newborns. Affected products should be discarded or returned for a full refund, and surfaces and utensils should be thoroughly sanitized. The recall comes after a similar recall of broccoli sold in Walmart across 20 states due to listeria bacteria. The FDA has updated the broccoli recall to a 'Class I' due to the potential for serious adverse health consequences or death.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14375845/donut-recall-pastries-fgf-brands-listeria-contamination.html)\n\n**Salad Recalls That Affected Millions**\nSalad recalls have affected millions of people in the US, with issues ranging from undeclared allergens to contamination with bacteria like listeria, salmonella, and E. coli. In 2024, Taylor Farms Pacific recalled 19,900 pounds of salad bowls due to undeclared wheat, which affected Kroger stores in 12 states. Other recalls include Ready Pac Foods' 222,915 pounds of salad products containing undeclared anchovies, and Kraft's 83,800 cases of American cheese slices containing pieces of plastic packaging. In 2022, Tyson recalled almost 100,000 pounds of ground beef due to a 'mirror-like material.' Experts warn that even healthy salads can harbor bacteria, and that foodborne illness can be serious and even fatal for vulnerable individuals. The FDA and USDA have issued recalls for various products, including chicken salad, eggs, and flour, due to contamination with bacteria and undeclared allergens.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/salad-recalls-affected-millions-204058409.html)\n\n**Two million cases of donuts recalled over contamination risk**\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a report on a nationwide recall of over two million donut products due to a potential contamination with listeria monocytogenes. According to the FDA, 2,017,614 cases of the different baked goods have been recalled, including cake donut rings, raspberry-filled donuts, and Dunkin' Donut's products. The voluntary recall from FGF, LLC affects all baked goods within expiration produced 12/13/24 and prior. This is a Class II recall, meaning a situation in which use of or exposure to a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences. The FDA has also issued recalls for other products, including Braga Fresh's ready-to-eat broccoli florets and D. Coluccio & Sons' chocolate drops, due to listeria and tree nut allergies risks, respectively.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 05:41 PM\nSource:[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/donuts-recalled-listeria-fda-fgf-brands-b2694694.html)\n\n**2 million donut products recalled nationwide over listeria risk: FDA**\nThe FDA has issued a recall of over 2 million cases of baked goods, including donuts and cake rings, due to the possible presence of listeria monocytogenes.

According to the FDA, the recalled products 'may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences.' The CDC warns that listeria poses a danger to pregnant women, young children, people over 65, and those with weakened immune systems, and may cause symptoms such as fever, headache, and seizures. FGF, LLC has recalled just over 2,017,600 cases of products with expiration dates prior to December 13, 2024, which were distributed nationwide and in Canada.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:14 PM\nSource:[FOX21 News](https://www.fox21news.com/news/national/2-million-donut-products-recalled-nationwide-over-listeria-risk-fda/)\n\n**USDA Recall Report: January 2025 USDA Recall Report: January 2025 USDA Recall Report: January 2025**\nThe US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recalled 3 products and issued 3 health alerts in January 2025.
