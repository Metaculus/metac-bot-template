Trump made the appeal on his Truth Social account, saying, 'We need both chambers to pass the proposed budget to start the reconciliation process and move all our priorities into one beautiful bill, to make America great again without any questions.' Trump inherited the issue of an uncoordinated budget from the previous administration led by Joe Biden, which had agreed on a temporary budget until March 14, 2025. If a new decision on appropriations is not made by then, the government may cease operations. However, with Republicans holding a majority in both chambers of Congress, it is unlikely that there will be any issues with coordination.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 03:56 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250219/tramp-2000380382.html)\n\n**Maybe we need a government shutdown**\nWith the federal government funded until March 14, there is a possibility of a government shutdown if the Republican House and Senate fail to pass a bill before the deadline. Senate Democrat Whip Dick Durbin said, 'I never support a shutdown, but I can see where it could happen in this situation. It's an extreme situation.' A shutdown could be beneficial for President Trump and DOGE Chair Musk, as it would highlight which federal government services are truly 'essential services.' The concept of 'essential services' originated with President Jimmy Carter and his Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti in 1980, but their views may not align with the current administration's. DOGE has saved the federal government over $55 billion and continues to expose wasteful expenditures, which a shutdown could further illuminate. The only potential opponents of a shutdown are Social Security recipients over 120 years old.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 03:52 PM\nSource:[American Thinker](https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2025/02/maybe_we_need_a_government_shutdown.html)\n\n**St Patrick's Day: Taoiseach's visit to White House in doubt**\nThe Taoiseach's St Patrick's Day trip to the White House is in doubt due to concerns that it will clash with a potential US government shutdown. The US federal government is at risk of shutting down on March 14, the day Miche\u00e1l Martin is expected to visit the White House, unless the Democrats agree to approve a funding bill. A senior Government source said, 'We are pragmatic, we are keeping an eye on things. Our embassy is keeping a close eye on things. We are monitoring all that is happening in the US very closely, but we have a plan marked out for the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste to visit the US.' However, concerns have been raised about the optics of having a St Patrick's Day party in the White House if thousands of federal employees are left without pay. The event may be cancelled if the shutdown occurs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 01:02 AM\nSource:[irishexaminer.com](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/politics/arid-41577289.html)\n\n**'Beware': Analyst spots bizarre irony as Republicans 'box themselves into corner'**\nHouse Republicans have 'boxed themselves into a corner' by alienating Democrats, making it unlikely they will help keep the government open, according to MSNBC columnist Michael A. Cohen. Cohen noted a particular irony: the government funding expiry date is March 15, the 'Ides of March', the date of Julius Caesar's assassination. He said, 'The potential of a government shutdown is the only leverage Democrats have to stop Trump and Elon Musk's assault on the federal government.' Democrats have become more opposed to working with Republicans, with 65% now wanting their leaders to oppose Trump, a 38-point shift in just a month. Republicans are also pushing for sharp tax cuts for the rich, paid for by slashing Medicaid and food assistance, with a historically narrow House majority. Cohen concluded, 'Republicans have given Democrats every reason to hold the line in March. The question now is whether congressional Democrats are up to the task.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 01:43 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/gop-shutdown-march/)\n\n**Charleroi's 'psy-jeunes' Service to be Shut Down Due to Lack of Funding**\nIn Charleroi, the 'psy-jeunes' service, which provides mental health support to young people, will be shut down in 10 days due to a lack of funding. According to PTB councillor K\u00fcbra Ygitoglu, 20% of young people are experiencing depression, 33% are suffering from anxiety, and 20% are thinking about suicide. Only half of them can receive follow-up care. The pandemic has led to increased isolation and persistent mental health issues among young people, and the situation has worsened, with suicide now being the leading cause of death among 15-45 year olds. The specialized mental health services are struggling to keep up, and the psychiatric hospitals are seeing a reduction in available places. The 'psy-jeunes' project, which was launched by the previous federal government and funded by 613,201 euros, has been successful in recruiting 8 psychologists who have followed 521 young people individually, with 15 requests per week. However, due to the lack of budget for 2025, the project has not been renewed, and it will be shut down in 10 days, despite the new federal government's apparent concern. As Ayse Aktas, the councillor in charge of Health, explained, 'Le Signe', an open aid center, has played a crucial role in fighting school dropout, but the situation has worsened, and the services are struggling to cope.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[DH.be](https://www.dhnet.be/regions/charleroi/2025/02/18/faute-de-subsides-le-service-psy-jeunes-a-charleroi-sera-stoppe-dans-dix-jours-42JMQLKUX5FS5J2A525KCZW7C4/)\n\n**Opinion | Trump and the GOP have boxed themselves into a corner**\nPresident Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are facing a government shutdown deadline on March 15, but Democrats have little reason to cooperate with House Speaker Mike Johnson and his caucus. Trump's actions, including attempting to freeze federal spending and canceling agencies without congressional approval, have weakened the incentives for Democrats to work with Republicans. A recent poll shows that 65% of Democrats now want their party leaders to oppose Trump rather than work with him. With Republicans controlling the White House and both houses of Congress, they should be able to pass a funding bill without Democratic help, but their track record of iconoclasm and Trump's extremism have created uncertainty. Democrats see the potential for a government shutdown as their only leverage to stop Trump's assault on the federal government, and they have little choice but to hold the line in March.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 11:39 AM\nSource:[MSNBC.com](https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-mike-johnson-government-shutdown-resolution-rcna192114)\n\n**Congress closing in on shutdown deadline with no clear plan**\nCongress is racing against a March 14 deadline to prevent a government shutdown, but a deal to keep the government funded is still elusive. House Appropriations Committee Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said, 'We can\u2019t have precisely the same kind of deal we had before, and we\u2019re trying to work to find some common ground.' However, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (Conn.) expressed concerns about the process, saying, 'We cannot come to a deal where you hammer out gains, losses, but you come to a conclusion and you come to a meeting of the minds.' The House Armed Services Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) has expressed opposition to a full-year continuing resolution (CR), saying, 'It would have to be like we passed an appropriations bill for defense.' Some Republicans are pushing for a budget reconciliation package to pass a partisan funding package that would boost dollars in areas like border and defense. However, House Republicans are still pushing to take the lead on a reconciliation package that would also plus up border and defense funds, but would additionally greenlight trillions of dollars in tax cuts and significant spending cuts. Congress is also staring down the threat of automatic cuts to federal programs after April 30.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[biztoc.com](https://thehill.com/business/budget/5149928-congress-struggles-government-funding-shutdown/?ref=biztoc.com)\n\n**US colleges, schools given two weeks to shut down diversity initiative**\nThe US education department has issued a warning to schools and colleges, giving them 14 days to shut down diversity initiatives, citing a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that declared race-based college admissions unlawful. The department's acting assistant secretary for civil rights, Craig Trainor, stated that treating people differently based on their race violates the law. The new directive applies to staffing, services, and student life, and is part of the Trump administration's efforts to remove diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives from the federal government. The department has also cancelled $600 million in grants focused on training teachers in critical race theory and other topics. Trainor said, 'If an educational institution treats a person differently because of their race, it violates the law.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 07:40 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/news/story/us-colleges-schools-given-two-weeks-to-shut-down-dei-initiative-2681681-2025-02-18)\n\n**We're 1 Month From a Government Shutdown\u2014The Talks Are a Mess**\nThe US government is on the verge of a shutdown, with just one month left before the funding deadline on March 14.

This move would give them leverage over Trump and Musk. Earlier, Biden signed a law extending government funding until March 14, 2025. Some Democratic Party members believe the US is on the brink of a constitutional crisis, and are weighing the option of shutting down the government. Senator Andy Kim stated, 'I'm not interested in funding Trump's government.' Democratic leaders are under pressure from party members, but the decision to shut down the government does not have full party support. To pass a law extending government funding, the Senate needs 60 votes, and it will not be passed without the support of at least some Democratic senators.

The bill, which was passed by Congress last year to avoid a debt default, provides funding for the federal government until March 14. However, the Democratic Party is divided on how to use the deadline to negotiate with the Trump administration. Some Democrats believe that they can use the deadline to launch a tough opposition against the Trump administration, while others are concerned that even if they win policy concessions, Trump will ultimately ignore the results and threaten a shutdown. The Trump administration has been criticized by Democrats for its systematic reduction of federal agencies and expansion of presidential powers. The administration's plan to reduce the staff of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) from over 10,000 to less than 300 has been temporarily blocked by a court. Democrats have also called for an investigation into the administration's 'efficiency department' led by Elon Musk, citing concerns about national security. The US government has faced multiple shutdowns in recent years due to partisan disputes, with the longest one lasting 34 days in 2018-2019.

Schumer added that Senate Democrats will 'use our votes to help steady the ship for the American people in these turbulent times.' Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ) also indicated that Democrats may be willing to use a shutdown as leverage to oppose government reforms, saying, '...for the last two years, [Republicans] needed Democratic votes for every single continuing resolution and they should not count on that this time.'

House Republicans, who control the House, the Senate, and the White House, have not asked for Democratic help, despite needing their votes to pass spending bills. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said, 'Republicans have not opened up any line of communication with us. And they\u2019ve made clear to America that they have a big, massive, beautiful mandate, which presumably means to us that they intend to pass a spending agreement on their own to avoid a government shutdown on their own and to raise the debt ceiling on their own.' The new deadline to avoid a shutdown is March 14. House Republicans are currently focused on passing a 'big, beautiful bill' to cut taxes and slash government spending, but this has distracted them from the appropriations process. Some Republicans are concerned that the party's inaction on spending bills will lead to a government shutdown. 'I think we\u2019re looking at a CR,' lamented one veteran House Republican close to the spending process.

This will trigger a government shutdown, which will affect the payment of government bills, including salaries for 700,000 employees. Yellen wrote in a letter to Congress leaders on Friday that extraordinary measures will be taken to pay government bills until March 14. However, this will put the US at risk of defaulting on its debt for the first time, which could have a ripple effect on the global economy. The US Congress has not passed a government funding bill for the fiscal year 2025, which started on October 1. If the shutdown occurs, it will have severe consequences, including the loss of 7 million jobs and a 5% decline in GDP.

The bill, which was already approved by the House of Representatives on December 20, allows the federal government to maintain current spending levels until March 2025 and includes $100 billion in disaster relief funds and $10 billion in aid for farmers. However, the bill does not include the provision to raise or suspend the debt ceiling requested by former President Trump. The White House has stopped preparing for a government shutdown. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he had spoken with Trump, who was 'happy' with the result. The US government's operating funds should come from an annual budget appropriation, but due to intense partisan fighting, Congress has often failed to pass a new annual appropriation bill by October 1, the start of the new fiscal year. Instead, Congress has passed short-term spending bills to temporarily maintain federal government operations. According to the temporary funding bill passed by Congress in September, federal government funds would expire on December 20. The two parties had previously announced a temporary funding bill on December 17, but it was rejected by Trump. The Republicans then modified the bill, reducing the page count from over 1,500 to 116 and adding a provision to suspend the debt ceiling for two years, but the modified bill was rejected by the House of Representatives on December 19. The current debt ceiling is $31.4 trillion, and the US government's debt has already reached $36 trillion, exceeding the debt ceiling. If the US government cannot extend the debt ceiling or raise it, it will inevitably default on its debt. The US government's last shutdown occurred from December 2018 to January 2019, lasting 35 days, the longest in US history. Professor Li Haodong of the Foreign Affairs College said that although the temporary funding bill has temporarily avoided a shutdown, the two parties will continue to fight over preventing government shutdowns when the bill expires in March 2025. This is a temporary funding bill that can only sustain until the Democratic Party leaves office and gives the new Republican government enough time to re-plan funding. In essence, the passage of the funding bill is a process of political bargaining and a process of redefining government functions and the future direction of the US. The two parties will continue to fiercely debate the future of the funding bill. The US government shutdown crisis has frequently occurred in recent years, and the two parties have repeatedly engaged in extreme tug-of-war over government spending. Li Haodong believes that the 'party struggle' has brought devastating damage to the stability and international image of the US. Firstly, the distrust of the government among the American people will continue to strengthen, which will challenge the stability of the country. The entire country's political and social violence will become more severe. Secondly, the country's challenges cannot be effectively solved. Due to the lack of continuity in domestic and foreign policy, the US government's international credibility and its domestic and foreign policies will be left in a state of 'repeatedly flipping pancakes', which will consume national strength, reputation, and influence. The American public and foreign governments will feel uncertain about the US, and in fact, the US has brought a high degree of uncertainty to the world.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 22, 2024 12:38 PM\nSource:[cri.cn](https://news.cri.cn/20241222/b1a488d0-6880-a41c-4c04-7860c2a83013.html)\n\n**Biden Signs Emergency Appropriations Bill to Prevent US Government Shutdown**\nUS President Biden signed an emergency appropriations bill to prevent the US government from 'shutting down'. The latest bill will continue to provide funding for the US government until March 2025, avoiding a partial shutdown of federal agencies in the US East Coast after 21:00 on December 21. The new bill is almost identical to the one that failed to pass on December 19, but it has deleted the part related to the debt ceiling. It leaves three main parts: a short-term extension of government spending, billions of dollars in disaster relief funds, and additional aid to farmers. The US Congress had previously voted to pass the bill. The US Congress worked late into the night on December 20 and voted to pass the short-term spending bill at 1:00 am on December 21. Just a few hours earlier, the House of Representatives had passed the bill. The White House has stopped preparing for a government shutdown. The US government's operating funds should come from the annual budget appropriation, but the US Congress usually passes a new annual appropriation bill before the new fiscal year begins on October 1. However, due to intense partisan struggles in recent years, they often fail to reach an agreement in time, and Congress passes a short-term spending bill to temporarily maintain the operation of the federal government. Even short-term spending bills cannot avoid partisan calculations, and a budget bill usually undergoes multiple revisions until both parties agree on it. After negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, and partly referring to former President Trump's proposal, the final bill was revised and passed. The bill allows the federal government to maintain its current spending level until March 14, 2025, and includes $100 billion in disaster relief funds and $10 billion in aid to farmers. However, the latest bill does not include the provision to raise the debt ceiling, which was requested by former President Trump. The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt that the US Congress has set for the federal government to fulfill its existing payment obligations, currently at $3.14 trillion. On June 3, 2023, President Biden signed a bill to temporarily suspend the debt ceiling until early 2025, temporarily avoiding the US government's debt default. The bill also limits US government spending for the 2024 and 2025 fiscal years. According to data released by the US Department of the Treasury in late November 2024, the US federal government's debt has reached $36 trillion, far exceeding the current debt ceiling limit of $31.4 trillion. If the US federal government cannot extend the debt ceiling deadline or raise the debt ceiling, the government will inevitably default on its debt. On December 17, the US House of Representatives released a draft of the short-term spending bill, which had been agreed upon by both parties. On December 18, former President Trump suddenly announced his opposition to the 1.0 version of the bill, saying that he would not agree to the bill unless the Democratic Party 'terminates or extends the debt ceiling'. After Trump's opposition, the House of Representatives canceled the vote on the bill scheduled for December 18. In a joint statement on social media, Vice President Harris said that Congress should pass a 'clean' appropriations bill, rather than meeting all the demands of the Democratic Party. The statement also urged Republicans to pressure Democrats to agree to raise the debt ceiling. At the same time, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre released a statement saying that Republicans must stop playing politics with temporary appropriations bills. After the 1.0 version was vetoed by Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and others sought an alternative plan, adding Trump's requested debt ceiling increase provision and removing some unrelated provisions, giving birth to the 2.0 version of the short-term spending bill. On December 19, the US House of Representatives voted on the bill, but it failed to pass due to a lack of the required two-thirds majority. House Republican leaders had to negotiate with Democratic leaders again. Finally, on December 20, just hours before the federal government was set to shut down, the House of Representatives reached an agreement with the Democrats, and the new short-term spending bill was passed. According to reports, the latest bill is almost identical to the one that failed to pass on December 19, but it has deleted the part related to the debt ceiling, leaving three main parts: a short-term extension of government spending, billions of dollars in disaster relief funds, and additional aid to farmers. In recent years, the US two parties have repeatedly engaged in 'extreme budget struggles' and 'last-minute maintenance' of the federal government, with the government shutting down for 34 days in 2018-2019 during Trump's first term. According to estimates, the shutdown caused a loss of approximately $3 billion to the US economy. The White House has stopped preparing for a government shutdown. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 22, 2024 01:32 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202412223275121452.html)\n\n**Joe Biden Signs Temporary US Budget Bill**\nUS President Joe Biden signed a temporary budget bill, which will be in effect until March 14, 2025. According to the White House, 'On Saturday, December 21, Biden signed a law that provides funding for federal agencies until March 14.' The bill was previously delayed in the US Senate, but was eventually passed, preventing a government shutdown. However, the shutdown was only formal, as it occurred over the weekend. If the bill had not been signed, a shutdown could have occurred on Monday. The new law provides funding for disaster relief and assistance to farmers. It does not include Trump's proposed requirements to eliminate or increase the debt ceiling. Most Republicans in Congress supported the bill, despite Trump's opposition, as they were unable to gather enough support for their proposed amendment the day before. It's worth noting that the longest government shutdown in US history occurred during Trump's first term, lasting 35 days.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 21, 2024 05:48 PM\nSource:[versia.ru](https://versia.ru/dzho-bajden-podpisal-zakonoproekt-o-vremennom-byudzhete-ssha)\n\n**US House Approves Budget Extension to Avoid Government Shutdown**\nThe US House of Representatives approved an extension of the federal budget to avoid a government shutdown at midnight due to lack of funds. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers supported the measure, which provides funding until March 14, 2025, and received two-thirds support in the lower chamber. The bill will now move to the Senate, where Democrats have a majority. The proposal received 366 votes in favor and 34 against, suggesting that the US will avoid a government shutdown at the last minute. This became more likely after President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk thwarted a previously agreed-upon deal between Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress. Trump and Musk, who will be responsible for cutting public spending in the future administration, urged the Republican majority in the House to break the agreement and vote for a unilateral plan that was rejected on Thursday due to opposition from Democrats and some Republicans. The approved proposal significantly simplifies the initial bipartisan agreement of 1,547 pages, which had generated complaints from Musk. The plan extends the budget until March 14, 2025, and includes funds for natural disaster prevention and support for farmers, but excludes the elimination of the debt ceiling, a recent demand from Trump. A government shutdown could leave hundreds of thousands of public workers without pay, limit agency operations, and close museums and national parks. This situation would be avoided if the proposal is approved by the Senate.

The base rate approach considers that since 1990, there have been approximately 10 government shutdowns, with a majority spanning less than 10 days. The distribution of shutdown lengths provides a base case: shorter shutdowns are generally more common given political and economic pressures to resolve budgetary disagreements quickly. Let's break it down: 0 days shutdown is relatively less common; 1, 2, or 3-4 days shutdowns are historically more frequent as they often correlate with minor political deadlocks resolved within days; 5-7 days shutdown occurs less frequently; and shutdowns lasting '8 or more' days are less common than shorter spans but have occurred with some regularity.",
