The letter, signed by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Fredrick D. DiSanto, argues that holding the meeting during a period of uncertainty related to the blocked sale to Nippon Steel Corporation would be an 'entrenchment maneuver'. Ancora has nominated nine highly qualified and independent candidates for election to the Board, including industry legend Alan Kestenbaum, who is prepared to step into the Chief Executive Officer role to turn the operations of the Company around. The letter states that shareholders deserve to know the outcome of the Company's 'Hail Mary' litigation before casting their vote, and that delaying the meeting by at least 45 days following the June 18th outside date for unwinding the merger agreement is warranted and appropriate. 'Seeking to hold the Annual Meeting during this period of extraordinary uncertainty while pursuing a blocked deal in defiance of a former president's executive order and a current president's stated opposition would represent a self-serving entrenchment tactic,' the letter says.

However, Nippon Steel's first official statement after a two-week silence differed from Trump's stance. Nippon Steel's President Imai said, 'Investment and equipment investment cannot be separated. Only by investing can we make a large-scale investment decision.' He also emphasized that the US-Japan negotiations started with the original contract to merge US Steel and Nippon Steel. Nippon Steel reaffirmed its plan to acquire US Steel and make it a fully-owned subsidiary. While discussing with the US government to explain the situation to Trump, Nippon Steel's Vice President visited the US on the 12th, but the meeting schedule with Trump's team has not been confirmed. Nippon Steel has repeatedly emphasized its intention to maintain its original stance, making the US Steel-related negotiations with the Trump administration seem inevitable to be difficult.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 01:56 AM\nSource:[YTN](https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0134_202502270906237108)\n\n**Nippon Steel Doubles Down on $14.1-B US Steel Pursuit**\nNippon Steel remains committed to acquiring US Steel (NYSE: X) for $14.1 billion, despite facing political resistance and shifting statements from the White House.

The acquisition was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January, citing national security concerns, and President Donald Trump has echoed similar reservations. Nippon Steel has rejected claims of potential conflicts with US interests as 'littered with factual inaccuracies and omissions.' The proposed takeover may be on the agenda for Japanese Trade Minister Yoji Muto's visit to the US in March.

According to the USW, US Steel has repeatedly attacked the union to weaken it, making it impossible for members to express their opposition to the plan. The union also claims that US Steel's CEO, David Burritt, threatened to withhold funding for union facilities if the deal did not go through. The USW has consistently opposed the acquisition plan since it was announced in December 2024. The union is seeking an injunction to stop Nippon Steel and US Steel from blocking the acquisition and undermining US Steel's competitiveness.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[NHK\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20250226/k10014733731000.html)\n\n**Nippon Steel (X) Leverages Merger Agreement for US Gov't Talks**\nNippon Steel (X) plans to use its current merger agreement with U.S. Steel as a foundation for discussions with the U.S. government.

The companies say the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (Cfius) violated their due process rights by allowing 'virtually no substantive engagement' with the companies. They claim Biden blocked the merger to gain favor with union steelworkers in Pennsylvania while he was seeking re-election. The companies want the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to set aside the 'unlawful' Cfius review and Biden's order to block the deal on national security grounds. They seek a new review. 'There was no ambiguity or equivocation in the president's consistent and definitive statements disapproving the merger, starting in March 2024,' according to the filing. A former Cfius official has also come forward, stating that the review was 'predetermined, thus violating Cfius's statutory and regulatory obligations and practices.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 02:07 PM\nSource:[crainscleveland.com](https://www.crainscleveland.com/manufacturing/us-steel-nippon-blame-politics-merger-block)\n\n**US delays enforcement of Nippon Steel merger block**\nUS authorities have delayed enforcing the block on Nippon Steel Corp's acquisition of US Steel Corp, citing national security concerns.

The companies expressed their 'pleasure' with the extension, stating that they look forward to completing the transaction, which they believe will 'secure the best future for the American steel industry and all our stakeholders.'

The original deadline of February 2 was extended to June 18, as per a request from President Joe Biden to halt the deal earlier this month. A Nippon Steel spokesperson confirmed the extension to the press. The new deadline coincides with the expected completion date of the merger. The decision was made after the two companies submitted a petition to the US Court of Appeals in Washington, arguing that CFIUS had not proven the deal's impact on national security and that President Biden's block was based on 'purely political reasons.' According to a Nikkei report, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is preparing for a visit to the US in early February 2025 to meet with President-elect Donald Trump, where they may discuss the Nippon Steel deal.\nOriginal language: vi\nPublish date: January 12, 2025 01:02 PM\nSource:[vietnamplus.vn](https://www.vietnamplus.vn/thuong-vu-nippon-steel-thau-tom-us-steel-duoc-gia-han-them-4-thang-post1007153.vnp)\n\n**Nippon, US Steel sue Biden administration over blocked merger**\nU.S. Steel and Nippon Steel sued the Biden administration over a decision to block their proposed $14 billion merger, citing election-season political considerations. The companies allege that the administration used the government review process as a pretext to reject the merger as a favor to the United Steelworkers (USW) labor union. According to the lawsuit, President Biden first announced plans to block the merger in March 2024, before the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) began its review of the national security implications of the deal. The USW has 1.2 million members, with a large concentration in the influential swing state of Pennsylvania. As Biden said, 'Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.' However, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel claim that this decision was motivated by a promise made to the USW leadership, rather than genuine national security concerns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 05:48 PM\nSource:[abc7news.com](https://abc7news.com/post/nippon-us-steel-file-suit-after-biden-administration-blocks-15-billion-deal/15763606/)\n\n**Nippon Steel and US Steel File Complaint Against Biden's Blockage of Merger Operation**\nNippon Steel Corporation and United States Steel Corporation (US Steel) have filed a complaint against the blockage imposed by US President Joe Biden on their merger operation.

In a joint statement, the companies accuse Biden of 'ignoring the Rule of Law' and 'gaining the favor of the United Steelworkers union' to 'support his political agenda' in what they describe as an 'illegal political interference in the process'.

The two companies stated in a joint statement that they will take all necessary measures to protect their legal rights and confirm the fairness of the process. They criticized the US government's Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) for its 'extremely unfair' review of the acquisition plan, which they claim was based on political considerations rather than a thorough investigation. The companies emphasized that they will continue to pursue the acquisition plan, saying, 'We will never give up on conducting business in the United States.' Biden stated that the acquisition plan poses a risk to national security and the stability of the steel industry, and ordered the companies to take all necessary steps to abandon the plan within 30 days. US Steel Workers, a labor union opposed to the acquisition, welcomed the decision, saying, 'This is the right decision for our members and national security.' The acquisition plan was announced by Nippon Steel in December 2023 and was approved by US Steel in April 2024, but it has been embroiled in controversy due to political considerations. The CFIUS reviewed the plan until December 23, 2024, but failed to reach an agreement on the security risks involved, and referred the matter to Biden for a final decision. The situation is complicated by the upcoming presidential election in the US, where both the Democratic and Republican parties have expressed opposition to the acquisition. The stock price of US Steel fell by 6.5% on January 3, 2025, after Biden's announcement, reflecting market concerns about the company's financial performance and the uncertain future of the acquisition plan.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 04, 2025 03:05 AM\nSource:[\u8aad\u58f2\u65b0\u805e\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/economy/20250104-OYT1T50032/)\n\n**Biden Halts Nippon Steel's Bid: A Blow to U.S. Steel Merger | Headlines**\nPresident Joe Biden blocked Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion purchase of U.S. Steel, citing national security concerns, after a year-long review by CFIUS.

Nippon Steel has declined to comment on the decision. The acquisition has faced repeated setbacks since Nippon Steel announced its plan to acquire US Steel in late 2023. Biden has expressed his hope that US Steel be owned and operated by Americans, and former President Trump has also pledged to block the deal if he were to become president again. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) submitted its evaluation report on the acquisition to President Biden on December 24, 2024, and Biden has 15 days to decide whether to approve the deal. Nippon Steel has proposed to maintain US Steel's production capacity for 10 years after the acquisition, giving the US government the right to veto any reduction in production. However, the US Steelworkers Union has rejected this proposal, citing a lack of long-term commitment. The union has been opposed to the merger from the start. US Steel has been struggling financially, with a 12.78% decline in revenue and a 58.52% decline in profit in the third quarter of 2024. The company's stock price has also fallen behind that of its peers. Despite the controversy, Nippon Steel and US Steel remain committed to completing the deal. US Steel CEO David Burritt has said that if the sale to Nippon Steel fails, the company will close its steel plants and may relocate its headquarters out of Pittsburgh. Nippon Steel has promised to invest $3 billion in US Steel, which is crucial for maintaining competitiveness and preserving jobs. Nippon Steel has also pledged to improve US Steel's operations using its advanced production technology, and to maintain the company's name and brand, as well as its Pittsburgh headquarters and production facilities. 'We are confident that this acquisition will protect and promote the development of the US steel industry,' Nippon Steel said.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 02:12 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202501033287326314.html)\n\n**US Steel Stock Drops Pre-Market On Reports Of Biden Blocking Nippon Steel Deal: Retail Sentiment Crumbles**\nU.S. Steel (X) stock dropped as much as 8% in pre-market trade after reports emerged that President Joe Biden will block its acquisition by Japan's Nippon Steel, citing national security concerns. The $14.1 billion deal has faced pushback from the government and the United Steelworkers union. Sources told the Washington Post that Biden opted to kill the deal despite efforts by his senior advisers to sway him. The White House has not issued a formal statement, but both companies have indicated they will pursue legal action once the deal is formally blocked. Retail sentiment around U.S. Steel on Stocktwits has turned extremely bearish, with some investors expressing confidence that the deal will eventually get approved in court, while others say it's unlikely anyone else will want to buy U.S. Steel. 'It's unlikely that anyone other than Nippon Steel would want to buy U.S. Steel,' said one retail investor on the platform. 'Some even expressed solidarity with the decision to keep U.S. Steel American-owned,' according to reports. The collapse of the deal would represent a victory for United Steelworkers union president David McCall, who has been vocal in his opposition to the acquisition. U.S. Steel's stock has dropped more than 30% in 2024 amid the acquisition controversy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 01:54 PM\nSource:[Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd](https://newsable.asianetnews.com/markets/us-steel-stock-drops-pre-market-on-reports-of-biden-blocking-nippon-steel-deal-retail-sentiment-crumbles-spimah)\n\n**Biden Set to Block Nippon-U.S. Steel Merger: A High-Stakes Economic Standoff | Politics**\nU.S. President Joe Biden is poised to block Nippon Steel's $14.9-billion bid to acquire U.S. Steel, potentially ending the contentious merger plan.

The deal was announced in December 2023 and had been under review for a year. Biden said, 'A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains.' The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States had referred the decision to Biden after failing to reach consensus. Nippon Steel had offered concessions, including giving the U.S. government veto power over changes to output, but analysts say another buyer could emerge. United Steelworkers President David McCall praised Biden's decision, saying it was 'the right move for our members and our national security.' Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had urged Biden to approve the merger, but Biden's decision may dissuade international investors from bidding for politically sensitive U.S. companies.

The decision, made despite efforts by some senior advisers to approve the deal, is seen as a blow to the merger plan. Nippon Steel had offered to move its US headquarters to Pittsburgh and honour all agreements with the US Steel union, but the deal still faced opposition from the powerful United Steelworkers union and politicians. Alistair Ramsey, vice president of steel research at Rystad Energy, said blocking the deal may dissuade international investors from bidding for US companies with unionized workforces. Nippon Steel has vowed to fight the decision in the courts, but experts say it would be a difficult challenge. The collapse of the deal will prompt a major rethink of Nippon Steel's overseas-focused growth strategy, and the company faces a $565m penalty payment to US Steel.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 03, 2025 10:14 AM\nSource:[RTE.ie](https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0103/1488936-us-steel-deal/)\n\n**Nippon reportedly adds 10-year guarantee to not reduce US Steel production if deal goes through**\nNippon Steel is making a final push to acquire U.S. Steel by offering a 10-year guarantee that it will not reduce production in six states, including Pennsylvania, if the deal goes through. According to The Washington Post, a document sent to the White House reveals this guarantee. President Joe Biden is set to make a decision on the multi-billion dollar merger by January 7. In a statement, Nippon Steel said the acquisition is still under review, and the closing date has been revised to the first quarter of 2025.

    "summary": "After reviewing initial analyses and subsequent news updates, the consensus among forecasting experts is that the probability of the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapsing before April 1, 2025, has increased from initial estimates. Initially, experts estimated the likelihood of collapse ranging from 15% to 55%, with common factors being regulatory scrutiny, economic conditions, and political challenges. Upon reassessment in phase 2, influenced by news of significant political and union opposition, the estimated probabilities were revised upwards by most experts, generally ranging now from 45% to 65%. Factors reinforcing the likelihood include strong political resistance from both the Biden and Trump administrations, citing national security concerns, as well as active opposition from the United Steelworkers union and internal shareholder unrest. Despite Nippon Steel's continued commitment to the merger and efforts to negotiate with the U.S. government, the prevailing political and regulatory environment presents substantial challenges to the merger's completion.",
