According to Fadeyev, this would be a long-term process, rather than a one-time payment. The US has been interested in acquiring Greenland since the 19th century, due to its rich natural resources, including oil, gas, and rare earth metals. Trump previously made a proposal to Denmark in 2019, but was rejected. Fadeyev stated, 'In the US, there is a competition between presidents - it's very important to show results in the first 100 days of their presidency, so these days for Trump will be very busy and active, and I'm sure that Greenland, which is in his focus, is an example of his vision and strategic thinking. He thinks exclusively through the prism of business, and everything he does has the potential for commercialization. I think that the decision to start the process of acquiring Greenland will be made in the next 100 days of Trump's presidency.' Fadeyev also noted that the purchase would not be a one-time payment, but rather a long-term contract or concession, where Denmark would receive certain benefits over a long period of time. He believes that the US would use an economic multi-vector mechanism to acquire Greenland, as it would be difficult to evaluate the cost of such a purchase. Fadeyev also mentioned that the US may use economic or military pressure on Denmark and Europe if they refuse to sell Greenland, but considers this possibility to be low. He stated, 'I think that for European countries it would be more expensive not to agree to the sale of Greenland. Trump will go to the end and achieve his goal.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 12:21 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421](https://tass.ru/politika/23124737)\n\n**Trump's Greenland Plan Gets Even More Absurd**\nDonald Trump's plan to annex Greenland and bring it under US control has caused a stir. Initially, it was thought to be a joke, but it soon became clear that Trump was serious. According to reports, Trump had been considering the idea before taking office and was willing to use military and economic pressure to gain control of the island. Now, a Trump supporter, Buddy Carter, has proposed a bill that would allow Trump to negotiate the purchase of Greenland and rename it 'Red, White and Blueland'. Carter seems to be taking the plan seriously, saying, 'President Trump has correctly identified the purchase of today's Greenland as a national security priority, and we will welcome its people with pride into the freest nation on earth when our chief negotiator signs this monumental agreement.'

Greenland's strategic location and natural resources, including rare earth metals, precious stones, and oil, make it a valuable asset. China and Russia are also vying for control of the island, and Trump's plan could be a way to counter their influence. Greenland's prime minister, Mute Egede, has expressed opposition to the idea, but Trump has hinted at military intervention if a deal can't be reached. The stakes are high, with the US, Russia, and China engaging in a geostrategic rivalry in the Arctic. As Vladimir Barbin, Russia's ambassador to Denmark, said, 'attempts to ensure U.S. national security at the expense of other nations may result in further deterioration of the situation in the Arctic, which Russia will take into account in its military planning.' Trump's interest in Greenland is also driven by its potential for space power projection, with the US needing infrastructure in the Arctic Circle to control its satellites. The US has a military presence in Greenland, and Trump is considering options such as statehood or a 'Freely Associated State' status, which would grant Greenland financial assistance in exchange for a US military presence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 07:10 AM\nSource:[grandforksherald.com](https://www.grandforksherald.com/opinion/columns/commentary-trump-means-business-with-his-greenland-proposal)\n\n**Trump's Greenland Ambitions Spark Concerns**\nDonald Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., visited Greenland on January 7, 2025, and met with local residents. Trump Jr. stated that the visit was a private trip and that he wanted to see the beauty of the Arctic Circle and talk to the people. However, the visit has sparked concerns and anxiety among the local residents, as Trump Jr.'s father, Donald Trump, has been making statements about acquiring Greenland, including the possibility of using military force. Trump Jr. said that his father would 'treat' the people of Greenland well if they were to become part of the United States. The visit has also raised questions about the future of Greenland's autonomy and its relationship with Denmark. Greenland has been seeking greater autonomy and has been granted the right to hold an independence referendum. The island's residents are concerned about the potential consequences of becoming a US territory, including the loss of their social welfare system and the potential for exploitation of their natural resources. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/853586364_220095?scm=10001.2024_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0.a2_5X151X618)\n\n**Greenland's Potential Shift: Trump Junior's Visit Sparks Speculation**\nDonald Trump Junior visited Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on January 7, 2025.

According to sources, the purpose of Don Jr.'s visit is to film content for his podcast, 'Triggered with Don Jr.'. The podcast, launched in January 2023, is the most listened to on Rumble, a platform popular with conservative Americans. Trump has welcomed the trip on Truth Social, while reiterating his ambition to annex Canada. The visit has been met with interest from the Danish press, with several media outlets covering the event live. The trip is part of a broader imperialist project, with Trump and his allies aiming to expand US territory. The project includes the annexation of Canada and the construction of a canal in Panama. A map showing a US expansion to the Mediterranean and the South China Sea has been viewed over 5 million times on X, a social media platform. The map is part of a trend known as 'Ameriwank', where users reimagine the US map with alternative histories. Trump's proposal to annex Greenland is seen as a serious idea by some, with one advisor stating that expansion is a time-honored American tradition. The majority of Canadians oppose the idea of becoming the 51st US state, with only 13% in favor.

According to Fox News, the trip is scheduled to start on Tuesday, January 7. Trump Jr. will reportedly meet with local residents and visit cultural sites in the capital city of Nuuk. 'As someone who has traveled to several interesting places around the world as a tourist, I'm excited to have some fun in Greenland this week,' Trump Jr. said. However, a source close to the Trump family revealed that the trip is actually a one-day excursion to film a humorous video for a podcast. This comes after Donald Trump Sr. tweeted that the US considers control over Greenland 'absolutely necessary for national security and freedom around the world.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:37 AM\nSource:[lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2025/01/06/syn-trampa-sobralsya-v-grenlandiyu-posle/)\n\n**Donald Trump Jr. to Visit Greenland Amid Father's Claim of Strategic Importance**\nDonald Trump Jr., the 47-year-old son of the designated US President Donald Trump, is reportedly planning to visit Greenland. According to Fox News and The Hill, he will arrive in the capital Nuuk on Tuesday. Trump Jr. stated, 'As someone who has traveled to some fascinating places around the world as a nature lover, I'm looking forward to making a stop in Greenland this week to have some fun.' He plans to meet locals, visit cultural sites, and record material for videos and podcasts. Trump Jr. has not been publicly assigned to any official position in his father's government, but he was actively involved in the presidential campaign. Greenland is strategically important due to its location in the Arctic, proximity to Russia, potential mineral resources, and a significant US military base. Denmark has previously rejected Trump's proposal to buy the island, which is approximately six times the size of Germany and has a population of around 56,000.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 12:18 AM\nSource:[ln-online.de](https://www.ln-online.de/politik/trump-sohn-donald-jr-will-nach-groenland-reisen-CTSXDDFVEFIQ3NKXMKKBUAKBAE.html)\n\n",
