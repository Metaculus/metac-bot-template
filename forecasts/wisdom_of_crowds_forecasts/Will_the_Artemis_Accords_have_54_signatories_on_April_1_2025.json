The agreement, which was initially set to be signed on March 28, was put on hold due to a public feud between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky over issues such as US security guarantees and their perception of Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, after the US imposed sanctions on Ukraine and Zelensky made a statement that can be seen as an apology, the agreement has regained its viability. Zelensky stated on Twitter, 'We truly value the support the US has provided to maintain Ukraine's sovereignty and independence.' He also expressed his willingness to sign the mineral agreement, saying, 'Ukraine is ready to sign the agreement in any form, and we see it as a step towards greater security and a more secure future.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 12:15 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/world/11255654)\n\n**New to Congress, Florida's Haridopolos leads debate on Artemis, moon and China**\nNew to Congress, Florida's Haridopolos leads debate on Artemis, moon and China. Haridopolos, who chairs the U.S. House Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, said, 'We stand at a crossroads. The world is watching, and our competitors, like communist China, are racing to beat us there.' Witnesses, including former NASA official Dan Dumbacher and former executive secretary of the National Space Council Scott Pace, agreed that the moon should be the focus, but called for a quick revision to the current Artemis plan. Dumbacher warned against shifting the focus to Mars, saying, 'It's about doing the right thing at the right time.' Pace suggested considering alternatives for going from the Earth to the moon and back, such as buying heavy-lift services instead of developing the expensive and non-reusable Space Launch System rocket. The current Artemis program has many critics, including Trump's close advisor and SpaceX founder Elon Musk. To date, only the uncrewed Artemis I mission has made it to space, with the much-delayed crewed Artemis II mission slated for no later than April 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 06:19 PM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3621635)\n\n**The New Era of Space Exploration: A Global Competition**\nThe space industry is no longer just a scientific frontier, but a pillar of global economic growth and security. The annual report on information security policy highlights the intense and strategic competition in space, with investments of billions of dollars, geopolitical challenges, and the rise of new actors. The report notes that the space industry is now a major driver of economic growth, with a market value of $570 billion in 2023, a 7.4% increase from the previous year. The US leads the way, with a spending of $73 billion, followed by China with $14 billion. The report also highlights the growing presence of private actors, such as SpaceX, which has launched 134 missions in 2024, more than all other launchers combined. The Starlink constellation, also developed by SpaceX, has nearly 7,000 satellites in orbit, making it the largest satellite network in the world. However, the report also notes the growing problem of space debris, with over 36,000 objects in orbit, including 10,000 active payloads. The report also discusses the new era of space exploration, with the Artemis program aiming to return humans to the Moon by 2027, and the International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) initiative, a joint project between Russia and China, aiming to establish a human presence on the Moon by 2035. \nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[Formiche.net](https://formiche.net/2025/03/corsa-alla-luna-la-sfida-arriva-da-mosca-e-pechino-lintelligence-fa-il-punto-sullo-spazio/)\n\n**Mariana Tragedy Agreement Reaches 17 Signatures**\nTwo new municipalities, Santa Cruz do Escalvado and Rio Doce, have joined the list of signatories to the Mariana tragedy agreement, bringing the total number of signatories to 17. Eight other cities have already sent the necessary documentation for signature. If confirmed, 23 of the 41 affected cities will join the agreement negotiated by governments and mining companies and approved by the STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) in November last year. The proposal provides for the direct distribution of R$ 6.1 billion to municipalities and payment over 20 years. Juliano Duarte, mayor of Mariana, the city most affected by the disaster, said he will not sign the agreement, questioning the values offered and the payment period. He will continue with the process in England, which is also the target of an action in the STF by the Ibram (Instituto Brasileiro de Minera\u00e7\u00e3o), which questions the legitimacy of Brazilian municipalities being parties to processes abroad. 'I will not sign the agreement, it's not worth it,' said Juliano Duarte. 'The values offered are not enough, and the payment period is too long.' \nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 12:08 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2025/03/duas-novas-prefeituras-optam-por-acordo-da-tragedia-de-mariana-no-brasil.shtml)\n\n**State Duma Approves Agreement to Postpone Payments Under Russian-Belarusian Intergovernmental Agreements**\nThe State Duma has approved a law to ratify an agreement to postpone payments under Russian-Belarusian intergovernmental agreements. The agreement, signed on April 25, and the protocol, signed on July 11, last year, provide for a payment delay. According to Deputy Minister of Finance of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Kolychev, 'The agreement and protocol were signed to reduce the payment burden on the budget of the Republic of Belarus in terms of paying off and servicing debt obligations to the Russian Federation in 2024.' Kolychev noted that the agreement and protocol were signed in accordance with the President of Russia's instruction on the President of Belarus's corresponding appeal. 'The agreements provide for the postponement of payments to pay off the principal debt from April 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024, and interest payments from July 1 to December 31, 2024, to the period 2031-2036. The total amount of payments to be postponed is approximately $800 million in dollar equivalent,' Kolychev clarified.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 10:50 AM\nSource:[\u041f\u0420\u0410\u0419\u041c](https://1prime.ru/20250304/gosduma-855452592.html)\n\n**New Taipei City Dual Recall: 12 Physical Signature Stations Announced**\nThe second stage of the dual recall of New Taipei City Councilor Zheng Zhengqian and suspended Mayor Gao Hong'an has begun, with 12 physical signature stations announced.

Lin Zhijie's service center was the first to open on March 5 from 6pm to 10pm, and he also encouraged volunteers to participate in the signature drive. According to leader Dai Zhenbo, the first stage of the proposal signature drive saw 70,000 signatures, with 7,000 for each of the two individuals. The second stage aims for 5,000 signatures each, totaling 10,000 signatures. The deadline for the second stage is April 6, and the organizers hope to complete the 10,000 signatures by mid-to-late April. 'We will not give up, we will not give in,' Dai Zhenbo said.

The organization is concerned about the potential destruction of over 90 important sites on the Moon, including the Tranquility Base (\u0411\u0430\u0437\u0430 \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f), where Neil Armstrong first stepped on the lunar surface. The WMF is a international non-profit organization that works to preserve cultural heritage around the world. They are concerned that scientific expeditions and space tourism may impact the state of the Moon's surface, including items left on the surface such as a golden olive branch and 125 miniature sculptures delivered by SpaceX. The WMF notes that international cooperation is necessary to protect the Moon, but the Artemis Accords, signed by over 50 countries in 2020, have limited impact due to the lack of signature from major space-faring nations such as the US, Russia, and China. Some experts argue that the threats to the Moon are not as pressing, as many scientific missions are directed away from previous landing sites, and space tourism does not currently impact these historic areas. 'It is a response to the growing interest in space travel and the problems associated with space debris,' said the WMF.

According to the UN, 400 million tons of plastic waste are produced annually, and this number is increasing. In March 2022, nearly 200 UN member states agreed to come up with concrete measures by the end of 2024. The negotiations have been ongoing for 10 years. The announcement follows the agreement on funding to combat biodiversity loss, which was reached in Rome last Thursday.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 12:05 AM\nSource:[Het Nieuwsblad](https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf20250304_00916680)\n\n**SpaceX Prepares for 8th Starship Rocket Test Flight: How to Watch**\nSpaceX is preparing for its eighth Starship rocket test flight, which will largely be a do-over of the seventh test flight that ended in a disintegration over the Caribbean. The company has made changes to the vehicle, including altering propellant temperatures and thrust levels, adding more vents to the attic section, and a system to purge the area of propellants. The flight aims to come to a less explosive conclusion. Starship will test a new system that shoots out dummy satellites, and will also try to catch its booster. The company is looking to improve the reliability of the rocket and plans to receive approval from the Federal Aviation Administration for up to 25 flights this year. NASA is planning to use a version of Starship to take astronauts to the moon during its Artemis III mission, currently scheduled for 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 09:58 PM\nSource:[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/03/science/spacex-starship-launch.html)\n\n**SpaceX receive the all clear to launch Starship's eighth test flight**\nSpaceX has received regulatory approval to launch the eighth test flight of its Starship rocket, which will target objectives not reached during its last trial. The flight will aim to deploy a payload of 10 mock-up Starlink internet satellites and splash down in the Indian Ocean. The company has made several hardware and operational changes to increase the reliability of the upper-stage, which failed to deploy the payload during the seventh flight test. The Starship rocket is designed to send astronauts to the Moon and beyond, and will play a key role in NASA's Artemis III mission in 2026. The launch is expected to last just over an hour and will be broadcast live on the official SpaceX website and ABC digital coverage.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 07:10 PM\nSource:[Australian Broadcasting Corporation](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-04/musk-spacex-starship-eighth-test-flight-explainer-live/104978862)\n\n**Artemis Agreement Signatories Commit To Continued Openness And Transparency In Space Endeavours - UrduPoint**\nThe signatories of the Artemis Agreements have reaffirmed their commitment to maintaining openness and transparency in their space-related activities and plans. The agreements, launched in 2020, aim to guide civil space exploration and its use in the 21st century. As of January 2025, 53 countries have signed the agreements, including the UAE, Australia, and the US. The signatories have agreed to focus on sustainability in 2025, particularly in areas such as debris mitigation and management of lunar surface and orbital debris. They have also proposed strengthening capacity-building workshops in specific regional areas to involve emerging space actors in discussions about safe and sustainable space operations. The signatories have committed to following the principles designed to promote safe, sustainable, and transparent space activities, including transparency in publishing information, national space policies and plans, and exchanging scientific data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 09:27 PM\nSource:[UrduPoint](https://www.urdupoint.com/en/middle-east/artemis-agreement-signatories-commit-to-conti-1923188.html)\n\n**Finland Joins 'Artemis Accords' as 53rd Country, Emphasizing International Cooperation in Space Research**\nFinland has become the 53rd country to join the 'Artemis Accords', a set of agreements that define best practices for safe and sustainable space research. Finland signed the accords on January 21, 2025, during the Winter Space Seminar 2025 at Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. 'Today, Finland joins the community of countries that want to freely exchange scientific data, work safely, and preserve the space environment for the Artemis generation,' said NASA Deputy Administrator Jim Freiday. Finnish Economy Minister Ville R\u00fcdman signed the agreement on behalf of Finland, saying, 'Our goal is for this cooperation to open up opportunities for the Finnish space sector in a new era of space research and the Artemis program.' The Finnish Ministry of Economic Affairs emphasized that by signing the non-binding agreement, the country continues to consider the UN as the primary forum for developing international space law and will comply with such laws in its space activities. Finland's accession follows a record 19 countries signing the Artemis Accords in 2024. NASA and the US State Department attribute the surge to growing recognition of the value of the accords as a forum for discussing space security and sustainability issues. The Artemis Accords were initiated in 2020 during the first Trump administration, when the US and seven other countries signed them. However, some industry representatives question whether the new Trump administration will maintain the same level of support for the accords, given its 'America First' philosophy. Experts are divided on the role of international cooperation, including the Artemis Accords, in the new Trump administration. While Lori Garver, former NASA Deputy Administrator under Obama, is skeptical about the accords' future, Scott Pace, Executive Secretary of the National Space Council in the first Trump administration, believes that international interaction will remain an important part of policy, as it is tied to broader national interests.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 04:06 PM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2025/01/22/finljandija-stala-53j-stranoj-v-kosmicheskom-klube-artemidy.html)\n\n**Finland signs on to Artemis Accords**\nFinland has become the 53rd nation to join NASA's Artemis Accords, a global agreement for responsible manned exploration of the moon.
