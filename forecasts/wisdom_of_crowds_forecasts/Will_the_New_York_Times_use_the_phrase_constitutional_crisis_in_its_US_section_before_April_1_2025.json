The Times has devoted multiple pages to vicious and personal attacks on Trump, calling him a liar, a fraudster, and lawless, and claiming that he seeks to destroy democracy and cause a constitutional crisis. The Times has also attacked Trump's relationship with Elon Musk, saying that Musk is a 'co-president' and that Trump seeks to transform the presidency and make it powerful. The Times has also criticized Trump's handling of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, saying that he did not keep his word and that Hamas called his bluff. Additionally, the Times has published a full-page ad from over 100 Rabbis, nearly all female, who oppose Trump's call for the removal of all Palestinians from Gaza, calling it 'ethnic cleansing'. The article concludes that the Times' attacks on Trump only strengthen his devotion to his followers and that the Times' strategy of driving a wedge between Trump and Musk is a sound one, knowing Trump's ego.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 05:53 AM\nSource:[timesofisrael.com](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-new-york-times-obsession-with-president-trump/)\n\n**Period for Filing Claims for NYC ICE Settlement Now Open**\nThe period for filing claims for a settlement payment as part of a collective lawsuit against the City of New York is now open and will run until May 15, 2025. The lawsuit, Onadia v. City of New York, was settled for up to $92.5 million and covers people who were illegally detained by the New York City Department of Correction (NYC) solely due to immigration detention requests from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) between April 1, 1997, and December 21, 2012. Over 20,000 people who were detained beyond their scheduled release dates may be eligible for a payment of $10,000 or more. The settlement allows people from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, Ecuador, Cuba, Colombia, Trinidad and Tobago, Honduras, and Guyana to file claims, regardless of their current residence in the United States. Matthew D. Brinckerhoff, a partner at Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP, said, 'Our Constitution protects all human beings within the United States against detention without probable cause, regardless of their immigration status. This case teaches that those protections must be respected and that those who choose to ignore the Constitution will be held responsible.' Debra L. Greenberger, a partner at Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward & Maazel LLP, added, 'We urge the media, community organizations, and individuals to share this information with anyone they know who may fit the description of a class member, so they can receive a settlement payment. The claims process is simple and can provide eligible class members with $10,000 or more.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 08:25 PM\nSource:[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/periodo-de-reclamaciones-ahora-abierto-para-personas-inmigrantes-de-mexico-y-otros-paises-que-fueron-ilegalmente-detenidas-en-carceles-de-nyc-por-ice-como-parte-de-un-acuerdo-de-demanda-colectiva-de-92-5-millones-de-dolares-contra-la-ciudad-871755996.html)\n\n**Editorial Roundup: United States**\nRecent editorials from The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal discuss the challenges facing the US under the Trump administration. The Washington Post argues that Trump's tariffs will not close the trade deficit, and that the trade deficit is a natural result of a country's current account deficit being financed by the rest of the world. The New York Times warns that Trump's actions are pushing the country towards a constitutional crisis, as he expands his executive authority and disregards the rule of law. The Wall Street Journal criticizes Trump's approach to peace talks in Ukraine, saying that it is a slap to NATO allies and that Europe needs to take responsibility for its own security. The Guardian argues that Ukraine should be included in deciding its own future, and that Trump's surrender to Russian aggression is a shock to Ukraine and its European allies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 08:13 PM\nSource:[myMotherLode.com](https://www.mymotherlode.com/news/national/us-government/3538392/editorial-roundup-united-states.html)\n\n**NYT Crossword: answers for Tuesday, February 18**\nThe New York Times has released the answers to today's crossword puzzle.

This statement has sparked fears of a constitutional crisis, with New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie calling it 'the single most un-American and anti-constitutional statement ever uttered by an American president.' Trump's administration has been aggressively dismantling federal agencies and disregarding court orders, with some officials actively defying rulings from federal courts. This is reminiscent of the shameful period in U.S. history when Southern governors refused to integrate their schools after the Supreme Court ruled against segregation. Law professor Frank Bowman warns that if Trump successfully defies the courts, the only remaining obstacle to dictatorship will be public revulsion and national popular protest.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:01 AM\nSource:[alaska-native-news.com](https://alaska-native-news.com/quoting-napoleon-trump-openly-declares-hes-above-the-law/77592/)\n\n**MAS calls for opposition unity to face constitutional reform and April elections in Venezuela**\nThe Venezuelan party Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) has called for unity among the opposition to face the constitutional reform promoted by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and to decide whether to participate in the April 27 legislative and regional elections, which have been rejected by the main anti-Chavista coalition, the Plataforma Unitaria Democr\u00e1tica (PUD). 'Is a national constitutional reform necessary when the country is immersed in a social, economic, and political crisis?', asked Mar\u00eda Verdeal, the national vice-president of MAS, in a statement, referring to the situation after Maduro's re-election, proclaimed by the electoral body -controlled by Chavismo- after the July 2024 presidential elections, which PUD considers 'fraudulent'. Verdeal urged the 'democratic leadership' to take 'firm steps' to 'achieve unity' and design a 'solid strategy' that -she assured- 'would prevent' Maduro 'from playing solo' and, according to her, 'impose a constitutional reform unilaterally that could destroy the concept of the State'. She warned that it is not public knowledge whether the reform project 'will be total or partial', while affirming that these changes are 'in the hands of a unilateral commission', designated by Maduro. The commission has 90 days to elaborate a definitive project of reform. On the April elections, Verdeal expressed her concern because the phases of the schedule for that vote are developed 'in parallel to this constitutional reform, which -she considered- must be submitted to a referendum for its approval'. 'The worst is that, amidst all this entanglement, the opposition is divided between participating or abstaining, while those in power advance significantly to establish a project for the country unilaterally', she indicated. The opposition leader assured that the MAS 'fears a paralysis or division of the democratic sectors of the country', and anticipated that the party will decide 'soon' whether to participate in those elections. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 01:55 AM\nSource:[espanol.news.yahoo.com](https://es-us.noticias.yahoo.com/mas-pide-unidad-opositora-reforma-015525270.html)\n\n**The New York Times to Begin Training Employees on AI Usage in 2025**\nThe New York Times has announced that it will begin training its employees to work with AI in 2025. The training will focus on using AI tools for tasks such as text editing, information summarization, programming, and content creation. The company has also introduced a new AI tool called Echo, which will help with summarizing articles, briefings, and other company activities. Employees have received updated editorial guidelines that describe how to use Echo and other AI tools. The guidelines encourage staff to use AI for suggestions on editing, revising content, creating summaries, writing social media posts, and creating SEO headlines. However, there are certain limitations. The company has emphasized that AI should not be used for writing or significantly altering articles, bypassing paywalls, using copyrighted materials, or publishing images and videos created with AI without clear labeling. It is unclear how many AI-edited materials will be published in articles. The company has previously stated that 'The Times' journalism is always created, written, and edited by our experienced journalists' and reaffirmed this approach several months later. In May 2024, the principles of using generative AI in the editorial department were approved, stating that 'Generative AI can help in certain parts of our process, but work must always be managed and remain under the responsibility of journalists.' The use of AI in the editorial department must begin with fact-checked information verified by journalists and undergo editorial review, just like any other material. Besides Echo, other AI tools such as GitHub Copilot for programming assistance, Google Vertex AI for product development, NotebookLM, ChatExplorer from The New York Times, API OpenAI (not ChatGPT), and some AI products from Amazon have been approved for use.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/companies/bothub/news/883358/)\n\n**Understanding presidential power in the age of Trump**\nNew York Times staff writer Charlie Savage discussed the scope and limits of executive power under President Donald Trump on FRESH AIR. Savage explained that the current situation is a constitutional crisis, with Trump openly breaking laws and disregarding court orders. He noted that the Supreme Court has been chipping away at Congress's ability to place limits on presidential authority, and that the current majority bloc on the court has been advancing the idea that presidents must have exclusive control over the executive branch. Savage also discussed the implications of Trump's actions on the federal bureaucracy, including the firing of federal employees and the purging of government agencies. He noted that Congress has the power to object to these removals, but that the current Republican Party is controlled by Trump and has been largely silent in defense of the laws that they passed. Savage also discussed the potential for Democrats to use the upcoming government funding deadline as leverage to push back against Trump's actions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 09:44 AM\nSource:[ksmu.org](https://www.ksmu.org/2025-02-17/understanding-presidential-power-in-the-age-of-trump)\n\n**Jen Psaki Warns Democrats Against \u2018Screaming\u2019 Constitutional Crisis \u2018From The Rooftops\u2019 to Oppose Trump**\nMSNBC anchor Jen Psaki advised Democrats against using the phrase 'Constitutional crisis' to criticize the Trump administration. Psaki stated, 'That is the potential for the constitutional crisis,' referring to the administration's apparent disregard for court orders. However, she cautioned against 'screaming from the rooftops' about it, instead suggesting that Democrats focus on how the administration's actions are impacting communities, such as farmers, Medicaid recipients, and veterans.

No Crisis\u200a -- \u200aIt's the Headlines that traffic in Crisis**\nNick Laudani argues that the New York Times (NYT) is fabricating a Constitutional Crisis by framing disputes between Trump and the courts as a crisis. Laudani claims that Trump is not the first President to defy or fight a lower court order and that he is not in contempt yet. He also points out that the NYT did not report a similar situation with the Obama administration, where the administration was in outright non-compliance with a court order. Laudani urges the NYT to exercise restraint and focus on the message rather than the messenger. He argues that the Democratic Party should focus on their policies and not be opposed to the other party. Laudani provides examples of the Obama administration's non-compliance with court orders, including the issuance of 108,000 three-year work permits to DACA applicants despite a court injunction. He concludes that the NYT's coverage is filling space in people's heads without focusing on the message for the Democrats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 07:02 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@Nick_Laudani/constitutional-crisis-no-crisis-its-the-headlines-that-traffic-in-crisis-070b902ac19a)\n\n**Jen Psaki Warns Democrats Against 'Screaming' Constitutional Crisis 'From The Rooftops' to Oppose Trump**\nMSNBC anchor Jen Psaki cautioned Democrats against using the phrase 'Constitutional crisis' to criticize the Trump administration. Psaki stated that Democrats should not 'scream' about a constitutional crisis 'from the rooftops' to oppose Trump. This warning comes after Democrats have criticized the administration for actions such as ignoring court orders and dropping corruption cases. Psaki's advice is aimed at preventing the perception of a constitutional crisis, which could be used to turn the public against the Trump administration. According to Psaki, Vice President JD Vance suggested that the administration should ignore court orders, stating that 'judges aren't allowed to control the executive branch's legitimate power.' Top DOJ prosecutors have also resigned after being ordered to drop a corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 09:42 PM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/tv/jen-psaki-warns-democrats-against-screaming-constitutional-crisis-from-the-rooftops-to-oppose-trump/)\n\n**Rachel Maddow Returns Back to Faking News Stories, and There Is a Crisis of Using 'Constitutional Crisis'**\nRachel Maddow has returned to her full week schedule and is back to fabricating news stories. Her latest expos\u00e9 claimed that Elon Musk was being paid off by Donald Trump with a $400 million order of armored Tesla vehicles, but she was caught out by the fact that the vehicle order was placed before Trump took office. Meanwhile, CBS News has not improved in quality since Norah O'Donnell left, with new co-host John Dickerson struggling to report on Trump's meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy to discuss the Russia-Ukraine War. The press has been critical of Trump's efforts to resolve the conflict, despite years of calling for an end to the war. Axios' Russ Contreras made a curious declaration that Joe Biden's border agents apprehended more illegal immigrants than Trump's agents, but Bill Melugin of Fox News corrected him, pointing out that Trump's enforcement has led to a significant decrease in illegal crossings. The outlet was called out for its slanted approach, and a communications officer admitted that the change in arrivals was noted, but the headline and framing were still misleading.

Nyhan's research team has found that political scientists are increasingly worried about the health of US democracy. The courts may intervene, but Trump's actions set a precedent that could allow him to act like a king. Nyhan worries that Trump may ignore the courts, as suggested by JD Vance, a former vice president. 'We're talking about the idea of whether the president has to follow the law at all,' Nyhan said.

The crisis has sparked a nationwide debate on the country's future direction and the role of the US-Korea alliance. Experts believe that South Korea is at a critical juncture in its future, and the outcome of this crisis will determine the country's path. The opposition party, led by Lee Jae-myung, has accused Yoon of violating the constitution and has called for his impeachment. Yoon's supporters, including many young people, have taken to the streets to protest the arrest and demand his release. The crisis has also highlighted the need for South Korea to strengthen its national defense and its alliance with the US. According to expert analysis, the crisis is not just a political struggle, but a battle over the country's future direction. The US is unlikely to intervene in South Korea's internal affairs, and the country's future is uncertain.

However, after studying journalism and working as a reporter, the author realized that the Times had a political agenda that disguised itself as journalism. As Noam Chomsky said, 'they determine, select, shape, control, and restrict to serve the interests of the dominant elite groups in society.' The New York Times has been criticized for its reporting on various issues, including its coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its handling of information. In December 2023, the Times published a report that claimed Hamas had decapitated babies during its invasion of Israel, but later concluded that the material was handled inappropriately. In April 2024, The Intercept revealed a memo from the NYT instructing its journalists to reduce or eliminate terms like 'genocide', 'ethnic cleansing', or 'occupied territory' in their coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The author argues that the Times is following a narrative that blames Mexico for the opioid crisis in the US, despite the fact that the crisis was caused by pharmaceutical companies and corruption in the US. The author also criticizes the Times for its coverage of the fentanilo crisis, including a report that showed a 'lab' in Culiac\u00e1n where the drug was being 'cooked', which the author believes is a fabrication. The president of Mexico, Sheinbaum, has challenged the Times and promised to demonstrate the dangers of producing fentanilo. The author concludes that the Times is following a narrative that is not supported by evidence and is instead serving the interests of the dominant elite groups in society. \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 02, 2025 06:09 AM\nSource:[El Heraldo de M\ufffdxico](https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/opinion/2025/1/2/fentanilo-news-665368.html)\n\n",
