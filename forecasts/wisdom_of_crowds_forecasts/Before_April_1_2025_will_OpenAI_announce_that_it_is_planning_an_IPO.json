Al Rumaih noted that the Saudi market became the fastest-growing worldwide in terms of the number of listed companies last year. He also mentioned that there are currently over 15 offerings awaiting approval and more than 50 applications under review by the Capital Market Authority (CMA). The IPO Management System has effectively contributed to boosting the coverage of offerings, reducing costs for companies, and shortening procedures by 50%, according to Al Rumaih. 'The market registered six new listings in January 2025, compared to only two listings in January 2024,' Al Rumaih said, highlighting the growth of the Saudi market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[english.mubasher.info](https://english.mubasher.info/news/4404887/Tadawul-expected-to-welcome-over-50-IPOs-in-2025-Al-Rumaih-at-CMF/)\n\n**Multiple Model Providers Announce Open-Source, Industry Sees a Paradigm Shift**\nRecently, several major model providers announced that they will open-source their large models, causing a stir in the industry. Baidu announced that its Wenxin Yinyan will be fully free from April 1, allowing users to experience its latest features on PC and APP platforms. On the same day, OpenAI also announced that its free version of ChatGPT will use GPT-5 without restrictions in standard intelligent settings. Additionally, Google's latest artificial intelligence model suite has been officially opened to all users. Gong Zheng, an engineer at the Technical and Standard Institute of the China Information and Communications Research Institute, stated that the rise of open-source models like DeepSeek, with their flexibility and low barriers to entry, is reshaping the industry ecosystem and forcing top players to break away from closed ecosystems. When open-source models can achieve 80% to 90% of the functionality of commercial models at 10% of the cost, the moat of closed systems naturally collapses, and free opening becomes a strategic choice to consolidate user loyalty. Gong Zheng pointed out that the maturity of AI technology is rewriting the business model. As OpenAI's founder predicted, the cost of using AI decreases by 10 times every 12 months, directly driving companies to convert technical advantages into market leadership. The maturity of technology and the pressure of the open-source ecosystem have prompted major model providers to join the free ranks. On the surface, free seems like 'losing money to make a name', but in reality, there are complex commercial logic. Gong Zheng believes that the technical advantages of top players have paved the way for free. Whether it's DeepSeek, Baidu, Ali, or OpenAI, when technology leaders can provide higher-performance services at lower costs, 'free' becomes a tool to consolidate market position.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 04:47 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250219/47989943.html)\n\n**Faraday Future to Boost AI Research and Development Efforts**\nFaraday Future, an electric vehicle company under Jia Yueting, has announced that it has started recruiting key positions to support its artificial intelligence (AI) plan.

The exchange and the Capital Market Authority are currently reviewing over 50 IPO applications, with around 100 more expected to be submitted in the coming period. Tadawul, which is the largest stock exchange in the Gulf region, with a daily trading value exceeding $1 billion, has seen a surge in IPOs in recent years, driven by the government's economic diversification strategies. According to Hisham Mustafa Gad, Head of Promotion and Coverage of Initial Public Offerings at EFH Bank, 'Given the excellent performance of recent initial public offerings in Saudi Arabia, confidence remains high, and the conditions are ripe for more.' The wave of initial public offerings in the Gulf is attributed to the region's governments' economic diversification strategies, as well as the listing of private and family-owned companies. Gad expects the private sector to dominate the number of IPOs, with some government-owned companies possibly listing as well. He notes that the healthcare, technology, and education sectors will play a significant role.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 06:34 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0642\u062a\u0635\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629](https://www.aleqt.com/2025/02/18/article_2757334.html)\n\n**OpenAI to Implement Protection Against Hostile Takeovers**\nOpenAI is considering a change in its organizational structure to attract more investments. Currently, the company is managed by a non-profit organization, which raises concerns among investors. OpenAI plans to shift towards a more standard commercial model, while ensuring that its board of directors has the power to protect the company from potential hostile takeovers. This decision is linked to Elon Musk's failed attempt to acquire the company for $97.4 billion. The transition to a commercial basis may weaken the company's defensive mechanisms, giving large shareholders like Microsoft or SoftBank more leverage. However, the board of directors, led by CEO Sam Altman, is developing special powers to counter this. Elon Musk, who left the company several years ago, has often criticized its current leadership for deviating from its original goals. His attempt to buy OpenAI was motivated by a desire to 'save' the company, but his commercial interests in AI cannot be ignored. In 2023, he founded his own startup xAI, which is also growing rapidly and attracting investor attention.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 02:59 PM\nSource:[overclockers.ru](https://overclockers.ru/blog/andr_83/show/209193/OpenAI-vnedrit-zaschitu-ot-vrazhdebnogo-pogloscheniya)\n\n**Reddit Supposedly Planning On Implementing Paywall For Certain Subreddits**\nReddit CEO Steve Huffman confirmed that the platform will introduce paywalls for certain subreddits by the end of 2025. The paywalls will allow communities to monetize their content through subscriptions, generating new revenue streams and providing users with more control over their platforms. This move comes after Reddit's API fee increase in 2023 and its application for an IPO last year. Reddit COO Jen Wong noted that the platform is also focusing on licensing deals with AI platforms, such as Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, which account for around 10% of its revenue. Reddit already offers a paid premium version, Reddit Premium, at $6.99 a month, which provides an ad-free experience and access to exclusive content.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 09:50 AM\nSource:[lowyat.net](https://www.lowyat.net/2025/342931/reddit-supposedly-planning-on-implementing-on-subreddit/)\n\n**Will 2025 finally mark the end of the IPO drought?**\nDespite a slow start to the year, Nasdaq president Nelson Griggs believes 2025 could be the year the IPO market makes a comeback. Griggs compared the IPO market to a pendulum, stating that after three years of limited capital raised in public markets, there's an enormous pipeline of companies waiting to go public. However, not all companies are eager to go public, with some, such as OpenAI, thriving in the private market and raising funds without launching an IPO. Griggs acknowledged that recent innovation in the private sector has allowed companies to access more liquidity, but emphasized that deep, sustained liquidity can only be achieved by going public. According to Griggs, signs that the incentive to go public is returning include improving yields and compressing valuation discounts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[nbcnewyork.com](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/business/money-report/will-2025-finally-mark-the-end-of-the-ipo-drought/6131588/)\n\n**Davos- Top NYSE exec sees robust US IPO activity in 2025**\nA strong US economy and lower interest rates could lead to a surge in initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025, according to Chris Taylor, vice president of listings and services at the New York Stock Exchange. Taylor said, 'There are certainly a lot of companies that are thinking about accessing public markets. Interest rates for the time being have stabilized. There's a lot of confidence trickling within the U.S. right now.' The change of guard at the Securities and Exchange Commission may also streamline the IPO process, potentially easing the burden for private companies. Heavyweights such as Genesys and Klarna are expected to go public in the US in the next few months. However, some high-profile startups like OpenAI and SpaceX have chosen to stay private, citing the costly and cumbersome paperwork associated with an IPO. Taylor expressed optimism about the new SEC regime, saying, 'We think (public markets) are the best place for price discovery, access to capital and universal access to investment. We're very hopeful that things will become more positive.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The new entity will build data centers and necessary infrastructure in Texas, aiming to increase productivity through automation. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, 'this will be the most important project of this era'. The project has its roots in the previous administration, with The Information revealing details in March 2024. Larry Ellison, Oracle's president, stated that 'construction on the data centers has already begun, and 10 facilities have been built so far'. He also hinted that the project could be related to digital health records and contribute to cancer treatment. Trump emphasized the magnitude of the investment, saying it represents 'a lot of money and high-quality people' and 'a clear declaration of confidence in the potential of the United States'.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 03:45 PM\nSource:[Iprofesional.com](https://www.iprofesional.com/tecnologia/421210-inversion-sin-precedentes-trump-impulsa-la-ia-con-un-plan-de-us-500-000-millones)\n\n**Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank Announce $500 Billion AI Investment Plan**\nOracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank have announced a $500 billion investment plan for artificial intelligence. The plan, called Stargate, aims to create a system of data centers for artificial intelligence. The project was announced at a press conference at the White House, attended by US President Donald Trump, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Oracle CTO Larry Ellison. According to Trump, the project will be facilitated by emergency orders. The executives announced that they plan to invest $100 billion in the first stage and up to $500 billion in the next four years. Trump emphasized that the goal is to 'keep it in this country.' Larry Ellison stated that the first joint venture of Stargate will be to build data centers in Texas. Ellison also mentioned that this effort is already underway. OpenAI announced in a tweet after the meeting that the project will not only support the re-industrialization of the US, but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of the US and its allies. Masayoshi Son will be the president of Stargate. Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Oracle, and OpenAI will be the key technology partners for the project. In a previous announcement, we mentioned that SoftBank's founder Masayoshi Son planned to invest $100 billion in his new venture focused on artificial intelligence chips in February 2024. Son also announced in December 2024 that he would invest $100 billion in the US over the next four years. Trump jokingly asked Son to increase his investment to $200 million during a visit to Trump's Florida home Mar-a-Lago. In response, Masayoshi Son mentioned this previous conversation and increased his investment to $500 billion in this new meeting. Trump stated in his statement: 'The $500 billion Stargate Project, which is in addition to the separate commitment of $100 to $200 billion from Masa, is coming.' Additionally, we note that Microsoft has updated its partnership with OpenAI. According to the updated agreement, Microsoft will have access to OpenAI's IP, revenue sharing arrangements, and restrictions on OpenAI's API will continue until 2030. However, the two companies have made a special arrangement for new capacity. Microsoft now has the first right to reject OpenAI's new capacity.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 22, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[webrazzi.com](https://webrazzi.com/2025/01/22/oracle-openai-ve-softbank-ten-500-milyar-dolarlik-yapay-zeka-yatirimi/)\n\n**Silicon Valley's largest start-ups to shun IPOs in 2025**\nSilicon Valley's largest start-ups, such as Databricks, SpaceX, and OpenAI, are opting to stay private for longer, despite having access to billions of dollars in new capital. This is due to the flexibility and freedom that comes with being a private company, allowing them to avoid the pressures of public markets. 'We are operating as a public company already,' said Databricks's chief Ali Ghodsi. The largest 15 to 20 start-ups have effectively had their IPOs as private companies, according to Mitchell Green, managing partner of Lead Edge Capital. Private companies are also dodging the scrutiny of public markets, which can be valuable in keeping valuations in check. However, some companies are being pushed onto public markets due to esoteric reasons, such as 'compounding IPO ratchets' or looming stock vesting dates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 05:04 AM\nSource:[Financial Times News](https://www.ft.com/content/b9d7b633-c611-4c09-b02e-5855dfaa0dfb)\n\n**OpenAI to become Public Benefit Corporation in 2025**\nOpenAI, a company known for its work in developing artificial intelligence, announced plans to become a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in 2025. This structural change aims to balance financial interests with a positive social impact, similar to other companies in the sector such as Anthropic and xAI. According to OpenAI, this transition will allow them to raise capital in more conventional conditions while maintaining their commitment to research and technological advancement. 'We will have to become something more than a laboratory and a startup: we will have to become a lasting company', said OpenAI. This approach will enable the organization to access the necessary resources to remain competitive in a highly demanding sector. The plan involves the non-profit division retaining shares in the new corporate structure, valued by independent financial advisors. However, this division will lose direct oversight of OpenAI's for-profit operations. Instead, the latter will assume management of 'operations and businesses', while the non-profit unit will focus on initiatives related to health, education, and science. 'Our plan would result in one of the best-resourced non-profit organizations in history', OpenAI stated in its press release. Although it was not specified whether CEO Sam Altman will receive stock participation, the reorganization aims to attract investors willing to support the development of large-scale artificial intelligence. The announcement comes at a time of tension for OpenAI, with a legal dispute with Elon Musk and a recent request by Meta to the California Attorney General to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit entity, citing potential risks to the sector. According to estimates, the for-profit division could reach a value of up to $150 billion, considering the previously estimated financial needs by OpenAI. In 2019, the organization calculated that at least $10 billion would be needed to develop general artificial intelligence; by October 2024, they had already raised $6 billion. OpenAI claims that the level of investment required to continue its mission exceeds their initial expectations. 'The hundreds of billions of dollars that large companies are currently investing in AI development show what will be needed for OpenAI to continue its mission', emphasized the company.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 07:00 PM\nSource:[pisapapeles.net](https://pisapapeles.net/openai-se-prepara-para-una-transformacion-como-corporacion-de-beneficio-publico-en-2025/)\n\n**OpenAI to Transition to Commercial Structure, Becoming Public Benefit Corporation**\nOpenAI has announced plans to transition to a commercial structure, becoming a 'Public Benefit Corporation' (PBC) in 2025. This structure will balance the interests of shareholders, stakeholders, and society. The non-profit organization will maintain a stake in the business but lose its oversight function. According to the company's blog, the PBC will be managed and controlled by a separate entity, while the non-profit organization will have its own management and staff. The non-profit organization will retain a share in the business, allowing it to become 'one of the wealthiest NGOs in the world' and implement charitable initiatives in healthcare, education, and science. OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, revealed the plans to several investors in the summer of 2024, as reported by The Information. The transition to a new management structure will allow the company to conduct an initial public offering (IPO), which some investors have been urging. OpenAI has a commercial structure, OpenAI Global, which was created in 2019 to attract capital. The non-profit organization's board of directors controls its work, and in 2023, they attempted to unilaterally fire Altman (he was later reinstated). In March 2024, Elon Musk, OpenAI's co-founder, filed a lawsuit against the company and other co-founders, alleging that they had neglected their obligation to work for the benefit of humanity and had effectively turned the project into a 'Microsoft subsidiary.' OpenAI asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that Musk had not provided agreements where the company promised to abandon monetization of its developments and had not cited provisions that prohibited the company from issuing licenses for its products and allowing third parties to occupy seats on the board of directors. Ultimately, Musk withdrew the lawsuit.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 04:50 PM\nSource:[vc.ru](https://vc.ru/chatgpt/1733860-openai-predstavila-plan-perehoda-k-kommercheskoi-strukture-upravleniya)\n\n**OpenAI to Become For-Profit Company in 2025**\nOpenAI announced a major transformation plan, aiming to become a for-profit company in 2025. The company will convert its existing non-profit department into a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) in Delaware, focusing on social impact. OpenAI will provide 'ordinary shares' and use part of the profits to further its mission, 'ensuring that general-purpose artificial intelligence (AGI) benefits all humanity.' The company's current structure has been criticized for being too restrictive, and the new plan aims to balance shareholder and stakeholder interests with public interest. OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman may receive up to 7% of the company's stock, potentially conflicting with his previous statement that accepting company stock could conflict with OpenAI's mission. The company has faced opposition from Meta and Elon Musk, who have raised concerns about the impact of the transformation on the tech industry. OpenAI has defended its plan, stating that it needs a more flexible business structure to fund AI research and development.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 28, 2024 09:44 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2024-12-28/doc-ineaziep4592375.shtml)\n\n**OpenAI's Plan to Become Profitable Includes Converting to a B Corp**\nOpenAI has announced plans to become a profitable company by 2025. The company will convert its profitable arm into a B Corp, a type of organization that balances the interests of its stakeholders with a positive impact on society. According to OpenAI, 'As we enter 2025, we will need to become more than just a lab and a startup - we will need to become a sustainable company', adding that many of its competitors are already registered as B Corps, including Anthropic and xAI owned by Elon Musk. '[This step] will allow us to raise the necessary capital on traditional terms like others in this field'. As part of the transition, the non-profit section of OpenAI will retain a stake in the profitable unit in the form of 'fairly valued shares determined by independent financial advisors', but will lose direct control over the company. OpenAI claims that 'our move will create one of the best non-profit organizations in terms of resources in history'. After reorganization, the profit-making section will be responsible for overseeing 'operations and business' of OpenAI, while the non-profit section will work separately with a special leadership team and focus on charitable efforts in healthcare, education, and science. It is unclear whether CEO Sam Altman will receive a share of the company as part of the reorganization. Last year, OpenAI's board of directors briefly removed Altman before reinstating him, sparking a corporate crisis that led to this week's announcement. According to some estimates, the value of OpenAI's profitable arm could reach $150 billion. In 2019, OpenAI estimated that it would need to raise at least $10 billion to build general artificial intelligence. In October, the company received $6 billion in new funding.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 07:18 PM\nSource:[alwafd.news](https://www.alwafd.news/5514148)\n\n**OpenAI Announces Plans to Restructure as For-Profit Company in 2025**\nOpenAI has announced plans to restructure itself as a for-profit company in 2025, which will allow it to attract more capital. However, the initiative is criticized and opposed by voices such as Elon Musk. OpenAI estimates that it needs more capital to pursue its mission of building a general artificial intelligence (AGI). The company plans to become a public benefit corporation (PBC), which will allow it to balance the interests of shareholders, stakeholders, and the public interest. This structure is becoming increasingly common in the industry, with companies such as xAI and Anthropic. OpenAI's restructure is also driven by its valuation of $157 billion, which it reached during its $6.6 billion funding round in October 2024. The company has two years to complete the conversion, or investors may demand their money back. OpenAI's efforts to restructure are met with obstacles, including a lawsuit from Elon Musk, who accuses the company of breaching its initial agreements. Musk has described the effort as a 'total scam' and claims that OpenAI is 'diabolical'. OpenAI has also faced an exodus of top talent, partly due to concerns that the company has prioritized commercial product development over safety. The company's technical director, Mira Murati, announced her departure in September 2024, followed by the research director, Bob McGrew, and vice-president of research, Barret Zoph. The company's CEO, Sam Altman, has stated that the departures are not related to the potential restructure. 'We're thinking about it, our board has been thinking about it for nearly a year, independently, thinking about what we need to do to move to the next step,' he said. 'These last few years, the culture and security processes have been relegated to second place compared to brilliant products,' said Jan Leike, OpenAI's former security director, upon his departure. OpenAI is also embroiled in numerous copyright infringement lawsuits filed by artists, actors, and media groups. 'This structure will allow us to raise the necessary capital in conventional conditions, like other players in the sector,' said OpenAI. 'This structure aims to generate profits while benefiting the public interest. The non-profit branch will take shares in the public benefit corporation,' added OpenAI, stating that this will allow it to best support its mission of making AGI benefit humanity as a whole.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 05:25 PM\nSource:[developpez.com](https://intelligence-artificielle.developpez.com/actu/366236/OpenAI-annonce-qu-il-amorce-sa-refonte-en-une-societe-a-but-lucratif-en-2025-et-que-cela-lui-permettra-d-attirer-plus-de-capitaux-mais-l-initiative-est-critiquee-et-combattue-par-des-voix-telles-qu-Elon-Musk/)\n\n**OpenAI says it needs 'more capital than we\u2019d imagined' as it lays out for-profit plan**\nOpenAI announced plans to transition to a for-profit structure in 2025, creating a public benefit corporation to oversee commercial operations.

According to OpenAI's board, the company needs 'more capital than we\u2019d imagined' to continue pursuing its mission, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars being invested in AI development by major companies.

The company, founded in 2015 with the goal of developing artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity, has been a non-profit organization. However, to improve AI models and create general artificial intelligence (AGI), OpenAI needs significant computational power and funding, which it has received through donations and investments, including a $14 billion investment from Microsoft. According to the plan, the for-profit part of the company will become a public benefit corporation, which will allow it to pursue profits while also achieving its original mission of creating AGI for the benefit of humanity. Elon Musk has criticized OpenAI and requested a temporary injunction to prevent the transition from a non-profit to a for-profit organization, but OpenAI has responded by pointing out that Musk had previously wanted to create a for-profit company.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 27, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[punto-informatico.it](https://www.punto-informatico.it/openai-diventera-public-benefic-corporation/)\n\n**Coreweave, Klarna may break IPO slump in 2025 - but OpenAI, SpaceX will wait it out**\nDealmakers expect a revival in initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025, with companies like CoreWeave and Klarna potentially going public.

Market sources told MarketWatch that these companies are not expected to go public despite interest in their high-profile names. Other large private companies, such as Circle, Netskope, and Synk Ltd., are also lining up for the IPO market. Despite healthier conditions for IPOs, investors still expect to see solid companies with longer track records than the startups that went public in years past.
