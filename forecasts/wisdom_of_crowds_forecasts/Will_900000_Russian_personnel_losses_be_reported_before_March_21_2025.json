        "description": "Since the beginning of the Russian invasion in 2022, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine releases their daily estimation of Russian losses in personnel, vehicles, aircraft, and other military equipment on their pages in social networks (see links in Resolution Criteria).\n\nOn February 19, 2025, they [reported](https://mod.gov.ua/en/news/the-estimated-combat-losses-of-russians-over-the-last-day-1-300-persons-175-ua-vs-and-72-artillery-systems) a total of 862,390 estimated casualties. At the same time the daily rate is being constantly above 1000 since July 25, 2024. With the pace of 1300 casualties per day the number of 900,000 casualties should be reached on March 20, 2025.\n\nHistorical data can be tracked by independent trackers\nsuch as [russian-casualties-in-ua](https://russian-casualties.in.ua/) , [Combat.FYI](https://combat.fyi/) and in the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/blob/main/data/russia_losses_personnel.json).",

This includes the case when the General Staff of the AFU stops publishing their data due to a ceasefire or peace agreement.",
        "fine_print": "* \"Personnel losses\" in this context are *killed and wounded* soldiers and that wounded soldiers may return to the battlefield later.\n* In the past there was at least one occasion on [May 27, 2023](https://www.facebook.com/GeneralStaff.ua/posts/594141432898939?ref=embed_post) when the error in the previous day's report was admitted and corrected. For this reason, the question will resolve two days later than any published report, although it will retroactively close before the date the report was first published.\n* Historical trackers mentioned in the Background information ([russian-casualties-in-ua](https://russian-casualties.in.ua/), [Combat.FYI](https://combat.fyi/) and the [2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset](https://github.com/PetroIvaniuk/2022-Ukraine-Russia-War-Dataset/blob/main/data/russia_losses_personnel.json)) may be used as secondary resolution sources if the main resolution pages are banned/unavailable.",

According to the Ministry, '... despite the launch of the so-called 'new contract 18-24' by the Kiev regime on February 11 of this year to attract Ukrainian youth on a voluntary basis to the ranks of the VSU, it is not possible to recruit even a few thousand 'volunteers'...' The Ministry also notes that in January 2025, around 28,000 people were mobilized through the TCC, while the total losses of Ukrainian servicemen reached 51,960. In December 2024, mobilization affected around 33,000 people, with losses of 48,470 Ukrainian servicemen. In November, around 34,000 people were mobilized, with losses of 60,805 Ukrainian servicemen. Since the start of the special military operation, the Ukrainian military has suffered losses of around 1.08 million people, including killed and wounded, with over 60,000 of these losses occurring in the Kursk region.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 01, 2025 03:27 PM\nSource:[URA.RU](https://ura.news/news/1052896407)\n\n**Russia Loses Record Number of Vehicles in February**\nIn February, Ukraine's military damaged or destroyed a record number of Russian vehicles, including 3,472 units of automotive transport and tankers, and 596 armored vehicles. According to the Ministry of Defense, this is the highest number of vehicles destroyed in a single month since the start of the war. Additionally, 3,274 combat encounters took place in February, down from 5,087 in January. The number of Russian airstrikes on Ukrainian positions and rear cities also increased. The Russian tactical aviation dropped over 3,522 kamikaze drones (KABo) in February, up from 2,400 in January. Furthermore, 331 enemy tanks were destroyed or put out of commission, the highest number in the past seven months. Ukrainian forces also destroyed and damaged 1,415 enemy artillery systems, enough to equip over 78 artillery divisions. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces reported that the Russian army suffered significant irrecoverable and sanitary losses in February, with 36,570 personnel casualties. This is the highest number of personnel losses since December 2024, when 48,670 losses were reported. The Russian occupation forces have been buying donkeys to transport ammunition and equipment due to high losses of automotive equipment.

The report notes that the quality of Russian forces has significantly decreased, with many new recruits receiving minimal training and the command using a 'quantity over quality' approach, sacrificing lives for progress. Russia is compensating for its losses in equipment by drawing on its Soviet-era stockpiles of tanks and armored vehicles. The report also notes that, despite the significant losses, the Russian army continues to launch attacks due to its numerical superiority and the willingness of the Kremlin's leadership to accept losses.

In total, Russia has lost around 14,000 MBTs, IFVs, and APCs since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Despite these staggering numbers, Russia has been able to recover some of these losses by relying on Soviet-era equipment. However, the equipment that remains in storage is likely to be in a worn-out state, which could hinder Russia's ability to provide sufficient equipment to compensate for the losses. The IISS report notes that by the end of 2024, the number of active Russian equipment had only reached the level of February 2022, and the significant expansion of units has exacerbated the shortage of equipment. The main problem facing Russia is the lack of IFVs and APCs, even at higher production rates. However, Russia has adapted its tactics to mitigate these problems by relying on temporary measures and further infantry attacks, according to the IISS. The report estimates that by the start of January 2025, at least 172,000 Russian soldiers had been killed and 611,000 wounded, with at least 376,000 suffering severe injuries (invalids), and a total of 235,000 wounded but recoverable. The Russian mobilization, including forced mobilization in occupied Donbas, mobilization in 2022, and the prisoner recruitment, has allowed for the formation of around 976,000 personnel for participation in the war. Therefore, according to the IISS, by the end of December 2024, there will be around 617,000 personnel deployed in Ukraine or nearby, including wounded recoverable personnel and those undergoing training. 'Although Russian forces are likely to degrade in the coming months, they are sufficiently restored and adapted to support offensive operations for at least another year. However, this will come at a great cost in terms of equipment and personnel losses,' the report states.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/rus/news/rosiya-zaznala-prigolomshlivih-vtrat-fronti-1739364942.html)\n\n**Russia's Losses in January 2025: Over 48,000 Personnel**\nAccording to British intelligence, Russia likely suffered its second-largest personnel losses in January 2025, after December 2024.

The total losses of Russian forces since the start of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine have exceeded 750,000 people. The report notes that Russian losses have been increasing for six consecutive months, peaking in December with 48,670 casualties, the highest number since the start of the war. The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces estimates that as of January 15, the total losses of Russians are around 812,670 people. The Pentagon estimated Russian losses at 600,000 in October 2024. The report also mentions the pressure on the centre of the Donetsk region, particularly the city of Velika Novosilka, with Russian forces advancing in the north of the region after capturing Ugledar in October 2024 and Kurakhovo in early January 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 19, 2025 05:30 PM\nSource:[hvylya.net](https://war.hvylya.net/305788-britanskaya-razvedka-ocenila-poteri-rossii-v-2024-godu)\n\n**Russia's Losses Reach 804,930 Personnel, General Staff Reports**\nAccording to the General Staff, Russia has lost approximately 804,930 personnel.

Given the starting point of 862,390 casualties reported on February 19, 2025, and a daily increase of approximately 1300 losses, we can calculate the expected number of days until the 900,000 mark is reached. To calculate this, we start with a gap of 37,610 casualties to reach 900,000. At 1300 losses per day, this gap would be closed in approximately 29 days. Therefore, by March 20, 2025, the 900,000 figure is expected to be reached, according to these reports. Given this quantitative base, combined with the consistent reporting pattern, the initial probability of reaching 900,000 by the specified date is quite high.",
