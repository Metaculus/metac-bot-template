After Dan Hooker withdrew from their scheduled fight, Gamrot attempted to replace him, but ultimately, Gaethje will face Rafael Fiziev instead. Gaethje stated that he didn't consider Gamrot as an option, saying 'I didn't hear about Gamrot. I think the UFC didn't consider him. It's a completely different fight.' Gaethje also mentioned that he trusted his manager and coaches to make the decision on his next opponent. He stated that his top choices were Tsaruykan and Oliveira, and that beating either of them would give him a chance to fight for the title against Makhachev.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: March 03, 2025 09:04 AM\nSource:[sportowefakty.wp.pl](https://sportowefakty.wp.pl/mma/1175848/justin-gaethje-wypowiedzial-sie-na-temat-gamrota-i-zamieszania-przed-ufc-313)\n\n**UFC 313: Ankalaev vs Pereira, Gaethje vs Fiziev, and More Exciting Matches**\nThe upcoming UFC 313 tournament is expected to be a highlight of the week, with several exciting matches and title fights.
