They praise its 'goddamn high' bar for visual effects, saying it 'pushes us forward into the next level.' However, they predict that Dune: Part Two will win due to its name recognition and multiple award nominations.

The lead actress award went to Michelle 'Micky' Madison for 'ANORA Anora', not Demi Moore for 'Substance', which was considered a favorite to win.

We rank the Oscar field**\nThe Oscar race for best picture is heating up, with 'Anora' currently the frontrunner thanks to wins at the Producers Guild and Directors Guild. However, no lead is ironclad, and several films still have a chance to win. The nominees are ranked from least likely to win to most likely to win, with 'Anora' at the top. The film, directed by Sean Baker, has been a critical and commercial success, and its wins at the PGA and DGA Awards have reestablished it as the movie to beat. However, other films, such as 'Conclave' and 'A Complete Unknown', are still in the running and could potentially pull off an upset. 'Anora' is a sly and devastating twist on a 'Pretty Woman'-like fable, and its connection to Hollywood's celebrated '70s and indie filmmaking present make it a strong contender. 'Conclave', directed by Edward Berger, is a universally respected nominee, but it needs a victory at the BAFTAs to stay in the running. 'A Complete Unknown', directed by James Mangold, has momentum and could propel Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet to best actor. 'The Brutalist', directed by Brady Corbet, is a visionary and ambitious film, but its length may be a turn-off for some voters. 'Wicked', directed by Jon M. Chu, is a Big Studio Movie contender, but it's missing some key ingredients for pulling out best picture. 'Emilia P\u00e9rez', directed by Jacques Audiard, has been in freefall since its star became ensnared in a scandal, but it's still a contender in other categories. 'I'm Still Here', directed by Walter Salles, is a testament to the film's appeal, and 'The Substance', directed by Coralie Fargeat, has turned out to be a more Oscar contender than initially believed. 'Dune: Part Two', directed by Denis Villeneuve, hasn't been the same awards force as its predecessor, and 'Nickel Boys', directed by RaMell Ross, is a thrillingly shot film that's glad to be counted among the best of the year. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 02:20 PM\nSource:[pottsmerc.com](https://www.pottsmerc.com/2025/02/15/oscar-best-picture-ranking/)\n\n**Opinion: This year\u2019s Oscar nominations will leave you questioning Hollywood\u2019s taste**\nThe author shares their opinions on the 2025 Oscar nominations, highlighting their favorite and least favorite films.

Producer Chris Miller expressed his disappointment, saying, 'What Denis did was mastery in every aspect of the craft.' Josh Brolin also supported Villeneuve, saying, 'You deserve it, Joe Walker and Denis.' Brolin had previously threatened to quit acting if he wasn't nominated for an Oscar, saying, 'If I'm not nominated this year, I'll quit acting.'

The film's exclusion is attributed to a combination of factors, including recency bias and the Academy's bias against science fiction films. Initially, the film was set to be released in November 2023, but the SAG AFTRA strikes forced the release to be moved to March 2024, crippling any viable awards campaign. If it had been released in November 2023, Dune: Part Two would likely have been a major frontrunner for Best Picture and Villeneuve would have posed a serious challenge to Christopher Nolan for Best Director. The case of Villeneuve's snub highlights the drawbacks of an awards show that has become more of a campaign than a celebration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 25, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[Collider](https://collider.com/denis-villeneuve-dune-2-oscar-snub/)\n\n**All the 2025 best picture Oscar nominees, ranked from worst to best**\nThe 2025 best picture Oscar nominees have been announced, and writer-director Sean Baker's 'Anora' is a standout. The film brings the classic screwball movie setup to the 21st century, following an exotic dancer who falls for the son of a Russian oligarch. Meanwhile, 'Dune: Part Two' is a visually stunning epic that deserves recognition for its investment in costumes, sets, and storytelling. Director Denis Villeneuve has packed every frame with care, craft, and thought-provoking questions about humanity's faith in false messiahs.

The film explores themes of destiny and betrayal as Paul Atreides (Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet) rises to power on the desert planet Arrakis. Chalamet shared his excitement about returning to the franchise, saying, 'I've never worked on a part two of something before. I've never colored in the first 40 or 50 percent of a character's story and then gotten a chance to go back to it. So it was thrilling, it was joyful to be back with old friends and old cast mates.' Villeneuve plans to adapt the third installment, 'Dune: Messiah', and believes it has the potential for a 'very strong movie'.

Jarin Blaschke's moody and atmospheric visuals in 'Nosferatu' earned him a nomination, while Greig Fraser's work in 'Dune: Part Two' builds upon the aesthetic foundation of its predecessor and has achieved a historic feat as no sequel to a film that previously won an Academy Award cinematography has ever been nominated in the category.

This achievement is unique because it is based on the same novel, 'Dune', by Frank Herbert, and is not a sequel in the classical sense. The film is an adaptation of the rest of the first novel, and its nomination is a testament to the enduring popularity of the story.

The film's absence from the nominees list may cause problems for Villeneuve in the 2025 Oscars, as the DGA has historically been a strong indicator of Oscar nominations, especially for Best Director. According to history, only eight times has the DGA's Feature Film winner not won an Oscar, and only once has a filmmaker without a DGA nomination won the Oscar for Best Director.

The highly anticipated sequel, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, Rebecca Fergusson, and Javier Bardem, follows the events of the first film, with Paul Atreides and Lady Jessica having arrived with the fremen to win their sympathy. However, this second installment addresses the identity of Atreides, who is divided between revenge and feelings, and must choose between his true love and the destiny of the universe. The film is intense, with great action and adventure scenes, but also room for romance. Visually, it is dazzling and narratively epic, with almost three hours of a spectacular science fiction space show that can captivate the entire audience. Dune 2 will arrive at the 2025 Oscars with controversy, as it used important musical pieces from the previous film, which is against the Academy's rules. According to the rules, no more than 20% of existing themes from the franchise can be used. Dune: Part Two was released in March 2024, grossed over $714 million at the box office, received even better reviews than the previous film, and was available on streaming just a few months later.

The film has already secured three shortlisted nominations for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and is expected to be a major contender at the 2025 Oscars. However, Hans Zimmer's score for the film is ineligible for submission due to a controversial rule from The Academy, which states that the score contains too much sampling from the original film. According to Zimmer, 'Dune: Part One and Dune: Part Two are one story, so it would make no sense for me to go and change the theme for the characters.'

Emilia P\u00e9rez, a musical-crime film directed by Jacques Audiard, has been gaining momentum with 10 Critics Choice Awards nominations and 8 Golden Globe nominations. Its success at Cannes, where it won three awards, including a special mention for its lead actresses, makes it a strong contender for a surprise win. Inside Out 2, a sequel to the animated film, is also a favorite to win Best Animated Feature, and could be nominated in other categories as well. Dune: Part Two, the sequel to the 2021 film, is expected to repeat its predecessor's success, with 10 Critics Choice nominations and 2 Golden Globe nominations. Maria, a biographical film about Maria Callas, directed by Pablo Larra\u00edn, has received praise for Angelina Jolie's performance, which could earn her a second Oscar nomination. The film's costume design is also a strong contender for an award. The rise of streaming platforms has changed the way voters access films, making it more democratic but also raising questions about the impact of films when viewed outside of the immersive cinematic experience.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 21, 2024 12:38 AM\nSource:[nuevamujer.com](https://www.nuevamujer.com/espectaculos/2024/12/21/filtran-lista-preliminar-de-los-premios-oscar-y-estas-peliculas-podrian-arrasar-de-forma-inesperada/)\n\n",
