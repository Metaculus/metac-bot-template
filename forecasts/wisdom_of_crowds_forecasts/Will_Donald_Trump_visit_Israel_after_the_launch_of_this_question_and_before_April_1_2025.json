His visit comes after President Donald Trump's proposal to relocate Gazans out of the Gaza Strip, which was widely criticized by European and Arab states. Rubio agreed with Trump that the Gazans should be relocated, saying Gaza is 'not habitable' due to dangers from unexploded ordinance. He also tweeted, 'Gaza MUST BE FREE from Hamas.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu voiced support for the idea, saying 'what's wrong with allowing Gazans who want to leave to leave, they can come back and relocate and come back.' Rubio defended Trump's plan as a 'very generous' humanitarian initiative to aid in debris removal and reconstruction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 03:58 PM\nSource:[americanisraelite.com](https://americanisraelite.com/rubio-to-visit-middle-east-in-wake-of-trump-relocation-proposal/)\n\n**Iran Threatens to Rebuild Facilities in Case of Nuclear Attack**\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said, 'If they want to attack our Natanz nuclear facility, let them come and attack it. It was the brains of our children who built it.' He made this statement during a visit to the province of Buchehr, in southern Iran. Pezeshkian added, 'If they destroy a hundred [nuclear facilities], our children will build a thousand.' This statement comes after reports from The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal, citing US intelligence sources, that Israel is likely to attack Iran's nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz in the first half of 2025. Israel has previously attacked Iranian targets, including a military facility in October 2024, in response to a missile attack by Iran. Analysts believe that Israel may launch a larger-scale operation against Iran. Iran denies that its facilities were severely damaged in the previous attack. US President Donald Trump has reintroduced his policy of 'maximum pressure' on Iran, citing concerns that the country is trying to produce nuclear weapons. Trump said, 'I would like to see a nuclear agreement with Iran. I prefer to do that rather than bombing it.' He added, 'If we conclude the agreement, Israel will not bomb it.' Iran denies that it is trying to acquire nuclear weapons.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 03:18 PM\nSource:[Not\u00edcias ao Minuto](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/2727552/irao-diz-que-reconstruira-instalacoes-em-caso-de-ataque-nuclear)\n\n**Politics | Feb 15th 2025 Edition**\nDonald Trump held a 90-minute phone call with Vladimir Putin, announcing that he would 'immediately' start negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine.

The US has prepared a second report, issued in the early days of Donald Trump's presidency, re-examining the possibility of such strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities.

According to the US State Department, Rubio will meet with high-ranking officials to promote regional cooperation, stability, and peace. The trip will focus on the release of American and other hostages and the advancement of a second phase of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. Rubio's visit comes after US President Donald Trump proposed taking control of the Gaza Strip and relocating Palestinians. Trump said his plan for rebuilding Gaza does not imply that refugees can return to their homeland, but rather 'building a permanent place of residence' for them. The plan has been met with criticism from Hamas, which called Trump's statements 'racism' and a 'call for ethnic cleansing.' Hamas has delayed the release of hostages, accusing Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement. Trump has also suggested relocating 1.5 million Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan, which has been rejected by both countries. The situation in Gaza has been tense since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a rocket attack on Israel, prompting Israeli retaliation.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 03:25 AM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1838458/2025-02-13/v-gosdepe-ssa-soobsili-o-predstoasem-vizite-rubio-na-bliznii-vostok)\n\n**Israel Plans to Strike Iranian Nuclear Facilities in 2025, WSJ Reports**\nAccording to US intelligence, Israel plans to launch 'significant' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in 2025, with the expectation of US support, reports WSJ. Trump stated that he would prefer a non-nuclear deal with Iran over airstrikes. US intelligence has assessed that Israel is considering a 'significant' strike on Iranian nuclear facilities this year, sources familiar with the report told The Wall Street Journal. The analysis of intelligence data shows that Israel will push the Trump administration to support the strikes, believing that Trump is more likely to join the attack than Biden and fearing that the opportunity to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons is closing, said two people familiar with the intelligence. 'The US military officials told WSJ that Israel would likely need US military support and ammunition to strike 'well-protected' Iranian nuclear facilities. The Israeli government did not respond to WSJ's request for comment, and Israeli military officials declined to comment on the matter. Trump signed an executive order on January 31 to revive the 'maximum pressure' policy on Iran, which he implemented during his first term. The strategy aims to reduce Iran's oil export revenue and prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. Trump stated that he is not enthusiastic about this step and would prefer a confirmed nuclear peace agreement. He called the claims that the US and Israel are planning to 'destroy Iran' 'greatly exaggerated.' 'I would have preferred to make a non-nuclear deal with Iran. I would have preferred that to bombing it,' Trump emphasized. Before his inauguration, he suggested the possibility of a US-Iran war. WSJ previously reported that Israel was considering a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in October in response to a rocket attack on October 1, 2024. Iran retaliated with attacks in response to Israeli strikes that killed leaders of the Lebanese group Hezbollah and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas. On October 26, Israel launched a retaliatory strike on Iranian military targets. Iran reported 'limited damage.' Axios reported that Israel attacked an object where nuclear weapons equipment was located. In December, Israeli media reported that the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) believed that after the weakening of Iranian-backed groups in the Middle East and the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, there was an opportunity to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Iran has accelerated uranium enrichment to 60% and may approach 90%, necessary for creating nuclear weapons.

Before the visit, Rubio will attend a security conference in Munich and a meeting of G7 ministers. Previously, US President Donald Trump announced plans to take control of the Gaza Strip, promising responsible involvement in its reconstruction. Trump expressed ambitions to make it a tourist destination, comparing it to a Middle Eastern Riviera. He described the current state of the Gaza Strip as irreparable, suggesting that its residents relocate to countries like Jordan or Egypt. Trump also did not rule out the possibility of sending US armed forces to the region and plans to visit the Gaza Strip personally. 'It is a testament to the hard work of our diplomats and the dedication of our allies,' Rubio said, 'that we are able to engage in these critical discussions.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 12:44 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/gosdep-ssha--marko-rubio-posetit-izrail-i-saudovskuyu-araviyu-563119.html)\n\n**Diaa Rashwan Responds to the Attack on King Abdullah Following the Trump Meeting**\nDr. Diaa Rashwan, head of the General Authority for Information, said that US President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which was his first meeting with a foreign leader during his 6-day visit to Washington. King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to visit the White House during a time of tension in the region, following Trump's proposal to deport Palestinians from Gaza. Rashwan stated, 'It was natural to have a case of lack of scrutiny and sometimes memory loss, and we saw the comments that we saw at first glance regarding the comments on Trump's statements and the Jordanian monarch's statements.' He continued, 'After that, we all saw the tweets of King Abdullah and all the Jordanian officials, which all point to one line. On October 18, 2023, King Abdullah called for a quadrilateral summit in Amman to be attended by US President Joe Biden, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. However, before that, a hospital was bombed, so the Jordanian monarch, the Egyptian president, and the Palestinian president coordinated and canceled the meeting with Biden, who then visited Israel. The summit did not take place.' Rashwan emphasized, 'Therefore, the attack on King Abdullah reflects a case of memory loss and one of the flaws of social media, as social media is a child of the moment, a child of the ivy league, and not a child of the truth.' He stressed that deportation is a threat to Egyptian national security and the Palestinian issue, and the presence of 4 million Palestinian refugees in Jordan, where there is a high percentage of Jordanian tribes and clans of Palestinian origin.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 12:01 AM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0648](https://www.vetogate.com/5347661)\n\n**Diaa Rashwan Comments on the Meeting between the Jordanian Monarch and Donald Trump**\nJournalist Diaa Rashwan stated that US President Donald Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, marking the first time a foreign leader has met with him during his 6-day visit to Washington.

Trump expressed his love for Israel and described the Middle East as 'an incredible place, so vibrant.' However, he also made controversial remarks, stating that the US will 'take over' the Gaza Strip and suggesting a permanent resettlement of Palestinians outside Gaza. Trump's comments came during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was visiting the White House amid a fragile ceasefire in Gaza.

Netanyahu arrived in the US yesterday and met with Trump's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, after which he announced that an Israeli delegation would travel to Qatar 'at the end of the week' to continue negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire agreement with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Trump and Netanyahu have shown significant political convergence since Trump's first term, with Netanyahu stating before leaving Israel that 'working closely' with Trump would allow them to 'further redraw' the Middle East map. However, Trump's proposal to transfer the inhabitants of the Gaza Strip, over two million people, to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, has sparked international outrage. Trump admitted yesterday that he has 'no guarantee' that the ceasefire in Gaza will last, while his envoy Witkoff expressed optimism, saying 'we hope to reach a peaceful solution to this'. Meanwhile, the Israeli army continues to attack the Jenin area in the occupied West Bank as part of a large-scale operation launched on January 21. When asked if he would support Israel's annexation of Palestinian territories, Trump refused to answer, simply noting that Israel is 'a very small country in terms of territory'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 11:19 AM\nSource:[tpi.it](https://www.tpi.it/esteri/usa-israele-trump-riceve-premier-benjamin-netanyahu-primo-leader-straniero-casa-bianca-202502041161074/)\n\n**Netanyahu to Discuss Iran, Gaza, and Saudi Relations with Trump**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with US President Donald Trump on February 2, 2025, in a visit that is expected to shape the US's Middle East policy. The meeting will focus on several key issues, including the Iranian threat and possible ways to address it. Netanyahu plans to discuss with Trump the possibility of imposing stricter sanctions on Iran and engaging in diplomatic dialogue with Tehran. Israel expects Trump to clarify his stance on the matter, including the possibility of a military option. The situation around Iran is also linked to the prospects of normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. US Special Envoy for the Middle East Stephen Witkoff has already met with the Saudi leadership, which may indicate the US's intention to promote the expansion of the 'Abraham Accords'. Another important topic of discussion will be the fate of hostages and the future of the Gaza Strip. Israel recognizes that the Gaza issue will not be resolved in the near future, despite the 19-day deadline for the second stage of the hostage exchange negotiations. Netanyahu and Trump will discuss ways to optimally address these challenges. Israel has also expressed surprise at Trump's statement about the possible 'relocation of Gaza', which has never been seriously considered in Jerusalem. It is unclear whether Trump genuinely believes that relocating large numbers of Gaza residents to Egypt and Jordan is a realistic option. The Trump administration plans to discuss further steps towards normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia during Netanyahu's visit. However, even the current fragile ceasefire may not be enough, as Israel has expressed doubts about whether a normalization agreement can be reached before the end of the current hostage exchange negotiations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 08:18 PM\nSource:[vesty.co.il](https://www.vesty.co.il/main/article/rj2xiikd1e)\n\n**This is the first foreign leader who will be meeting Donald Trump at the White House**\nUS President Donald Trump is set to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on February 4, 2025, making him the first foreign leader to visit during Trump's second term.

The meeting follows a recent ceasefire in Gaza, which Netanyahu strategically delayed until before Trump's inauguration. Trump has already shown support for Israel by lifting restrictions on military aid, including approving the transfer of 2,000 pound bombs. The visit comes amidst multiple legal challenges for Netanyahu, including bribery and breach of trust allegations. Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have defended Israel's actions and condemned the ICC warrant.

Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan temporarily accept Palestinians from Gaza, saying 'we need to clean it up thoroughly.' However, this proposal has been rejected by Egypt, Jordan, and the Palestinian side. The US Congress has attempted to pass a bill to sanction the International Criminal Court (ICC) due to its issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The bill, known as the 'Illegitimate Court Counteraction Act,' would impose sanctions on foreign individuals who investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute US citizens or citizens of US allies, including Israel. The bill passed in the House of Representatives but failed to pass in the Senate due to a lack of votes. Despite this, the US is not a signatory to the ICC's Rome Statute and is not bound by its provisions.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 03:25 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/zh/%E5%86%85%E5%A1%94%E5%B0%BC%E4%BA%9A%E8%83%A1%E5%B0%86%E6%88%90%E4%B8%BA%E7%89%B9%E6%9C%97%E6%99%AE%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E4%BB%BB%E6%9C%9F%E9%A6%96%E4%BD%8D%E8%AE%BF%E7%BE%8E%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%96%E5%9B%BD%E9%A2%86%E5%AF%BC%E4%BA%BA/a-71449099)\n\n**Israel\u2019s Netanyahu invited to meet Trump at White House next week**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet US President Donald Trump at the White House next week.

This will be the first visit to the White House by a foreign leader during Trump's second term. Trump mentioned the visit on Air Force One, saying that Netanyahu will 'arrive soon' to meet with him, but did not disclose the exact date. The meeting comes at a time when a six-week ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is in effect. Trump claimed that he was the key to brokering this agreement, saying on his social media platform Truth Social that it was a 'historic' agreement that only came to fruition because he won the US presidential election in November last year. Trump previously proposed relocating Gaza residents to neighboring Egypt and Jordan, but this proposal was strongly rejected by Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, as well as the Egyptian and Jordanian governments. Despite this, right-wing hardliners within the Israeli government have long advocated for encouraging Gaza residents to move to neighboring countries. The ceasefire agreement has temporarily ended the war that began on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on Israel, resulting in the deaths of over 1,200 Israelis and the kidnapping of 251 people who were later released. Israel's military retaliation led to significant casualties, with over 47,200 Palestinians, mostly civilians, killed in the conflict, according to data from the Hamas-managed health department in Gaza.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 12:58 AM\nSource:[ETtoday\u65b0\u805e\u96f2](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20250129/2900435.htm)\n\n**Trump Invites Netanyahu to White House Visit**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been invited by US President Donald Trump to visit the White House on February 4, 2025, marking the first visit by a foreign prime minister to Washington during Trump's second term.

According to Israeli reports, Wietkof's visit comes as preparations are underway and preliminary negotiations are being held for the second phase of the prisoner release agreement, which is set to begin on the 16th day of the agreement, coinciding with next Tuesday. In a related context, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he will visit Washington next week to meet with Trump, 'in the first meeting between the US President and a foreign leader in the White House during his second term.' This is Netanyahu's third visit to Washington since the start of the war of extermination waged by Israel on the Gaza Strip since October 7, 2023, as Netanyahu sought to be the first to meet with Trump after his return to the White House. In a statement issued by Netanyahu's office, 'the US President invited the Israeli Prime Minister to visit the White House on Tuesday, February 4, 2025.' He emphasized that Netanyahu 'will be the first foreign leader to meet Trump in the White House during his second term.' The meeting between Trump and Netanyahu comes after Trump attributed the credit for reaching a ceasefire agreement in Gaza to himself, and a prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas, which came after months of fruitless negotiations. During his visit, Wietkof is expected to meet with Netanyahu and Minister of Security, Yisrael Katz, where the topic of discussion will be the second phase of negotiations related to the prisoner exchange agreement, which may pave the way for the end of the war on the strip if Israel adheres to it. In the context of his visit to the region, Wietkof plans to conduct a field visit to the Gaza Strip, which may include the 'Netzarim' crossing and the Karam Abu Salem crossing, amid reports that the US administration aims to ensure the complete implementation of the agreement in relation to the normalization path between Israel and Saudi Arabia. According to the Israeli public broadcasting authority ('Kan 11'), on Tuesday evening, the message that Wietkof will carry to Israel is that President Trump wants to implement the prisoner exchange deal in full, and that it is necessary to resolve the security and political differences to achieve this goal. Trump's envoy met with a Palestinian official in Riyadh. Wietkof met on Tuesday in Riyadh with the Secretary-General of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Hussein al-Sheikh, according to a report by the Israeli website 'Wallah' about sources described as 'informed.' The report stated that Trump's envoy discussed with the Palestinian official the relations between the United States and the Palestinian Authority and the new administration's plans in the Middle East, and pointed out that the meeting came as a result of weeks of quiet talks between officials in the Trump administration and the leadership of the Palestinian Authority. One of the sources stated that Saudi Arabia played a mediating role and contributed to organizing the meeting, which was held in its capital, Riyadh.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 10:42 PM\nSource:[arab48.com](https://www.arab48.com/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/2025/01/28/%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AB-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%84-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B7-%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%BA%D8%B2%D8%A9)\n\n**Trump invites Israel's Netanyahu to meet at White House next week**\nUS President Donald Trump has invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet at the White House next week, according to a statement from Netanyahu's office. The visit, planned for 4 February, would make Netanyahu the first foreign leader to visit during Trump's second term. Trump teased the upcoming visit, saying, 'I'm going to be speaking with Bibi Netanyahu in the not too distant future.' The meeting coincides with a fragile six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, following a deadly conflict that erupted in October 2023. Discussions are likely to touch on Trump's proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to neighbouring countries, which has been met with strong rejection from Jordan, Egypt, and Palestinian leaders. The ceasefire has temporarily halted hostilities, but the toll of the conflict remains staggering, with over 47,200 Palestinians killed in Gaza and over 1,200 Israelis dead since the war began in October.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 07:45 PM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/trump-invites-israels-netanyahu-to-meet-at-white-house-next-week-9804623/)\n\n**Netanyahu to Visit White House as Trump Shows Support for Israel**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to visit the White House on February 4, 2025, at the invitation of US President Donald Trump. This would be the first time a foreign leader has been invited to the White House by Trump since he took office. The visit is seen as a strong gesture of support for Netanyahu, who has been criticized internationally for his handling of the Gaza conflict. Trump has a history of pro-Israel policies, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the US embassy there. He also brokered the Abraham Accords, a normalization agreement between Israel and several Arab states. In his first days in office, Trump has already shown support for Netanyahu, including lifting a ban on the sale of heavy bombs to Israel and removing sanctions on radical Israeli settlers in the West Bank. However, Trump's idea to relocate Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to other countries has been met with criticism, even from some Israeli politicians.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 07:40 PM\nSource:[bbv-net.de](https://www.bbv-net.de/ueberregionales/netanjahu-trifft-auf-trumps-einladung-ins-weisse-haus-israel-politik-w990727-6000270581/)\n\n**Netanyahu Considers US Visit to Meet with Trump**\nAccording to Axios, a US news site, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering a visit to the US in early February to meet with President Trump. If the visit goes ahead, it would be Trump's first face-to-face meeting with a foreign leader since his second inauguration. The meeting is expected to discuss issues such as the Palestinian situation and the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. US Special Envoy for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, visited Israel on January 29 and held talks with Netanyahu and other officials on the implementation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. The visit to the US is also being coordinated, with a possible date between February 2-6. However, Netanyahu's health status may delay the visit, as he underwent prostate surgery in December 2024. The visit is seen as a follow-up to the 6-week ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas that was reached just before Trump's presidency began. Trump had previously claimed credit for the agreement, saying it was a result of his 'historic victory' in the 2024 presidential election.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 10:16 PM\nSource:[\u6bce\u65e5\u65b0\u805e](https://mainichi.jp/articles/20250128/k00/00m/030/002000c)\n\n**Trump's Envoy Seeks Deal Between Israel and Hamas Before Inauguration**\nUS President-elect Donald Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Wietkoff, has expressed Trump's desire to achieve a deal between Israel and the Palestinian movement Hamas before his inauguration on January 20. According to Axios, Wietkoff met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on January 11 and emphasized that Trump's goal is to reach a deal by January 20. A high-ranking Israeli official stated that Wietkoff repeatedly emphasized 'the goal of the inauguration day' during consultations with Netanyahu and the Israeli negotiation team. Sources close to the publication indicate that Israel and Hamas have made progress in negotiations, but contentious issues remain. While some believe it is possible to reach a deal within the tight timeframe, others are skeptical. The deal would involve an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel has been seeking Hamas' consent for the deal, with all details reportedly already determined, and the agreement could be reached within weeks. The situation in the Middle East escalated on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched a massive rocket attack on Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip, prompting Israel to launch retaliatory strikes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 12, 2025 06:49 AM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/1820727/2025-01-12/smi-soobsili-o-zelanii-trampa-do-inauguracii-dobitsa-sdelki-izraila-s-hamas)\n\n**Scholz Hopes to Visit Trump, Israeli Occupation Forces Continue to Violate Ceasefire Agreement**\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed his hope to visit US President-elect Donald Trump after he takes office on January 20, 2025. Despite the possibility of early German elections on February 23, 2025, sources in Berlin told the German news agency that 'it cannot be ruled out' that Scholz will meet Trump in Washington. Trump has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to attend his inauguration, but no other leaders have been invited. Trump has secured enough electoral votes to win the presidency, with 312 votes to 226 for Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The electoral college will formally elect Trump and Senator JD Vance as President and Vice President on January 6, 2025. Meanwhile, the Israeli occupation forces have carried out a airstrikes in southern Lebanon, claiming that they targeted a Hezbollah operative. The occupation forces have also continued to violate the ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, carrying out operations to destroy homes in the town of Kfar Kila and the town of Naqoura. Additionally, the occupation forces have launched a military operation in the area of the town of Naqoura, and have been flying over the cities of Tyre, Sidon, and the Beqaa Valley. The occupation forces have also warned the residents of the south not to return to their homes. In Gaza, the occupation forces have burned several homes in the Al-Jalaa neighborhood in the Jabalia refugee camp. The occupation forces have also announced that they have withdrawn the 98th Brigade from southern Lebanon after three months of fighting against Hezbollah, and have redeployed it to the Gaza Strip.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 08:01 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0639](https://www.youm7.com/story/2024/12/18/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D9%87%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AD-%D8%B4%D9%88%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B2-%D9%8A%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%81%D9%89-%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA/6815638)\n\n",
