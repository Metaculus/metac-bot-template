    "question": "Will the US officially announce the withdrawal of at least half of its troops out of Syria before April, 2025?",
    "description": "According to [NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/dod-drafting-plans-withdraw-us-troops-syria-recent-trump-comments-rcna190726), the US Department of Defense is drafting plans for a full withdrawal of American troops from Syria following renewed interest from Donald Trump. The proposed withdrawal could occur within 30, 60, or 90 days, though officials emphasise that no final decision has been made. Trump had briefly removed US forces from Syria in the past, however he quickly reinstated them and as of early 2025, approximately 2,000 personnel are stationed there (1,100 troops as \"temporary rotational forces\" and 900 as \"core troops\"). The US military mission in Syria has been to counter ISIS and support local military groups, such as the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). A withdrawal could jeopardize these efforts, particularly regarding the security of detention facilities housing thousands of ISIS fighters.",
    "fine_print": "* The \"at least half\" part of the resolution criteria could be resolved in various ways, including but not limited to an announcement that at least 1,000 troops will be withdrawn or a maximum of 1,000 troops will remain stationed there, or an announcement that all temporary rotation forces will be withdrawn.\n* For this question to resolve as **Yes** via an announcement, it will have to be an official announcement (e.g., via a DoD press briefing, an Executive Order, or CENTCOM official communications) and it will have to imply that a specific plan has been created and the decision to implement it has been made. Vague announcements of intent will not suffice.\n* For purposes of this question, the number of US troops in Syria is assumed to be 2,000. In cases in which the denominator is announced to be different from 2,000, the one-half threshold will be adjusted accordingly.",

Salam made an urgent appeal to the US mediator to pressure the Netanyahu government to fully withdraw from Lebanese territory before February 18, 2025. Israel had requested to maintain its troops in five southern Lebanon positions until February 28.

According to Major General Ori Gordon, the head of the Israeli military's Northern Command, 'I think we will indeed reposition ourselves next week and the agreement will be implemented.' However, Lebanon's presidency has denied reports of a second extension, stating that President Joseph Aoun has 'repeatedly stressed Lebanon's insistence on the complete withdrawal' of Israeli troops by February 18. Hezbollah has also urged Lebanon's government to ensure the troops leave, but has not explicitly threatened to resume fighting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 06:14 PM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/news-today/israel-us-lebanon-truce-deadline-9833031/)\n\n**Lebanon Insists on Israeli Withdrawal from Southern Territory by February 18**\nLebanon is insisting that Israeli forces withdraw from the southern part of the country by February 18, as agreed upon. 'Israeli forces must leave the Lebanese territory by the set deadline (February 18. \u2013 Profile). We expect the withdrawal to be completed by this date, and we ask the European Union to put pressure on Israel to make it comply with its obligations,' said a general, according to the presidential administration's press office. However, Israel has expressed its intention to delay the withdrawal of its forces from five border areas in southern Lebanon until February 28, at a meeting of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) ceasefire monitoring committee. This proposal was categorically rejected by the representative of the Lebanese army, who suggested sending UN peacekeepers to five populated areas that Israel wanted to maintain under its control for another 10 days. A bilateral ceasefire agreement was signed on November 27, 2024, with the mediation of the US and France. It provides for the deployment of the Lebanese army along the entire southern border with the support of UN peacekeepers and the withdrawal of 'Hezbollah' formations behind the Litani River. Under this agreement, Israel was required to withdraw its forces from southern Lebanon within 60 days, where they were conducting a ground operation. On January 27, the White House officially announced the extension of the deadline for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory to February 18.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 05:20 PM\nSource:[profile.ru](https://profile.ru/news/abroad/livan-nastaivaet-na-uhode-izrailskih-vojsk-s-juga-strany-k-18-fevralya-v-sootvetstvii-s-soglasheniem-a999-1661348/)\n\n**US official says Israel asked for Lebanon pullout extension but won't get it**\nIsrael has asked the Trump administration for an extension of the deadline for the Israeli army's withdrawal from southern Lebanon, but the US has refused, according to a US official.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had requested US support for a further extension, citing concerns that the Lebanese Army is not effectively deployed in the region and that Hezbollah is reorganizing. However, the US views February 18 as a 'firm date' for the completion of Israel's withdrawal, as stated by US deputy Mideast envoy Morgan Ortagus.

Firstly, the head of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), Laura Rosenberger, has been removed from her position, with her official account on the AIT's website being deleted. This move is seen as a signal from the Trump administration to clear out Biden-era officials. Rosenberger's removal is not unexpected, given her close ties to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and her short tenure as AIT head. Secondly, the US Department of Defense is planning to withdraw all American troops from Syria, according to NBC News. This move is seen as a response to the growing pressure from regional countries, including Turkey, Iraq, and Jordan, which have formed a joint mechanism to counter extremist groups. The US withdrawal is also seen as a reflection of its prioritization of domestic economic interests over military spending. Finally, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) has maintained a high level of alertness in the South China Sea, responding to the Philippines' recent provocations. The PLA has stated that it will continue to defend China's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights, and has warned that any military activities that threaten regional stability will be met with a firm response.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 11:36 AM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/858162194_121997468?scm=10001.279_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0.a2_5X162X1532)\n\n**Lebanese Officials Confirm Israeli Withdrawal Will Be Complete on Schedule**\nAccording to information from 'al-Nahar', Lebanese officials have been informed that the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon will be complete on schedule, following firm commitments from the US administration.

However, U.S. officials, including Morgan Ortagus, have reaffirmed that February 18 remains a firm deadline for Israeli forces to complete their withdrawal. Ortagus stated, 'February 18th will be the date for redeployment when the IDF completes its withdrawal.' Israeli officials have accused the Lebanese military of failing to meet its commitments under the ceasefire agreement, and have requested a 10-day extension until February 28. However, a U.S. National Security Council spokesperson has stated that Israel remains committed to the existing timeline and has not formally requested an extension beyond February 18.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[dailystar.com.lb](https://dailystar.com.lb/will-israel-pull-out-lebanon-february-18/)\n\n**Israel Establishes Security Zone in Syria, Plans to Stay Until 2025**\nAccording to the Israeli army radio, Israel has established a security zone within Syrian territory, with no final date set for its withdrawal.

The number of Israeli forces deployed in the area has also increased to three brigades, up from one and a half brigades before October 7, 2023. The Israeli army plans to continue its presence in Syria until the end of 2025, as stated by the channel.

Israeli officials are still in talks with the US to improve the situation on the ground, despite the firm deadline. The US administration believes that the Lebanese army will be fully deployed by February 18, and the IDF is expected to withdraw from other areas in southern Lebanon in the coming days. The ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, which was initially slated to expire on January 27, was extended to February 18 after Israel claimed that the Lebanese army had not been fully deployed in southern Lebanon. According to senior US official Morgan Ortagus, 'The US and the Lebanese government agreed to extend the deadline after Israel claimed that the Lebanese army had not been fully deployed in southern Lebanon.' Ortagus also stated that the US 'reiterated its stance' over the weekend, emphasizing the importance of the ceasefire deal. The US has also condemned recent exchanges of fire along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, and Israeli Air Force jets struck a Hezbollah tunnel that crossed from Lebanon into Syria and was used for smuggling weapons into the country.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 06:33 PM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-841527)\n\n**Palestinian Resistance Forces Israeli Army to Withdraw from Netzarim Axis**\nParticipants in the Al Jazeera Mubasher live broadcast described the Israeli army's withdrawal from the Netzarim axis in the Gaza Strip as a 'devastating blow to the arrogant Zionist entity' and a 'strategic defeat for its forces'. They attributed the withdrawal to the Palestinian resistance, saying that it was the one that forced the Israeli army to leave the area. The participants praised the Palestinian people and their resistance for their steadfastness in the face of Israeli crimes. They also warned that if the Israeli army does not withdraw completely from Palestine, a 'storm of Jerusalem' is coming to defeat the occupation. The Israeli army announced its complete withdrawal from the Netzarim axis, after more than a year and three months of occupation. The withdrawal was part of a broader Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, which began in November 2023 and forced over a million Palestinians to flee to the southern part of the Strip under bombardment and extermination. In January 2025, the Israeli army began its official withdrawal from the Netzarim axis, allowing over half a million displaced Palestinians to return to the northern part of the Strip. 'A great day', said the participants, 'a victory for the Palestinian people and their resistance'.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 08:54 AM\nSource:[aljazeeramubasher.net](https://www.aljazeeramubasher.net/peoples-voice/2025/2/10/%D9%87%D9%83%D8%B0%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%84-%D8%AC%D9%85%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%B9-10)\n\n**Trump's Plan to Withdraw Troops from Syria: A Complex and Controversial Move**\nUS President Trump has announced plans to withdraw troops from Syria, a move that has sparked controversy. Since Trump took office, his administration has implemented a series of new policies, including military adjustments. Trump's unique diplomatic approach and military strategy have challenged traditional international perceptions, and his recent decision to withdraw from Syria is the latest example. Syria has been a focal point in the Middle East, and the US military presence there has been a subject of debate. Trump's decision to withdraw seems to be an attempt to pull the US out of the complex regional conflict. Reviewing the US military presence in Syria, there have been many twists and turns. To intervene in the Syrian political situation, the US has deployed a large number of troops for an extended period. As of the end of 2024, the number of US troops stationed in Syria remains around 900, mainly concentrated in the north and west, exerting significant influence on local politics and military situations. Before the fall of the Assad regime, the US increased its troop deployment to around 2,500, but as the situation evolved and the international landscape changed, the US military presence in Syria became a burden. Trump has expressed his desire to withdraw troops on multiple occasions. On February 5, Sky News reported that two Defense Department officials revealed that the Pentagon has begun preparing a plan to withdraw all US troops from Syria. This plan was quickly initiated after Trump shared his withdrawal wishes with close advisors. The Pentagon is studying the possibility of implementing the withdrawal within 30 to 90 days to quickly end US military action in Syria.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 03:39 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250206/47938758.html)\n\n**US Plans to Withdraw All Troops from Syria within 90 Days**\nUS officials have confirmed that the Pentagon is planning to withdraw all US troops from Syria within 90 days. This comes after President Donald Trump previously hinted that Syria has enough chaos and does not need US presence. The officials stated that Trump and his close advisors have recently shown interest in withdrawing US troops from Syria, prompting the Pentagon to start planning for a complete withdrawal within 30, 60, or 90 days. In contrast, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by Kurds, announced that they have not received any plans for US troop withdrawal from northern and eastern Syria. The SDF spokesperson, Farhad Shami, told Reuters that 'ISIS and other extremist groups are waiting for the US withdrawal to resume their activities and reach the level of 2014.' Meanwhile, a military source revealed that the Syrian Defense Ministry has assigned the task of establishing a new army to two independent committees, the Reorganization Committee and the Appointments Committee. The source, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that the Reorganization Committee is headed by Brigadier General Abdul Rahman Hussein Al-Khatib, one of the 5 officers who were promoted to the rank of Brigadier General in the promotions announced by the Defense Ministry on December 28, 2024.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 07:11 PM\nSource:[Alrai-media](https://www.alraimedia.com/article/1717038/%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85/%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%B7-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%AD%D8%A8-%D9%83%D9%84-%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A7)\n\n**Pentagon Develops Plans for US Troop Withdrawal from Syria**\nThe Pentagon is developing plans for a full withdrawal of US troops from Syria, according to two Pentagon officials.

The officials stated that the Pentagon has begun developing plans for a complete withdrawal of US troops from Syria within 30, 60, or 90 days. Trump's new national security advisor, Mike Waltz, met with US military commanders last week at the Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, to discuss the latest developments in the region. In a press conference on January 30, Trump was asked about reports of a potential US withdrawal from Syria. 'I don't know who said that, but we'll make a decision on that. We won't interfere in Syria,' Trump said. The President emphasized that the US should not 'interfere in Syria's affairs.' 'We'll make a decision on Syria. Syria has its own problems. There's already enough chaos there. We don't need to interfere,' Trump said. In December 2024, the Pentagon announced that approximately 2000 US troops were stationed in Syria, more than double the officially stated number of 900 troops. A Pentagon official explained that the additional 1100 troops are 'temporary rotational forces' with a stay of 30 to 90 days, while the 900 troops are the 'main contingent' stationed there for about a year.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 01:24 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ru/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80/%D0%BF%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BD-%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8B-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%83%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%B9-%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0-%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B8%D1%85-%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA-%D0%B8%D0%B7-%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B8/3472791)\n\n**US Prepares to Withdraw Troops from Syria**\nThe US Department of Defense is working on plans to withdraw US troops from Syria, following President Donald Trump's intention to end the US presence in the country.

Trump's new national security advisor, Mike Waltz, recently visited the CENTCOM headquarters to discuss the situation with senior military officials. A White House official said that Waltz's visit was 'important to better understand the situation in the region.' Trump stated in a January press conference that he had not made a final decision on withdrawing from Syria, but was considering the option. When asked if Israel had been informed about the potential withdrawal, Trump replied, 'I don't know who said that, but we will make a decision. We will not be included in Syria.' Trump added, 'There's already enough chaos there. We don't need to add to it.' Trump previously ordered the withdrawal of all US troops from Syria in 2019, but Defense Secretary James Mattis resigned in opposition to the plan. Although most US troops were withdrawn at the time, the Trump administration later redeployed some of them. The Pentagon announced in December 2024 that approximately 2,000 US troops remained in Syria.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 01:10 PM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/abd-suriye-den-cekilme-planlari-hazirliyor-p136410)\n\n**US Plans for Complete Withdrawal from Syria within 30-90 Days**\nThe US Department of Defense has planned for a complete withdrawal from Syria within 30 to 90 days.

Trump's new national security advisor, Mike Waltz, met with top military leaders at the US Central Command headquarters in Tampa, Florida, on January 31, where he received briefings on the Middle East. According to White House officials, the potential reduction of US forces in Syria was not discussed or the purpose of Waltz's visit. Sineen Mohammed, a representative of the Syrian Democratic Council in Washington, said that Trump will decide the fate of his country in Syria in the coming days, citing that they have expressed to the US side their desire to continue the work of the forces until a comprehensive solution is reached in Syria. The negotiations between the Syrian Democratic Forces and the Syrian government are ongoing and have not yet ended, according to Roudaw. On January 30, Trump said that he would make a decision on the presence of US forces in Syria. In response to a question about his intention to withdraw US forces from Syria, Trump said, 'I don't know who said that, but we will make a decision on that.' He added, 'We are not involved in Syria, Syria is in chaos, they have enough chaos there, they don't need our involvement.' Trump's statements came after a report by the Israeli Broadcasting Authority (Makan) on January 29, which stated that US officials informed their Israeli counterparts that Trump wants to withdraw US forces from Syria, sparking concerns in Israel and potential impacts on the Syrian Democratic Forces in the region. Makan reported that Trump wants to withdraw thousands of American soldiers from Syria. There are currently 900 US soldiers in Syria, with an additional 1,100 soldiers deployed in December 2024, described by a Pentagon spokesperson as 'essential forces' deployed for about a year.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 11:44 AM\nSource:[\u0639\u0646\u0628 \u0628\u0644\u062f\u064a](https://www.enabbaladi.net/?p=737750&preview=true&preview_id=737750)\n\n**US Plans to Withdraw All Troops from Syria**\nAccording to sources, the US Department of Defense is working on plans to withdraw all US troops from Syria.

According to NBC News, two Pentagon officials revealed this information on February 4. The move was prompted by President Trump and his advisors expressing interest in withdrawing American soldiers from Syria. This has led the Pentagon to start developing plans for a complete withdrawal within 30, 60, or 90 days. Trump was asked about the report during a press conference in the Oval Office last week, where he was questioned about a message he allegedly sent to Israeli authorities regarding the withdrawal of American troops from Syria. In December 2019, Trump ordered then-Defense Secretary James Mattis to withdraw all American troops from Syria, but Mattis opposed the plan and eventually resigned in protest. Trump subsequently withdrew a significant portion of the troops, but then returned them. The US presence in Syria has remained since then. The Pentagon announced in December 2024 that approximately 2,000 troops had been deployed to Syria. American military officials claim their mission in Syria is to combat terrorists and support 'local partners.' However, Pentagon representatives warn that withdrawing American troops would put the security of over 20 prisons and refugee camps at risk, where over 50,000 people, including around 9,000 militants, are being held. The Washington Post previously reported that the US is working on a new strategy for Syria, citing the sudden collapse of the country's government in late 2024 as a reason for the need to reassess their approach. The article noted that US-backed Kurds continue to guard the Al-Hol camp and other prisons in northeastern Syria, where thousands of terrorists are being held.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 11:20 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/army/54157212-v-pentagone-nachali-planirovat-vyvod-voysk-iz-sirii/)\n\n**US to Withdraw Troops from Syria, Pentagon Preparing Plan**\nAccording to NBC News, the Pentagon is preparing a plan to withdraw all US troops from Syria.

As NBC News reported, 'President Trump and officials close to him recently expressed interest in pulling US troops out of Syria, leading Pentagon officials to begin drawing up plans for a full withdrawal in 30, 60 or 90 days.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 10:30 AM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-840777)\n\n**US Plans to Withdraw All Troops from Syria within 30-90 Days**\nUS officials have revealed plans to withdraw all American troops from Syria within the next 30 to 90 days. According to NBC, the Pentagon is working on a plan to withdraw all US forces from Syrian territory. This decision comes after President Donald Trump expressed interest in withdrawing US troops from Syria in recent times. Trump previously hinted that Syria has enough chaos and does not need US presence, saying 'we will see and take the appropriate decision' regarding the withdrawal of US troops. The US had previously announced that around 900 troops were stationed in Syria, but the Pentagon confirmed in December 2024 that the number had increased to around 2,000. Trump had previously called for the previous administration to not intervene in the Syrian conflict, saying it does not concern the US.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[alnasnews.com.jo](https://alnasnews.com.jo/online/head/786362.html)\n\n**Trump Leaves Option Open for US Troop Withdrawal from Syria**\nUS President Donald Trump has left the option open to consider withdrawing American troops from Syria. According to White House Press Secretary Caroline Lavinia 'Caroline' Lavinia Smith, also known as 'Caroline Lavinia' Lavinia,  'Yesterday, the President was asked this question, and he answered it. As the Commander-in-Chief of the US Armed Forces, he reserves the right to reconsider the deployment of troops abroad at any time', she said at a press briefing, responding to a question about whether Trump is considering withdrawing troops from Syria. She was also asked if the topic is currently being discussed, to which Lavinia replied affirmatively. Trump stated on Thursday that Washington should not interfere with Syria's problems, and the US administration will make a decision regarding the possibility of withdrawing American troops from the Arab republic. High-ranking US officials have reportedly informed Israeli representatives that Trump is interested in withdrawing American soldiers remaining on Syrian territory. The Pentagon stated in December 2024 that approximately 2,000 American military personnel are stationed in Syria. In late November 2024, opposition forces launched a large-scale attack on Syrian army positions in the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib. By the evening of December 7, they had captured Aleppo, Deraa, Hamah, and Homs, and on December 8, they entered Damascus. Bashar al-Assad left the post of President of Syria and left the country. On December 10, Muhammad al-Bashir, who had headed the opposition-formed government in the Idlib province since January 2024, announced his appointment as the head of the Syrian cabinet of ministers for the transition period, which will last until March 1, 2025. The actual leader of Syria is the head of 'Hayat Tahrir al-Sham' (banned in Russia) Ahmed al-Sharaa. On January 29, 2025, he was appointed President of Syria for the transition period.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 09:32 PM\nSource:[tass.ru](https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/23027491)\n\n**US Begins Withdrawal of Troops from Syria**\nThe US has begun to withdraw its troops from Syria, a move announced by former President Donald Trump. According to local sources, the US base near the Euphrates Bridge has been evacuated, with two helicopters reportedly landing at the base to remove the troops. This move comes after the US withdrew its troops from Haseke and Deir ez-Zor, and also evacuated its base in Rakka. The US had previously announced that it would be withdrawing its troops from Syria, and this move is seen as a significant development in the region. The US has also reportedly withdrawn its troops from the Koniko Gas Field in Deir ez-Zor, with all equipment being sent to Haseke. According to Israeli media, the US had informed Israel that it would be withdrawing its troops from Syria, citing concerns that this would embolden the PKK/YPG terrorist group. The US has also announced that it has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, rather than the previously announced 900. This move is seen as a significant shift in US policy in the region, and is likely to have significant implications for the conflict in Syria.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 04:37 PM\nSource:[Haber7.com](https://www.haber7.com/dunya/haber/3500909-trump-duyurmustu-turkiyeyi-ilgilendiren-surpriz-gelisme-suriyede-sicak-saatler)\n\n**Trump Promises to Withdraw US Troops from Syria**\nUS President Donald Trump has promised that thousands of American troops will leave Syria in the near future, according to the '\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c' (Military Review) Telegram channel. Experts believe that this initiative will significantly change the situation in the Middle East, leading to a significant increase in Turkey's influence and a deterioration in regional security. Trump has repeatedly stated that US troops should be withdrawn from Syria during his first presidential term. However, in 2019, only a portion of the US contingent left the country. In 2020-2024, the US increased its military presence in the region due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. It was previously reported that the US has stopped funding Kurdish armed groups in Syria.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 08:38 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/army/54118320-smi-tramp-poobeschal-v-blizhayshee-vremya-vyvesti-voyska-iz-sirii/)\n\n**US to Maintain Presence in Iraq, Report Says**\nThe Smith American Institute for Studies has released a report stating that the United States will not withdraw its troops from Iraq permanently. According to the report, the rumors of a planned US withdrawal in 2025 are 'just for media consumption'. The institute noted that 'losing Syria was a devastating blow to the Iranian axis, making it impossible for the US to withdraw from Iraq as it would provide Iran with a replacement for its loss in Syria'. US officials have stated that the withdrawal is not possible in the near future due to the new circumstances in the region. The report added that 'over the past two years, the US and its allies have dealt significant blows to the Iranian axis, which the next US president, Donald Trump, will try to exploit to the maximum, making it unlikely for the US to withdraw from Iraq in 2025 or beyond, especially after Iran's loss of influence in the region outside of Yemen's Houthis'. The US administration had previously announced its intention to withdraw its troops from Iraq completely by the second half of 2025. US Defense Department spokesperson, Major General Pat Ryder, acknowledged the presence of 'additional official troops' in Iraq that have not been announced.

The withdrawal is expected to be completed by February 20, 2025, as per a request from the new Syrian government. The move is seen as a response to international pressure and a condition for lifting sanctions. Despite the withdrawal, Russia will maintain its two main military bases in Syria, Tartus and Hmeimim. The US has welcomed the move, saying it will increase the freedom of action for US aircraft in Syrian airspace. The withdrawal is a significant development in the complex geopolitical landscape of the Middle East, where various powers are vying for influence. Russia's military presence in Syria has been a key factor in the region's dynamics, and its withdrawal will likely have far-reaching consequences. As one analyst noted, 'the biggest winner' in this situation is the US, which will gain more space to operate in the region. The Syrian government has also expressed its commitment to respecting the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and has warned Iran against interfering in Syrian affairs. The situation remains fluid, and it is unclear how the withdrawal will affect the balance of power in the region.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 09:00 PM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/843418123_121997483?scm=10001.279_13-101000-0_922.0-0.0.a2_5X162X1532)\n\n",
