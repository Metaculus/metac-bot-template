        "fine_print": "For the purposes of this question, a successful landing will be defined as one which results in the lander remaining intact and able to communicate with the Earth, and which does not prevent at least some of its payload from being able to carry out its intended mission. For example, a landing that resulted in minor damage to the lander, its systems, or some of its payload, but some of the carried payload/equipment was still able to carry out its intended mission and communicate with Earth, would result in the question resolving as Yes (this does not include cases where the lander is destroyed on impact but payloads such as time capsules might survive impact)",

The lander, carrying 10 science and technology instruments for NASA, will descend into Mare Crisium, a large impact basin on the lunar near side, on March 2. The mission aims to assess longer-term lunar habitability prospects, including the possibility of a permanent Moon base. Blue Ghost's descent will be controlled using thrusters, as there is no atmosphere to provide natural drag. If successful, the lander will operate its science payload for 14 Earth days, capturing a solar eclipse and a lunar sunset, before shutting down forever. 'The radiator panels are moving nominally to protect Blue Ghost's subsystems from extreme temperatures,' the company wrote on its live blog. 'The video below, sped up by 10X, was taken about 100 km above the lunar surface, showing the far side of the Moon and a top-down view of Blue Ghost's RCS thrusters (center) and radiator panels on each side.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 12:54 AM\nSource:[ScienceAlert](https://www.sciencealert.com/blue-ghost-captures-stunning-moon-footage-ahead-of-historic-landing)\n\n**Blue Ghost Spacecraft Captures Rare Images of Earth Eclipsing the Moon**\nThe Blue Ghost spacecraft, created by Firefly Aerospace, has shared a treasure trove of photographs from its recent mission to the Moon's orbit, including a stunning selfie with the Earth eclipsing the Moon in the background. The spacecraft, launched on January 15, captured impressive images of the Earth and Moon during its mission. It is now in orbit and is scheduled to land on March 2. Blue Ghost carries 10 scientific instruments that will help study the lunar surface, measure electric and magnetic fields, and test new technologies. This spacecraft is part of NASA's program where private companies are exploring the Moon. On its way to the Moon, the spacecraft took several photos, including a selfie of the Earth. One of the most striking images shows the Earth eclipsing the Moon, creating a breathtaking view that is rarely captured. Blue Ghost reached the Moon's orbit on February 13. If the landing is successful, it will become the second private spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon, following the Odysseus module from Intuitive Machines, which landed in February 2024. The landing site for Blue Ghost is the Mare Crisium crater, an ancient impact crater partially filled with basaltic lava. The spacecraft also captured the far side of the Moon, which is not visible from Earth. As for the history of space exploration, the first images of the Earth from space were taken in 1946 using a V-2 rocket launched from New Mexico, USA, which reached an altitude of around 105 km and took several black-and-white photos of the planet. The first images of the Moon's surface were obtained in 1959 by the Soviet spacecraft 'Luna-1', and more detailed images were seen in 1966 by 'Luna-9', which successfully landed on the Moon's surface. After landing, Blue Ghost will conduct a series of experiments, studying the composition of the soil and properties of lunar dust. These data will help scientists better understand the history of the Moon and prepare technologies for future missions. The spacecraft has already shared stunning images, and more scientific discoveries are ahead.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 03:13 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u043e\u0447\u0442\u0430@Mail.ru](https://hi-tech.mail.ru/news/123344-kosmicheskij-apparat-blue-ghost-zapechatlel-redkie-vidy-zatmeniya-zemli-lunoj/)\n\n**Spacecraft beams back stunning moon video before ambitious landing**\nFirefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost spacecraft is set to land on the moon's near side on March 2, as part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program.

The company has improved navigation and equipment to increase the chances of a successful landing. The Athena mission is expected to land on the Moon's Mons-Munon plateau on March 6, closer to the southern pole than any previous lunar mission. On board, there is scientific equipment, including a drill to search for ice beneath the surface and a jumping drone named Grace, named after scientist Grace Hopper. The drone can navigate the complex lunar terrain with its slopes, boulders, and craters, which could be valuable for future manned missions. Additionally, a small rover will test the lunar cellular network provided by Nokia Bell Labs for transmitting commands, images, and video between the landing module, rover, and drone. However, the main challenge remains achieving a perfect landing, which the company failed to achieve with its first landing module Odysseus in February 2024. General Director Trent Martin acknowledged the difficulties and stated that the company has made key improvements, including upgrading the cable system of the laser altimeter, which provides data on height and speed and helps choose a safe landing site. The coordination with NASA's deep space communication network has also been improved for more accurate navigation. The arrival of Athena on the Moon on March 2 is expected to be preceded by the landing of another private American spacecraft, Blue Ghost from Firefly Aerospace, launched in January. Additionally, a NASA Lunar Trailblazer probe will be launched on the same rocket, which will enter orbit after a four-month journey and begin a two-year mission to study the distribution of various forms of water on the Moon. 'We've made significant improvements to our landing technology, including the laser altimeter and our communication systems,' said Trent Martin, CEO of Intuitive Machines.

The spacecraft's engines were fired for 3 minutes and 18 seconds on February 18, allowing it to transition from a high, elliptical orbit to a lower orbit about 120 km (75 miles) above the Moon's surface. From this new location, Blue Ghost captured new images of the far side of the Moon and transmitted them back to Earth. Although this maneuver is crucial for preparing the spacecraft for its planned landing on March 2, it comes with challenges, including periods of temporary communication loss between the spacecraft and the control team in Texas. During the long journey that began on January 15, the team was able to calibrate the instruments on board. Blue Ghost will use its 10 scientific instruments to analyze the lunar heat flow, measure the magnetic and electric fields on the surface, and study the chemical composition of the lunar regolith. The spacecraft will also test technologies that could contribute to NASA's Artemis mission, which aims to send humans to the Moon. 'Blue Ghost' is not a direct flight from Kennedy Space Center to the Moon, but rather a journey that included several weeks in orbit around Earth after launch. During this time, the spacecraft's cameras captured stunning images of our planet. Blue Ghost is the latest private spacecraft attempting to land on the Moon, following previous successes and failures. In April 2023, the Japanese company's Hakuto-R M1 spacecraft crashed during its landing attempt. In January 2024, the Astrobotic Perseverance spacecraft failed in its mission after launch. However, in February 2024, the Intuitive Machines' Odyssey spacecraft successfully landed, despite suffering a leg break. If Blue Ghost successfully lands safely, it will soon be joined by the Intuitive Machines' Resilience spacecraft, which was launched on the same Falcon 9 rocket. The Resilience spacecraft is expected to attempt a landing in May or June, carrying the robot Tenacious to explore the lunar regolith. Intuitive Machines is also planning to launch another mission next week, featuring a robot capable of jumping on the lunar surface to explore a permanently dark crater.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 11:43 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/space/1648263-%D8%A8%D9%84%D9%88-%D8%BA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%85%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%AA/)\n\n**Blue Ghost Lunar Lander Makes Historic Images of the Moon's Far Side**\nThe Blue Ghost lunar lander, developed by Firefly Aerospace, has successfully progressed towards its goal.

From this position, the lander made new images of the Moon's far side and transmitted them back to Earth. This maneuver prepared Blue Ghost for its planned March 2 landing in the Mare Crisium region, a lunar basin formed by an ancient asteroid impact and filled with basaltic lava. The lander carries 10 scientific instruments to analyze the thermal flow from the Moon's interior, study the magnetic and electric fields on the surface, and determine the chemical composition of the lunar regolith. The mission will also test technologies that could be used in NASA's Artemis program, aimed at returning humans to the Moon. This phase allowed the onboard instruments to be calibrated before further travel. Previous private attempts at lunar landing have had mixed results. In April 2023, the Japanese Hakuto-R M1 lander, developed by ispace, crashed during its landing attempt. In January 2024, the American Peregrine lander, developed by Astrobotic, also failed, crashing shortly after launch. However, in February 2024, the Odysseus lander, developed by Intuitive Machines, successfully landed, albeit with a damaged leg. If Blue Ghost's landing is successful, it will be a significant achievement for private space missions. A Japanese lander, Resilience, developed by ispace, is expected to land soon, with a planned launch in May or June 2025. It will carry a rover, Tenacious, designed to study the lunar regolith in the far north of the Moon.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 09:48 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/tech/54234933-blue-ghost-sdelal-redkie-snimki-obratnoy-storony-luny-video/)\n\n**Private Lunar Lander Blue Ghost Successfully Enters Orbit Around the Moon**\nThe private lunar lander Blue Ghost, developed by Firefly Aerospace, has successfully entered into orbit around the Moon after a nearly month-long spaceflight. The lander, which is scheduled to attempt a landing on the Moon's surface on March 2, has captured stunning images of the Moon's surface using its cameras. The images show the Moon's surface, covered in craters, and were taken from a close distance. Blue Ghost was launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on January 15 and is carrying 10 scientific and technological experiments for NASA. The experiments aim to better understand the local environment and prepare for a human mission to the Moon in 2027. If the landing is successful, it will be a historic achievement, as only one private lander has successfully landed on the Moon before, Intuitive Machines' lander in February 2024. Another private lander, Resilience, developed by ispace, is also on its way to the Moon, but with a longer trajectory and no scientific experiments for NASA. 'This is a significant step towards a human mission to the Moon in 2027,' said NASA officials.

The spacecraft is scheduled to land on the Moon's surface in early March. Blue Ghost launched its engines for four minutes and 15 seconds on February 13, putting it into an elliptical orbit around the Moon before attempting a landing. During this time, the spacecraft took several photos, which were combined into a 27-second slow-motion video. The mission is part of NASA's CLPS program, which includes 10 scientific and technical experiments. These include studying lunar dust, the radiation environment on the Moon, and the interaction between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere. After landing, the spacecraft will also measure the distance to Earth using a laser reflector. The results of the experiments will help NASA better understand the lunar environment before sending astronauts to the Moon. Blue Ghost is expected to spend the next two weeks in lunar orbit, then fire its engine to make a close flyby of the Moon, and finally attempt a landing on March 2 in the Sea of Crises region. A successful landing would be historic, as only one private company, Intuitive Machines, has successfully landed a spacecraft on the Moon before, with the Odysseus spacecraft landing near the Moon's southern pole in 2024.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 03:55 PM\nSource:[\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0434\u0430](https://life.pravda.com.ua/society/yak-viglyadaye-misyac-iz-yogo-orbiti-foto-poverhni-suputnika-zrobiv-kosmichniy-aparat-blue-ghost-306455/)\n\n**Blue Ghost Successfully Reaches Lunar Orbit\u2014Next Stop: Mare Crisium**\nThe Blue Ghost lander, launched by Firefly Aerospace, has successfully reached lunar orbit, marking a major milestone in the company's mission to study the Moon's environment.
