Since Tesla has been significantly increasing their energy storage deployments over recent years, I can use their recent quarterly growth rates as a base rate. As a reference, Tesla reported approximately 3.9 GWh in Q1 2024, marking a substantial increase from the 2.1 GWh in Q1 2023. Therefore, assuming a continuation of previous growth trends, a modest growth can place the base rate around 5.0 to 6.0 GWh for Q1 2025.",
