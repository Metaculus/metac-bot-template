The executive order, signed on January 20, aimed to 'restore names that honor American greatness', but the agencies involved did not technically violate the order as it gave the Secretary of the Interior a 30-day deadline to review and implement the renaming process. Trump himself described the new designation as 'beautiful', but the move sparked a dispute with Mexico and Google announced a few weeks ago that it would change the name on its maps. However, the recent usage of the traditional name has raised questions about the consequences for the officials at the U.S. agency, particularly in the context of recent geopolitical tensions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 10:27 PM\nSource:[CNN](https://www.cnnchile.com/mundo/despite-donald-trumps-executive-order-u-s-government-agencies-used-the-name-gulf-of-mexico-for-tsunami-alert-information-after-earthquake-in-the-area_20250208/)\n\n**US Agencies Defy Trump's Order, Use 'Gulf of Mexico' Name**\nDespite an executive order from Donald Trump, US agencies used the name 'Gulf of Mexico' in official communications about a tsunami warning in the region.

Trump's order stated, 'Reaffirm the names that honor the greatness of the United States.' However, the USGS and NTWC used the traditional name in their communications, including a tsunami warning for the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast of the US and Canada. This move has sparked a dispute with Mexico, with President Claudia Sheinbaum joking about renaming the southern US region as 'Mexican America.'

Although no transit restrictions were applied during this period, the passage of bulk carriers, liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers, and oil tankers did not recover to their previous levels. BIMCO reported that the restrictions imposed between June 2023 and September 2024 due to the low level of Lake Gatun affected the total number of transits and the draft of the ships. 'Diversos factores han influido en la lenta recuperaci\u00f3n del tr\u00e1nsito de ciertos sectores,' BIMCO said. Some factors that have influenced the slow recovery of certain sectors include changes in maritime routes, which have led some ships to opt for alternative routes, such as the Cape of Good Hope or the Cape Horn. In the grain sector, the export of grains from the United States experienced modifications, with a 21% increase in the transit of shipments from the west coast to Pacific ports and a 6% decrease in the transit of shipments originating from the Gulf of Mexico. The transit of coal also remains below pre-restriction levels, as alternative routes continue to be used. However, the transit of smaller grain cargoes, such as steel and fertilizers, is approaching pre-limitation levels. In the case of LNG, tankers have barely resumed using the Canal due to operational and security restrictions. The availability of reservations is limited, and nighttime transits are not permitted, which has encouraged the use of other routes considered more flexible. Despite these changes, some sectors have noted growth in their transit through the Canal. Container ships, LNG tankers, and carriers have exceeded historical levels and may continue in this trend. However, the prospects for grain transportation present uncertainty due to competition between the United States and Brazil in grain exports, as well as predictions of lower coal demand, concluded BIMCO.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 05:22 AM\nSource:[La Estrella de Panam\u00e1](https://www.laestrella.com.pa/economia/transitos-por-el-canal-de-panama-bajan-un-10-NN10594966)\n\n**Ongoing repairs following Naples plane crash**\nThe one-year anniversary of a deadly plane crash in Naples, Florida, is being marked by ongoing repairs to the damage caused by the incident. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) is working to repair three sections and restore 30 sections of the sound barrier wall that were affected. According to an FDOT spokesperson, their focus is on 'being respectful to those who lost their lives last year' while completing the necessary repairs. Heather Mazurkiewicz of North Collier Fire Rescue praised the pilots, saying, 'The pilots tragically lost their lives, but to be able to maneuver that plane, were that they put that plane down, not on I-75 and only a few 100 feet. If they would have gone a few 100 more feet, they would have ended up in a residential area. So, you know, to us, they're the heroes with regard to how they put that plane down.'

JB Pritzker released a parody video announcing the renaming of Lake Michigan to 'Lake Illinois', in a clear jab at President Donald Trump's recent executive order to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Pritzker stated that the proclamation was forwarded to Google, which will update the world's maps to reflect the change. He also mentioned plans to annex Green Bay, a move that could gain Illinois the third-oldest NFL franchise, the Packers. Pritzker's video also referenced Trump's alleged interest in acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal. The U.S. Board on Geographic Names has the power to rename geographic places within the United States, but changes are discouraged unless there is a compelling reason. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has already embraced the change, using the term 'Gulf of America' in a state of emergency declaration. Pritzker said, 'The world's finest geographers, experts who study the Earth's natural environment have concluded a decades-long council and determined that a Great Lake deserves to be named after a great state,' and 'I've also instructed my team to work diligently to prepare for an important announcement next week regarding the Mississippi River,' and 'God Bless America, and Bear Down.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 11:26 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/illinois-governor-trolls-president-trump-232337634.html)\n\n**La Ni\u00f1a is here, and we've got dry weather ahead in South Florida**\nA La Ni\u00f1a climate oscillation has taken hold in January, leading to dry weather in South Florida. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the region will likely experience a drier winter than normal. National Weather Service meteorologist Sammy Hadi stated, 'Unfortunately for all the cold lovers out there, we do have a ridge of high pressure that's now set up across the Gulf of Mexico and South Florida.' This ridge is blocking cold air from the Midwest, resulting in above-average temperatures and morning fog. Hadi added, 'We're going to see above-average temperatures and morning fog continue for the foreseeable future.' Temperatures are expected to rise, with inland areas potentially reaching the upper 80s and close to 90 by midweek next week. The region is currently experiencing moderate drought conditions, which are expected to continue through April.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[SunSentinel](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/07/la-nina-is-here-and-weve-got-dry-weather-ahead-in-south-florida/)\n\n**Traffic won\u2019t be interrupted this weekend as historic ocean liner towing is delayed**\nThe historic SS United States ocean liner will finally leave its home at a South Philadelphia dockyard early Saturday morning after a months-long delay due to concerns about its seaworthiness.

Sheinbaum stated, 'We're going to explain here tomorrow how the seas are composed, what is the continental shelf, what is the economic zone,' during her 'ma\u00f1anera del pueblo' on Wednesday, January 29. Sheinbaum emphasized that a country cannot change the name of a sea, such as the Gulf of Mexico, but rather it is determined by an international organization, the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). The IHO is a group that includes the US and Mexico, and its goal is to 'guarantee that all the seas, oceans, and navigable waters of the world are studied and mapped.' While Trump's decree cannot 'obligate' other countries to recognize the name 'Gulf of America,' the US Board on Geographic Names can establish that denomination as a standard in official US maps. Florida was one of the first states to 'accede' to the name 'Gulf of America,' and even issued a weather alert on January 21, warning of a low-pressure area moving through the 'Gulf of America' and a winter storm approaching the west of the state. Elon Musk, a close associate of Trump, commented, 'Gulf of America' sounds very good.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 03:26 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/2025/01/29/sheinbaum-reclamara-a-google-por-cambiar-nombre-al-golfo-de-mexico/)\n\n**Google says Gulf of Mexico will change to Gulf of America in Maps app: Here's how**\nGoogle Maps will update its name for the 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' once the change is officially updated in the U.S. Geographic Names System.

Google said it will apply the name change when it is updated in official government sources, and will also start using the name 'Mount McKinley' to refer to the mountain in Alaska currently called Denali. The company stated, 'We have a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources.' The Gulf of Mexico is the ninth largest body of water in the world, covering more than 615,000 square miles and bordering Mexico's coast as well as the U.S. southern coast.

In the US, this would happen as soon as the name is updated in the Geographic Names Information System database. 'In the rest of the world, everyone will see both names,' Google added. The US Interior Ministry has announced that it is working quickly to update the official name for the body of water, which will be used on a federal level in the US. This is in line with a decree from President Donald Trump. The name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been used for the body of water since the 16th century. It borders not only the US states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, but also Mexico and Cuba. It is unclear whether the neighboring countries will accept the name change. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had previously said that what is on paper is what matters, not Trump's statements.

According to The Hill, the Coast Guard announced on January 21 that it would deploy more resources to the 'Gulf of America' maritime border between Texas and Mexico, setting a precedent for the federal government to officially use the term. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was the first to use the term 'Gulf of America' in a climate warning, stating that 'due to low pressure crossing the 'Gulf of America' and interacting with Arctic air, a wide range of winter weather will affect northern Florida starting from January 21, 2025.' Trump mentioned in his inauguration speech that 'we will soon rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America and restore the name of the McKinley Mountain, named after the great President McKinley.' Despite controversy surrounding Trump's renaming efforts, his supporters have widely praised the move. Trump has also issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to take 'all necessary measures' to promote the renaming of the Gulf of America within 30 days. Republican Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas tweeted at Apple CEO Tim Cook, urging him to update the map name to 'Gulf of America.' Caitlyn Jenner, a Republican and former Olympic gold medalist, has also jumped on the 'Gulf of America' bandwagon, releasing official T-shirts with the name and stating that 'to celebrate this historic moment, we are releasing the 'Gulf of America Official T-shirt,' with estimated sales expected to break records.'

The reference appeared in an executive order issued by Governor Ron DeSantis on January 20, 2025, declaring a state of emergency due to an unusual winter storm affecting the northern part of the state. According to The Independent, the decision to adopt the new name in an official document occurred even before Trump took formal measures to change the designation at the federal level. The executive order EO 25-13 establishes emergency measures due to a winter system that will bring snow, freezing rain, and temperatures below zero to the Panhandle of Florida from January 21. However, what caught attention was its first clause, in which DeSantis wrote: 'CONSIDERANDO that a low-pressure area moving through the Gulf of America, interacting with Arctic air, will bring a generalized and impactful winter climate to northern Florida from Tuesday, January 21, 2025.' The official document details that snow accumulations of 2.5 to 10 centimeters are expected, with some areas reaching up to 12.5 centimeters in case of intense snowfall. Additionally, a layer of ice of up to 6.3 millimeters is forecast, which could affect roads, bridges, and power grids. The governor ordered the activation of the Florida National Guard, the suspension of state regulations, and the allocation of emergency funds to mitigate the impacts. The name Gulf of Mexico has a long history. According to The Independent, the first documented mention dates back to 1672, when French explorers mapped the region as 'Golphe de Mexique.' In turn, the term comes from the Aztec civilization, whose empire, known as mexica, extended to the coasts of the current gulf. Later, Spanish colonizers called it 'Gulf of New Spain,' before the current name became consolidated. The reference in DeSantis' order came just hours after Trump mentioned his intention to officially change the name in the United States. During his speech, the president stated that the 'Gulf of America' had a 'beautiful sound' and justified his proposal highlighting the economic importance of the region for US trade and maritime industry. The New York Times notes that Trump has yet to issue an executive order to make the change official, but the inclusion of the term in state documents could pressure other government entities to follow suit. The name change is not a unilateral decision. According to experts consulted by The Independent, the designation of seas and oceans is regulated by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), an intergovernmental organization of which both the United States and Mexico are members. Although the US government can modify its internal use in maps and official documents, other countries and international entities are not obligated to adopt the new terminology. To date, the Mexican government has not issued an official response, but the issue could generate diplomatic tensions. The inclusion of the term 'Gulf of America' in DeSantis' order has also sparked criticism within the United States. According to The New York Times, the former first lady and former presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, reacted with an audible laugh when Trump made the announcement in the Capitol. Other analysts consider that the premature use of the term by DeSantis could be a political strategy to strengthen his relationship with the president and his supporters. However, without a federal order, the Gulf of America remains only a reference in a state document, but its inclusion in DeSantis' executive order has already opened the discussion on the scope and implications of the measure. Beyond the controversy, the governor's executive order includes urgent measures to face the impact of the winter storm. Meteorological forecasts indicate the possibility of up to 12.5 centimeters of snow in some areas of the Panhandle, as well as accumulations of ice up to 6.3 millimeters.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 04:06 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/estados-unidos/2025/01/21/para-florida-el-golfo-de-mexico-ya-es-el-golfo-de-america/)\n\n**Florida becomes first state to refer to Gulf of Mexico as 'Gulf of America'**\nFlorida has become the first state to officially refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America', as ordered by President Donald Trump.
