His party, Reform UK, has gained significant momentum, with 4.1 million votes in the 2024 parliamentary elections, despite winning only five seats in the Commons. Farage's party is now the third largest in the UK, and he is seen as a threat to the two main parties, the Conservatives and Labour. The Conservative Party is currently leaderless, with Kemi Badenoch, a Nigerian-born woman, being chosen as their new leader. However, Badenoch has been criticized for her past comments on immigration and her support for removing restrictions on work visas. Farage is now targeting the Conservatives, with a recent poll showing Reform UK with 29% of the vote, ahead of Labour and the Conservatives. The party has also gained significant support in local elections, with over 200,000 members, surpassing the number of Conservative Party members. Farage's goal is to reach 300,000 members, matching the number of Labour Party members. The suspension of local elections due to the fusion of municipalities and census changes has allowed Farage to claim a conspiracy between the two main parties to hinder his party's progress. While it is unlikely that a third party will become the majority in the UK, the current situation is unprecedented, with the Labour Party holding a majority of 411 seats with less than 34% of the national vote. Farage's party has the potential to disrupt the status quo and become a major force in British politics.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 10:56 AM\nSource:[okdiario.com](https://okdiario.com/opinion/farage-vuelve-sacudir-politica-britanica-14266814)\n\n**Candidates share views during advanced polling day**\nCandidates in the upcoming General Election expressed their satisfaction with the number of people who turned out to vote during advanced polling day. Gavin Kennedy, independent candidate for Warwick West, said that 'voters are enthusiastic and our democratic system works'. He called for electoral reforms, including online and absentee voting, and urged people to 'vote with their heart and for the future of this country'. Other candidates, such as Jach\u00e9 Adams of the Progressive Labour Party and Shalleya Codrington of the Free Democratic Movement, also encouraged voters to exercise their democratic right and support candidates who align with their values. Early voters, including Reverend Joseph Morley and Laquita Rocher, shared their concerns about the island's roads and tourism.

However, the party does not have an official leader in Scotland. A party insider has suggested that Nigel Farage, the party's prominent figure, should lead Reform UK in televised debates against John Swinney and Russell Findlay. Glasgow Councillor Thomas Kerr said, 'Nigel's obviously a big figure in us, so the viewpoint that we have in Reform is that once the MSPs are elected, they can then decide amongst themselves who the leader is.' Prof Curtice noted that it would be a 'challenge' for Reform if their representative in TV debates is not a Holyrood candidate, but added that Scotland is becoming a bigger priority for the party.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 12:31 PM\nSource:[The Herald](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/24921443.nigel-farage-front-reform-uks-holyrood-election-campaign/)\n\n**Farage\u2019s Reform UK Surpasses 200,000 Paid Members, Party Rejects Pact with Boris and Tories**\nNigel Farage's Reform UK party has surpassed 200,000 paid members, a milestone achieved just over a month after the party overtook the Tories in terms of paid members. Farage hailed the news as 'an incredible achievement for our party'. According to recent polls, Reform UK is the most popular party in the United Kingdom, with 25% of the vote, ahead of the Labour Party at 24% and the Conservative Party at 21%. Despite previous suggestions of a potential 'mega party' pact with Boris Johnson and the Tories, Reform UK has firmly rejected the idea, stating that they will not work with Johnson or the Conservatives due to their 'betrayal of Brexit' and 'lack of integrity'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 08:59 AM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/02/09/farages-reform-uk-surpasses-200000-paid-members-party-rejects-pact-with-boris-and-tories/)\n\n**Nigel Farage is the biggest reason voters would not back Reform, new poll suggests**\nA new poll by Opinium suggests that Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, is the main reason voters may not support the party, despite its recent surge in popularity. According to the survey, over a quarter (27%) of voters said that Farage was the key reason they would not vote for Reform. The poll also found that voters are generally aware of three things about Reform: it is led by Farage, they do not like immigration, and they are not the Labour or Conservative parties. Adam Drummond, head of political and social research at Opinium, commented, 'Voters generally know about three things about Reform: it's a party led by Nigel Farage, they don't like immigration, and they aren't the Labour or Conservative parties. The first point is what's most likely to drive voters away from the party, the second draws some people towards it, but it's that third point that is Reform's strongest card at the moment.' The poll also found that Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch have low ratings, with Starmer scoring -20% on competence and Badenoch's best attribute being sticking to her principles (+1%).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 08:00 PM\nSource:[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/farage-reform-poll-starmer-badenoch-b2694681.html)\n\n**Top pollster Sir John Curtice says Farage\u2019s Reform challenge is real**\nRenowned polling expert Sir John Curtice has stated that Nigel Farage's Reform UK party's surge in popularity is legitimate and could be sustained until the general election. According to Curtice, the notable trend has been a historic collapse in Labour support after just seven months in power. The assessment is backed up by other leading UK polling experts Lord Robert Hayward and Luke Tryl of More in Common. Curtice noted that Reform's vote is not being significantly overstated, citing council by-election results where Reform won three of the six seats contested. He warned that the challenge is real and much will depend on Reform's funding, ability to create a party machine, and the economy and NHS. Lord Hayward agreed on the direction of travel in the polls but offered a health warning on numbers, stating that the last general election had the most inaccurate polls in history. Mr. Tryl of More In Common agreed that Reform has momentum and is picking up the anti-establishment vote, but questioned whether 25 per cent is a new ceiling and where the remaining Reform votes will come from.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 07:17 PM\nSource:[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/reform-polls-john-curtice-labour-nigel-farage-b2694642.html)\n\n**Reform UK beats Labour in YouGov voter poll for first time**\nNigel Farage's Reform UK party has taken the lead in a YouGov voter poll for the first time, beating Labour with 25% of the vote, compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. Reform UK's joint-highest score to date is up from 23% in the previous poll. Labour dropped three points, while the Lib Dems and Greens remain unchanged. The poll also shows that only 60% of people who voted Labour in July would do so again now, and one in four Conservative voters would now vote Reform. Farage stated, 'Britain wants Reform.' The poll suggests that Reform UK is emerging as a major political force in Britain, with 76 seats potentially won if an election were held now, including 60 currently held by Labour. Hope Not Hate chief executive Nick Lowles called the polling a 'wake-up call for everyone', stating that Reform UK's support comes from a diverse group of voters, including those who are positive towards immigration and multiculturalism.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 09:54 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/reform-uk-labour-yougov-poll-lead-b2691481.html)\n\n**Reform UK overtakes Labour to top national polling for the first time**\nReform UK has overtaken Labour in a national poll for the first time, with 25% of British voters choosing Reform, 24% Labour, and 21% Conservative. Nigel Farage's party has gained two points since the last survey, while Labour has dropped three points. Reform's leader, Nigel Farage, responded to the news with a message saying 'Britain wants Reform'. The poll, conducted by YouGov, also found that nearly one in four who voted Conservative in the election would now back Reform, and that only 60% of people who backed Labour in July would do so now. Reform's success has been attributed to its appeal to 'moderate, interventionist' voters who feel let down by Labour's ability to come through on their policies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 09:20 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14356461/Nigel-Farages-Reform-UK-overtakes-Labour-polling.html)\n\n**Reform UK to take more seats from Labour than Tories, poll shows**\nA recent poll shows that Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, is on course to unseat more Labour MPs than Tories at the next general election. The party is set to win 76 seats, with 60 currently held by Labour, and is just one point behind the Conservatives in the polls. According to Nick Lowles, chief executive of Hope Not Hate, the polling should be a 'wake-up call for everyone' and Labour needs to deliver on its promises to fix Britain's public services and boost living standards to stave off Reform's rise. Mr. Farage has warned that the Tories will 'start to fall quickly' and a swing of just 3 per cent to Reform from both Labour and the Conservatives would see the party jump to 169 seats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 07:31 PM\nSource:[independent.co.uk](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/farage-starmer-reform-labour-tory-poll-b2690715.html)\n\n**Reform UK surge AHEAD of the Tories in new polling**\nA new poll by Survation has shown that Reform UK has surged ahead of the Tories and is now just three points behind Labour. The research found that 24% of voters back Reform UK, up four percentage points from last month, while the Tories slumped to 22% and Labour dropped to 27%. The pollster described this as an 'historic low' due to the electorate being 'fragmented' with disillusioned voters seeking alternatives beyond the two main parties. Reform UK is capitalizing on voter discontent, with 8% of Labour's vote share and 7% of the Lib Dems' vote share moving to Reform. The party is also a bigger threat to the Tories, with 19% of Conservative voters considering backing Reform.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 05:26 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14343115/Reform-UK-surges-AHEAD-Tories-Nigel-Farages-outfit-just-three-points-Labour-support-Britains-two-main-parties-slumps-fresh-low-new-polling-shows.html)\n\n**Reform makes history by surpassing Tories in \u2018key' polling - party set to take EIGHT seats in London**\nReform UK has made history by overtaking the Conservatives in average national polling, according to research by ElectionMapsUK.

Broken down by gender, Reform UK is further ahead, with 31% of men polled backing the party. Find Out Now claims their polling technique is more responsive than other pollsters, who focus on capturing long-term trends rather than real-time snapshots.

The map shows that Reform UK has a strong presence in the east and southeast of England, the West Midlands, and parts of Yorkshire and the Humber, where they recently polled as the biggest party. Reform UK has undergone a dramatic transformation since 2021, weeding out dodgy candidates and setting up local party branches. They recorded 14.3% of the vote share in the July General Election, but only five MPs. However, recent polling has narrowed the gap to Labour and the Tories to just two or three percentage points, with one poll even giving them a small lead over Labour. Reform UK will be desperate to translate this into electoral wins, particularly in the May 2025 local elections, where they will be competing against the Conservatives, who are defending the most wards. As Nigel Farage said, 'when is the first electoral opportunity?' The answer is May 2025, and it will likely come at the expense of the Conservatives.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 21, 2024 08:03 AM\nSource:[gbnews.com](https://www.gbnews.com/politics/reform-farage-elections-2025)\n\n",
