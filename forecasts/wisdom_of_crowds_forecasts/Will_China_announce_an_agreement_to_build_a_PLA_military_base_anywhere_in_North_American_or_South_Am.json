According to the Taiwanese army's social media post, '14 aircraft of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and 5 ships of the PLA Navy, operating around Taiwan, were detected before [1:00 MSK] today [February 9].' It is claimed that 12 of these Chinese aircraft crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, entering the northern, southwestern, and eastern zones of Taiwan's air defense. This comes after Taiwan announced plans to deploy US-supplied air defense systems in the north of the island by the end of the year. China imposed sanctions on US companies Teledyne Brown Engineering Inc, BRINC Drones Inc, and Shield AI Inc on December 3, 2024, in response to the US' preliminary agreement to supply Taiwan with F-16 parts and radar systems, which China saw as a threat to its territorial integrity.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 05:54 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, \u0421\u041d\u0413 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 - \u0418\u0410 REGNUM](https://regnum.ru/news/3946462)\n\n**US Shifts Focus to China's Growing Influence in Latin America and the Caribbean**\nThe United States has shifted its foreign policy focus to China's growing influence in Latin America and the Caribbean, particularly in Cuba, where there have been reports of Chinese espionage and possible military cooperation. The Trump administration, led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has made it clear that it will not allow China's military presence to expand in the region. One of the most concerning issues for Washington is the alleged presence of Chinese spy facilities in Cuban territory, according to analyst Gordon Guthrie Chang. A Wall Street Journal report found that China has been operating signal intercept stations on the island since 2019, which could pose a threat to US national security due to Cuba's proximity to Florida and the concentration of military bases in the southeastern United States. China and Cuba have denied these allegations, calling them 'baseless', but intelligence reports indicate that cooperation between the two countries has strengthened in recent years. The Cuban regime, facing a severe economic crisis and with Russia distracted by the war in Ukraine, has found a key ally in Beijing to sustain itself financially and strategically. Additionally, there have been reports of the two nations discussing the possibility of establishing a joint military training facility, which could involve the presence of Chinese troops just 160 kilometers from the US. In response to these concerns, Secretary of State Rubio initiated his first tour of Central America and the Caribbean, reflecting a clear shift in US foreign policy priorities. During his visit to Panama, Rubio expressed his concern over China's growing influence in the region, urging the Panamanian government to reconsider its relationship with Beijing. As a result, the Panamanian president, Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino, announced that his country would not renew the Belt and Road Initiative agreement with China and could terminate it before its expiration. The US government has made it clear that it will use all diplomatic and economic tools to contain China's expansion in the Western Hemisphere. Although a direct military intervention in Cuba is unlikely, pressure on the Cuban regime is expected to increase in the coming months, according to Chang's analysis. The relationship between China and Cuba, described last year as an 'unbreakable friendship', could be affected if the Trump administration intensifies its efforts to counter China's influence in the region. The relationship between Cuba and China has been the subject of international attention due to reports of Chinese spy facilities in the island and growing military cooperation between the two countries. In December 2024, a US report detailed the existence of Chinese intelligence facilities in Cuba, located in Bejucal, Wajay, Calabazar, and El Salao. These facilities would be equipped with advanced signal intelligence (SIGINT) equipment, raising concerns about regional security. The Cuban government has repeatedly denied these accusations. In July 2024, the regime denied the presence of Chinese spy facilities in its territory, calling the reports 'baseless'. Despite these denials, satellite images published in July 2024 showed an expansion of facilities linked to China in Cuba, including a new construction 70 miles from the US naval base in Guantanamo. Military cooperation between Cuba and China has also been evident. In December 2024, Ra\u00fal Castro and Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel received a Chinese military delegation led by General He Weidong, vice-president of the Central Military Commission of China. During the meeting, both parties expressed their desire to strengthen bilateral military relations. These developments have generated concern in Washington. The US government has expressed its concern over the expansion of Chinese military presence in Cuba and has warned that it is closely monitoring these activities. Despite official denials, the evidence suggests a growing collaboration between Cuba and China in areas of intelligence and defense, which could have significant implications for security in the Western Hemisphere.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 07:09 PM\nSource:[CiberCuba](https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2025-02-08-u1-e207888-s27061-nid296885-estados-unidos-pone-foco-politica-exterior)\n\n**China's PLA Faces Island Chain Challenges, Lacks Invasion Capability**\nAccording to the latest report from the Mainland Affairs Council, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has accelerated modernization and improved its warfighting capabilities since Xi Jinping's military reform in 2015. However, the PLA still faces challenges in joint operations, particularly in the island chain, and lacks the capability to invade Taiwan. The report, which compiled data from the US Department of Defense's 2024 China Military Power Report (CMPR), notes that the PLA has made significant progress in modernization, but still has major flaws, including command and control, logistics, and urban warfare capabilities. The PLA has over 370 ships and submarines, including over 140 main battle surface ships, and more than 1,300 fourth-generation fighter jets, but its joint operations capabilities beyond the first island chain are limited due to institutional problems. The report also notes that Xi Jinping's anti-corruption efforts may disrupt the PLA's modernization process by 2027. Additionally, the PLA has been increasing its focus on Taiwan Strait military emergencies and continues to train for an invasion of Taiwan, while also trying to prevent or deter third-party intervention. The report emphasizes that China is more concerned about US intervention in a Taiwan Strait conflict.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:19 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/acn/202502080074.aspx)\n\n**China Builds Massive Military Command Center, Up to 10 Times Larger Than the Pentagon**\nChina is building a massive military command center in Beijing, which will be up to 10 times larger than the Pentagon, according to the Financial Times. The construction, codenamed 'Beijing Military City', began in mid-2024 and is part of China's military modernization efforts, which include investing in new arms and projects to be implemented by 2027. 'The analysis of images suggests the construction of several possible underground installations connected by possible underground passageways,' said Renny Babiarz, former image analyst at the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, to the Financial Times. The construction is underway despite restrictions on access to the area, with at least 100 cranes operating on a 5 km\u00b2 site to develop the underground infrastructure.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[VEJA](https://veja.abril.com.br/mundo/china-constroi-centro-de-comando-militar-ate-10-vezes-maior-que-pentagono-diz-jornal/)\n\n**China's Growing Presence in Cuba Raises Alarms in the US**\nChina's growing presence in Cuba has raised alarms in the US, with reports indicating the existence of listening stations on the island. According to a June 2023 report by The Wall Street Journal, both countries had agreed to establish a new SIGINT site to collect signal information. While the Biden administration initially dismissed the report as 'inaccurate', they later 'declassified intelligence that showed Chinese-operated signal collection facilities had been operating in Cuba since at least 2019', reported the medium. The CSIS notes that this activity may have begun over a decade ago: 'Rumors about Chinese intelligence presence in the island seem to have started with the visit of Chi', referring to the 1999 visit of Chinese general Chi Haotian to Cuba. R. Evan Ellis, a researcher at the US Army War College, told Gatestone Institute that 'the Chinese may have been involved in this activity since 1993'. Cuba's location, just 160 kilometers south of Florida, makes it a strategic location for monitoring US military communications and activities, highlighted by the CSIS. According to the report, 'the southeastern coast of the US is filled with military bases, command headquarters, space launch sites, and test sites'. In addition to the Soviet-era listening stations in Bejucal (Lourdes and Calabazar), new facilities such as Wajay and El Salao are being built, consolidating China's influence in the region. Beijing denied the Wall Street Journal's claims, calling them 'totally false and unfounded', but other elements of the article suggest that these actions are part of the PLA's Project 141 to expand its global presence. According to the US medium, both countries are negotiating 'to establish a new joint military training facility', which could lead to the deployment of Chinese troops on the island, just miles from US territory. Despite China's denials, underlying tensions reflect a possible balance between interests. While Cuba is facing its worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse, 'the Cuban regime needs Chinese money, and could grant greater access to its territory', argues the CSIS study. However, from Beijing's side, deep economic slowdowns and growing global ambitions may limit its ability to support Havana. The US response has not been passive. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appears to be leading an effort to curb China's expansion in the Caribbean. According to the Wall Street Journal, 'the Biden administration pressed both Havana and Beijing to back down' in negotiations over military sites on the island. In a subsequent interview, a White House official indicated that the US 'will continue to work to interrupt China's presence in Cuba'. In fact, Rubio focused his first official trip as Secretary of State on the Caribbean and Central America region, indicating that this area will be a priority in the Trump administration. In Panama, for example, Rubio questioned the status quo of relations between that country and China, achieving that the Panamanian president Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino announced that he will not renew the memorandum of the Belt and Road Initiative, a key agreement in China's influence over Latin America. 'This status quo is unacceptable', said the spokesperson Tammy Bruce, who added: 'Any delay in immediate changes would require the US to take necessary actions under the Treaty'. The Trump and Rubio strategy, while avoiding military intervention in Cuba, aims to reinforce economic and political pressure. According to The Wall Street Journal, 'China would not be allowed to take control of a country so close to the US'. Meanwhile, the CSIS poses a key question about this Cuban-Chinese alliance: 'Could their cooperation in SIGINT become a platform for a more open military association with Havana?' With a combination of Chinese global ambitions, Cuban financial needs, and an energetic US political response, the balance of power in the Caribbean faces a critical moment. While no additional developments have been confirmed about the alleged listening post, the geopolitical drama between these three nations continues to unfold.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 02:49 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/mundo/2025/02/07/china-refuerza-su-presencia-en-cuba-con-actividades-de-espionaje-y-acuerdos-militares/)\n\n**China Accused of Building Massive Military Complex, 10 Times Larger Than the Pentagon**\nThe US government's intelligence agency accuses China of building a 10 times larger military complex than the Pentagon, west of Beijing. The location would serve as the Chinese government's command center in times of war. According to the Financial Times, US officials have been closely monitoring the site since its construction began in mid-2024. The intelligence analysts investigating the case have dubbed the project the 'Beijing Military City'. Satellite images obtained by the report, currently being examined by the US government, show a construction site of approximately 1,500 acres, about 6,000 square kilometers, 30 km southwest of Beijing. The images reveal that the area has deep holes that, according to military experts, will house reinforced underground bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during any conflict, including potentially a nuclear war. 'If confirmed, this new advanced underground command bunker for military leadership, including President Xi as head of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing's intention to build not only a world-class conventional force, but also an advanced nuclear combat capability', said Dennis Wilder, former China analysis chief for the CIA. The construction is taking place at a time when the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) is developing new weapons and projects in preparation for its centenary in 2027. According to US intelligence, Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the PLA to develop the capability to attack Taiwan. The report notes that, although there was no military presence at the site, warning signs against taking photos or using drones could be seen in the area. One of the guards at the entrance said that entry into the construction site was prohibited. A former high-ranking official of the US intelligence services said that, although the current PLA headquarters in central Beijing was relatively new, it was not designed to be a secure command center. 'The main secure command center of China is located in Western Hills, northeast of the new installations, and was built decades ago, at the height of the Cold War', said the ex-official. 'The size, scale, and partially buried characteristics of the new installation suggest that it will replace the Western Hills complex as the primary wartime command installation'.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 11:22 AM\nSource:[poder360.com.br](https://www.poder360.com.br/poder-internacional/eua-acusam-a-china-de-construir-complexo-de-guerra/)\n\n**China Accused of Building Massive Military Complex in Beijing**\nThe United States accuses China of building a massive military complex in western Beijing, which is believed to be ten times the size of the Pentagon. Satellite images obtained by the Financial Times show a large construction site, approximately 6km\u00b2, 30 km southwest of Beijing. The site features 'deep holes' that will allegedly house reinforced bunkers to protect Chinese military leaders during a potential conflict, including a nuclear war. US officials, both past and present, claim that the intelligence community has been closely monitoring the site, which is expected to be the world's largest military command center. The construction, which began in mid-2024, coincides with the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) development of new weapons and projects near its centenary in 2027. According to US intelligence, President Xi Jinping has ordered the PLA to develop the capability to attack Taiwan by then. 'If confirmed, this advanced underground command bunker for military leadership, including President Xi as head of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing's intention to build not only a conventional world-class force but also an advanced nuclear combat capability,' said Dennis Wilder, former CIA China analysis chief.

Renny Babiarz, a former image analyst at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, noted that at least 100 cranes were working on a 5km\u00b2 area developing underground infrastructure. The site showed 'construction activity' at the beginning of this month, 'in contrast to the scarcity of development in most large real estate projects in China, which was hit by a housing crisis,' according to the Financial Times.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 10:19 AM\nSource:[folhape.com.br](https://www.folhape.com.br/noticias/eua-acusam-a-china-de-estar-construindo-complexo-de-guerra-com-dez/390046/)\n\n**Conflict Inevitable: US and China Prepare for Forceful Confrontation**\nThe United States is actively rebuilding its military infrastructure in the Pacific region, adapting to the growing threat from China. The focus is on the remote island of Tinian, where the North Field airbase was located, from which American bombers dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. After World War II, the strategic importance of this facility decreased, but recent satellite images show that the island is being cleared and its infrastructure is being restored. The reason for the Pentagon's renewed interest in abandoned airbases is the development of China's military potential. China has significantly modernized its arsenal, including medium-range missiles that can hit American bases on the second island chain. In response, the US is implementing a 'hub and spokes' strategy, which involves dispersing military resources, allowing aircraft to quickly move between auxiliary bases in case of a threat. This approach would make it difficult for Chinese missiles to hit key targets. At the same time, China is expanding its military capabilities, increasing the pace of building new ships, including those for amphibious operations. These measures are causing concern in Taiwan, which is activating diplomatic contacts in the region, fearing an escalation of tensions. Satellite images also show a significant expansion of China's naval base on Hainan Island, which is increasing US concerns about the balance of power in the Pacific. Washington has begun large-scale work on restoring military airfields in the region, including Tinian, Guam, Peleliu, and other islands. The US is also increasing its military presence in the Philippines, directing millions of dollars to develop the infrastructure of the Basa airbase. In Australia, American contingents are being strengthened, and local military bases can serve as reserve airfields. However, the restoration of military infrastructure is not only facing technical but also political difficulties. Many regional states, including Palau, Micronesia, and the Marshall Islands, are reluctant to agree to the construction of new military facilities, fearing the consequences of a possible conflict. Some projects are causing protests from local residents, and China's active economic cooperation with island states is increasing its influence. Furthermore, the rapid growth of China's military potential, particularly the development of hypersonic missiles DF-17 and ballistic missiles DF-26, poses a significant threat to American bases in the Pacific. According to Pentagon estimates, the number of DF-26 missiles, known as 'Guam killers,' has significantly increased in recent years, creating a risk of destroying up to 90% of US aviation on the ground in case of a conflict. This forces Washington to urgently adapt its defense, focusing on the distribution of forces and the strengthening of anti-missile defense. Thus, the restoration work on Tinian and other islands is only part of a global review of the US military strategy in the Pacific. However, despite the active actions of the Pentagon, uncertainty remains about the position of regional states, many of which do not want to become the arena of confrontation between world powers. In the face of growing tensions, the Asia-Pacific region has become a key geopolitical node that will determine the balance of power in the coming decades.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 06:47 AM\nSource:[topwar.ru](https://topcor.ru/56331-konflikt-neizbezhen-ssha-i-kitaj-gotovjatsja-k-silovomu-protivostojaniju.html)\n\n**Bolsonaro Announces Plans to Withdraw Brazil from International Organizations and Establish US Military Base**\nFormer Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro stated that if he were to return to power, he would follow in the footsteps of Donald Trump and withdraw Brazil from various international organizations.

According to the Financial Times, the construction of the facility has raised concerns among Western intelligence agencies, who believe that Beijing may be preparing for a large-scale conflict. The newspaper reported that recent satellite images indicate that the project occupies an area of 1,500 acres, located about 30 kilometers southwest of the Chinese capital. The images show approximately 100 cranes operating in a five-kilometer square area. Military experts point out that the facility may include fortified bunkers designed to protect Communist Party of China (CPC) leaders in the event of war. According to the report, construction began in mid-2024. Intelligence analysts have dubbed the project the 'Beijing Military City', highlighting that it will be the world's largest military command center. Financial Times reporters attempted to approach the site but were blocked by security. A local merchant stated that the area is military. The release of this information coincided with US President Donald Trump's announcement of the development of a next-generation antimissile defense shield. Trump stated that the system will be designed to protect the continental US territory against hypersonic missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), with expanded coverage compared to the Iron Dome system used by Israel.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 11:02 AM\nSource:[ocafezinho.com](https://www.ocafezinho.com/2025/02/04/china-constroi-centro-de-comando-militar-maior-que-o-pentagono/)\n\n**World News | Readying for War, the PLA Burrows Underground and Hardens Air Bases | LatestLY**\nChina is preparing for war by building a massive underground command center near Beijing, which will be the world's largest military command center. The facility, currently under construction, will be a 'doomsday bunker' for China, with modern digital and communication systems integrated into the facility from the beginning. The complex will oversee every aspect of the PLA's activities, especially control of combat forces in wartime. China is also expanding its nuclear warfighting capability, with over 600 operational nuclear warheads and plans to have 1,000 by 2030. The PLA has been busily constructing hardened shelters to protect aircraft and equipment across numerous air bases, with more than 3,000 total aircraft shelters. This proliferation of hardened shelters is enough to house and hide the vast majority of Chinese combat aircraft. The PLA expects airfields to come under heavy attack in a potential conflict and has made major investments to defend, expand and fortify them. 'It appears that China is not planning on relying on future nuclear weapons tests, but rather developing and fielding new and more sophisticated nuclear weapon designs, including more miniaturized warheads,' said Decker Eveleth, a researcher at the US-based research organization CNA Corp. 'This creates an imbalance in which PLA forces would need to fire far fewer 'shots' to suppress or destroy US, allied and partner airfields than the converse,' said Thomas H. Shugart and Timothy A. Walton, authors of the Hudson Institute report 'Concrete Sky: Air Base Hardening in the Western Pacific'.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 04:35 AM\nSource:[LatestLY](https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/world-news-readying-for-war-the-pla-burrows-underground-and-hardens-air-bases-6616526.html)\n\n**Readying for war, the PLA burrows underground and hardens air bases**\nChina is preparing for war by building a massive underground command center near Beijing, which will be the world's largest military command center.

The PLA is also hardening air bases and constructing hardened shelters to protect aircraft and equipment. China has more than doubled its hardened aircraft shelters and unhardened individual aircraft shelters at military airfields, giving it more than 3,000 total aircraft shelters. The PLA has also added 20 runways and more than 40 runway-length taxiways, and increased its ramp area nationwide by almost 75%. The US has added just two HASs, 41 IASs, one runway, one taxiway and 17% more ramp area in an area within 1,000nm of Taiwan. The PLA is expected to have air dominance in a potential conflict with Taiwan, and has been developing the ability to paralyze enemy air forces while they are still on the ground. China can hold the USA under serious threat of bombardment, and the signs are worrying. The PLA is burrowing underground and hardening facilities above ground in readiness for conflict with an adversary like the USA.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 04:27 AM\nSource:[Asian News International (ANI)](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/readying-for-war-the-pla-burrows-underground-and-hardens-air-bases20250204095522/)\n\n**China's 'Pekin Asker \u015eehri' Project: A Potential Nuclear War Command Center**\nChina's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is building a new military base near Beijing, which could serve as a command center for a potential nuclear war.

The US National Intelligence Director declined to comment on the project, while the Chinese embassy in Washington said it was not aware of the details and that China is committed to peaceful development and defense policies. An expert on China, Renny Babiarz, said that the satellite images suggest that the base will have at least 100 underground facilities and could be used as an education center. However, a former high-ranking US intelligence official said that the base is likely to be used as a primary command center in the event of a war and could provide greater security against US-made bunker-busting munitions and even nuclear weapons.

The project is part of China's rapid modernization of its military, coinciding with the centenary of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 2027. According to US intelligence sources, Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered the PLA to have the capability to attack Taiwan by that date. The new command center is designed to replace the current complex at the Western Hills, which was built during the Cold War and may not offer the same level of protection against modern penetrating bunker-busting bombs or nuclear strategic attacks. The construction of the new center began in mid-2024 and is expected to be completed soon. The project is seen as a sign of China's growing military capabilities and its increasing influence in the Indo-Pacific region, which has raised tensions with the US. China's military spending has increased by 60% in the last 10 years, and the country is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal and improving the integration of its different military branches. The US has expressed concerns about China's growing military capabilities and its increasing cooperation with Russia, which has provided China with sensitive military technologies. The new command center is expected to be a key component of China's military modernization and its ability to project power in the region.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 11:06 AM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/economia/noticias/13198187/01/25/china-se-prepara-para-lo-peor-pekin-construye-un-centro-militar-para-tiempos-de-guerra-diez-vez-mas-grande-que-el-pentagono-de-eeuu.html)\n\n**China Builds Massive Military Complex, Raising Concerns About Nuclear War Capabilities**\nAccording to the Financial Times, a massive military complex is being built on the outskirts of Beijing, which is expected to be ten times larger than the Pentagon. The complex is believed to be a command center for war and will be located about 30 kilometers south of the capital. The construction of the complex began in the middle of last year and is expected to cover an area of 1500 acres and stretch over 4 kilometers. Although no military personnel have been spotted in the area, the terrain does not resemble typical commercial development projects. The local authorities have banned photography and drone flights in the area, and a local shopkeeper described the area as 'military territory'. Analysts believe that the complex has all the characteristics of a key military facility, including reinforced concrete structures and deep underground tunnels. 'If this is confirmed, the new advanced underground command bunker for the military leadership, including Xi Jinping as the chairman of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing's intention to build not only conventional world-class forces, but also advanced nuclear war capabilities,' said Dennis Wilder, a former CIA analyst. 'Chinese leaders may think that the new facility will provide greater safety from American penetrating ammunition and even nuclear weapons,' said an anonymous former intelligence official. A former high-ranking US intelligence official also noted that while the current headquarters of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in central Beijing is relatively new, it was not designed as a safe command center. The construction of the new complex coincides with the PLA's development of new types of weapons and other projects ahead of the 2027 centennial of the PLA's founding. The US intelligence believes that Xi has ordered the PLA to achieve the ability to attack Taiwan by that time. In China, at least five massive, special ships are being built, which appear to be designed for large-scale amphibious landings. As the first to report this, American expert H.I. Sutton cited satellite images from Chinese shipyards. The new vessels would be particularly useful for Beijing in the event of a military landing on Taiwan. Satellite images show at least five, and possibly more, massive and unusual ships with lengths of 110 to 185 meters. They were spotted in a shipyard on the Longxue Island in Guangzhou in southern China.'\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 10:34 AM\nSource:[TVN24](https://tvn24.pl/swiat/chiny-powstaje-wojskowe-centrum-dowodzenia-pod-pekinem-ma-byc-dziesiec-razy-wieksze-od-pentagonu-st8286370)\n\n**Satellite images reveal China building war command center in Beijing**\nSatellite images obtained by The Financial Times reveal that China is building a large wartime military complex in Beijing, with US officials suspecting it will replace the Western Hills complex as China's primary wartime command center. The 1,500-acre construction site, which began in mid-2024, is believed to hold bunkers to protect Chinese leaders during a conflict. Former analyst Renny Babiarz said, 'Imagery analysis suggests the construction of several possible underground facilities linked via possible underground passageways.' However, some experts question the purpose of the site, with researcher Hsu Yen-chi saying, 'It can only be assumed that it is a site for an administrative organization or a large training base.' The news comes ahead of China's 2027 short-term military modernization goal, with US officials saying that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has instructed the PLA to develop the ability to attack Taiwan by then.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 09:40 AM\nSource:[taiwannews.com.tw](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/6026960)\n\n**China Builds Massive Exhibition Command Center in Beijing**\nAccording to a report by the Financial Times (FT), China is building a massive exhibition command center in Beijing, which is expected to be the largest military command center in the world. The facility, which covers an area of 6 square kilometers, is being built in the western part of Beijing, about 30 kilometers southwest of the city center. The project is believed to be a response to the US Pentagon's presence in the region, with some experts suggesting that it may be a 'Beijing Military City.' The facility is expected to serve as a command center for China's military leaders during times of conflict, including nuclear war. According to satellite images, the construction of the facility began in mid-2023 and is expected to be completed by 2027, which coincides with the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The project is seen as a sign of China's growing military capabilities, including its development of nuclear weapons and its efforts to integrate its various military organizations. 'This is a signal that China is building up its conventional and nuclear warfighting capabilities,' said Dennis Wilder, a former CIA analyst and White House Asia policy coordinator. However, some experts have raised questions about the suitability of the site for a underground bunker.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 09:29 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/world/11229776)\n\n**China May Build New Military Command Center in Beijing, FT Reports**\nAccording to Financical Times (FT), satellite images analyzed by American intelligence show a large construction project in 30 kilometers southwest of Beijing, covering an area of approximately 1500 acres. Analysts believe this could be a site for building large underground bunkers to protect the top leadership of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in case of conflict, particularly in the event of a nuclear attack. Several current and former US government officials stated that intelligence is closely monitoring the site, which is likely to become the world's largest military command center, surpassing the Pentagon in size by at least ten times. The construction began in mid-2024, according to satellite image analysis. This project is taking place during a period when the PLA is working on developing new weapons and military projects ahead of its 100th anniversary in 2027. According to American intelligence estimates, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has set a goal for the army to develop military capabilities sufficient for a potential attack on Taiwan before that deadline. The PLA is also actively increasing its nuclear warhead stockpile and focusing on improving coordination between its various military branches. As stated by Dennis Wilder, former head of the China analysis department at the CIA, 'If confirmed, this new advanced underground command bunker for military leadership, including President Xi as chairman of the Central Military Commission, signals Beijing's intention to create not only world-class conventional forces but also advanced nuclear war capabilities.' A former US intelligence official told FT that the PLA's main headquarters in central Beijing is not sufficiently fortified to serve as a command center in wartime.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/bilshiy-pentagon-kitay-mozhe-buduvati-noviy-1738312544.html)\n\n**China Building Massive Military Command Center in Beijing, Report Suggests**\nAccording to a report by the Financial Times, citing several US former and current officials, there are indications that China is building a massive military command center in Beijing, which could be the largest in the world, ten times the size of the Pentagon. The US intelligence community is evaluating satellite images of the construction site, which shows several deep holes that could be used to house large, solid shelters, including those for military leaders during a nuclear war. The officials stated that the main construction work began around mid-2023. A former CIA China analyst, Dennis Wilder, said that if confirmed, the new building would reveal that Beijing not only wants to build a world-class conventional force, but also to establish advanced nuclear capabilities. Renny Babiarz, a former image analyst at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, said that according to the satellite images, the underground infrastructure project has used at least 100 cranes, and there may be interconnected underground tunnels between them. A former senior US intelligence official stated that the new facility could replace the existing one in the western mountains, which was built during the Cold War era, and would provide China's leaders with enhanced 'bunker-busting' capabilities and nuclear strike defenses. The official also noted that the new facility may use more advanced and secure communication systems, and would allow the PLA to expand its operations and capabilities.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 07:50 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7331/8520516)\n\n**China: War in Two Years or Less**\nChina's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is preparing for a potential invasion of Taiwan by 2027, as indicated by satellite photos showing mobile harbors being built in southern China. Former U.S. Indo-Pacific Command chief Adm. Phil Davidson warned in 2021 that China is accelerating its ambitions to supplant the U.S. and that Taiwan is a key target before 2027. The PLA has been making significant strides in modernizing its navy and air force, and has publicly stated its goal of achieving 'greater strength and self-reliance in science and technology' by 2027. As CDR Sal noted, 'Yes, the demographics of 2027. Yes, the passing intersection of military and economic power ~2027,' warning that war is likely to break out in the next six years.

This move is seen as a strategic shift in the region, as the US will gain influence in the Pacific South, while the UK maintains control of the South Atlantic through the Falkland Islands. The US is also using China's growing commercial ties in the region to justify a larger military presence. The recent inauguration of the Chancay port in Peru, a key hub in the Pacific, has fueled US suspicions and concerns. The US is expected to expand its presence in the region, with General Richardson potentially being appointed as a liaison with South America under a future Republican administration. The US military is also taking note of China's advancements in the region and is orienting itself towards defending Paraguay, the only US ally in South America and a supposed victim of a Chinese cyber attack.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 03:41 AM\nSource:[P\u00e1gina/12](https://www.pagina12.com.ar/791169-ushuaia-un-nuevo-polo-de-disputa-internacional)\n\n",
