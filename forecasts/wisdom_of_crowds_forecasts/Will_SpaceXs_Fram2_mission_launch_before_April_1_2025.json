Scientists believe these craters are filled with tons of ice, which can be converted by future astronauts into drinking water, breathable air, and even fuel for rockets. If successful, it will be the second time a SpaceX spacecraft has landed on the Moon, following the Odysseus mission, which landed smoothly on February 22, 2024. According to NASA, the mission will search for water and other volatile substances on the lunar surface. As explained by NASA, the mission is crucial for the Artemis program and a program aimed at preparing future human missions to the Moon and Mars. One of the main goals of IM-2 is to demonstrate the extraction and use of resources found on the Moon. The mission will deploy a drill and a mass spectrometer to analyze the possible presence of gases and volatiles in the lunar soil in Mons Mouton. Additionally, a passive laser reflector will be installed as a permanent reference point for future missions. Other technologies on board the module include a surface communication system and a motorized drone capable of moving across the lunar terrain through short jumps. Along with the IM-2 mission, NASA will also launch a probe that will enter lunar orbit to map the distribution of water on the surface. NASA plans to send astronauts back to the Moon's surface in 2026, including the first woman and the first African American, in another expedition to the south pole region, where frozen water is expected to exist.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 27, 2025 04:14 AM\nSource:[SAPO](https://www.sapo.pt/noticias/economia/empresa-privada-dos-estados-unidos-lanca_67bfe1e8c5200e7493b01b5c)\n\n**Watch: SpaceX launches third Moon mission of 2025 with Athena lander aboard Falcon 9 - The Times of India**\nSpaceX successfully launched its third Moon landing mission of 2025, IM-2, carrying the Athena lander atop a Falcon 9 rocket.

The mission aims to search for water ice in the lunar south pole, a region rich in resources, which could be suitable for the Artemis program and even the construction of a lunar base in the coming years. 'This area seems to be rich in resources due to the permanently shaded craters,' explains Pierre-Yves Meslin, a planetary researcher at the IRAP. 'This environment is ideal for trapping volatile elements like hydrogen, which could be present in large quantities.' The IM-2 mission is equipped with a drill called Trident, which will dig 1 meter deep, and a mass spectrometer, MSolo, designed to analyze the composition of the sample and find water ice. Casey Honniball, a NASA researcher, hopes that IM-2 will help to lift some of the uncertainties about the Moon: 'There are enormous uncertainties about the Moon. We are particularly interested in water, but we do not know how much it is present, if it is on the surface or in the soil, or how it is distributed across the Moon.' However, IM-2 faces several challenges, including the limitations of its spectrometer and the fragility of water ice, which risks sublimating during the drilling operation.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 26, 2025 06:05 PM\nSource:[Le Monde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/26/la-nasa-part-a-la-recherche-de-l-eau-de-la-lune-a-l-aide-d-une-mission-privee_6565589_1650684.html)\n\n**SpaceX Falcon 9 launch Aims for the Moon and Beyond**\nA SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to launch from Kennedy Space Center on February 26, carrying multiple payloads, including lunar-bound hardware and asteroid mining technology.

SpaceX is planning to conduct another test flight of its massive Starship vehicle in early January, with the goal of reusing the booster and releasing some Starlink satellites. The reusability and high cargo capacity of the Starship represent the main strengths for drastically reducing launch costs. After this test, SpaceX plans an even more ambitious flight, aimed at demonstrating the ability to transfer propellant between two Starship vehicles in Earth orbit, a crucial step for testing the ability to use this spacecraft in future missions to the Moon and Mars. Blue Origin, on the other hand, will launch its orbital rocket New Glenn in January, which will become the primary launch vehicle for the over 3,000 satellites of the Kuiper internet constellation of Amazon. The entry of Blue Origin into the heavy launcher market will consolidate the role of Jeff Bezos' company as a direct competitor to SpaceX. The European Space Agency (ESA) will also be a protagonist in 2025 with the launch of the Space Rider, scheduled for the third quarter. This spacecraft will spend two months in Earth orbit, during which it will automatically conduct technological demonstrations and experiments in microgravity conditions. At the end of the mission, the Space Rider will return to Earth, landing on a runway at the European spaceport in French Guiana. Designed by the ESA, the spacecraft can be reused for at least five flights and represents an important step towards continuous and cost-effective access to Earth orbit. Human space exploration will continue to play a central role in 2025, with SpaceX launching a new commercial mission with the Crew Dragon capsule. The mission, known as FRAM2, will take four private explorers to a polar orbit, a trajectory never before traversed by crewed vehicles. The mission will be led by polar explorer Chun Wang and will include filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, polar explorer Eric Philips, and engineer/scientist Rabea Rogge. Axiom Space will continue its commercial missions to the International Space Station (ISS) in the coming months, with Axiom-4, the fourth crewed mission, using the Crew Dragon to take four astronauts to the ISS, where they will spend a decade conducting various scientific experiments. This mission represents another step towards the realization of the AxStation, a private space station initially connected to the ISS but destined to operate autonomously. The space station could host both private and institutional activities and represent the future of orbital exploration after 2030, when the ISS will be decommissioned. 2025 will also be a year of direct ventures beyond Earth's orbit, with Firefly Aerospace launching the Ghost Riders in the Sky mission in January, designed to land an automatic vehicle that carries a decade of NASA experiments on the Moon. The landing is expected in a region formed by ancient volcanic eruptions dating back over three billion years. The Blue Ghost 1 lander will operate for an entire lunar day (about 14 Earth days), collecting data on the lunar surface and the interaction with the solar wind, the flow of charged particles emitted by the Sun. In February, it will be the turn of the automatic Intuitive Machines-2 (IM-2) mission, which will continue the work of the previous IM-1. Despite the rollover that occurred at the time of landing, IM-1 represented the first lunar landing of a spacecraft built by a private company. IM-2 will also land at the South Pole, carrying a drill and a mass spectrometer to examine the composition of the lunar subsurface. The mission also includes the release of the small Lunar Trailblazer satellite, designed to remain in orbit and map the deposits of water ice present at the South Pole lunar. These data will be fundamental for NASA in planning future Artemis missions, which will return astronauts to the Moon over half a century after the successes of the Apollo program.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 06, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[HuffPost Italia](https://www.huffingtonpost.it/blog/2025/01/06/news/dal_web_alle_stelle_musk_vs_bezos_sfida_spaziale_del_2025-18121224/)\n\n**German Astronaut Rabea Rogge Trains for Historic Space Mission**\nGerman researcher Rabea Rogge is preparing for her spaceflight as part of the 'Fram2' mission, which is scheduled for spring 2025.
