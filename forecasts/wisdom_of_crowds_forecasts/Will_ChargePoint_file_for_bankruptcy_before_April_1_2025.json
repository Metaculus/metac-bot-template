The company, which was once a rising star on Wall Street, was involved in a scandal and its founder was convicted in 2022 of deceiving investors about the company's capabilities. Nikola had aimed to revolutionize the truck market with hydrogen or electric-powered vehicles that could travel 2,000 km on a single charge. However, the reality hit hard in 2024, with the company selling only 200 units and its stock price dropping 45%. The company plans to continue providing service and support for its vehicles on the road, including HYLA fueling operations until the end of March, subject to court approval. Stevie Girsky, Nikola's president and CEO, explained that the measure comes after months of searching for other solutions. The company has $47 million in cash to finance its activities. 'We are taking this step after months of exploring other options,' Girsky said. Nikola, named after the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla, emerged in 2014 as an innovative automaker that would produce trucks powered by electricity or hydrogen, with the goal of achieving zero emissions in the heavy transportation sector. The company's performance figures were impressive, with a 2,000 CV truck that could go from 0 to 100 km/h in 30 seconds and maintain that speed on a 6% incline with a full load. However, the company has struggled to deliver on its promises, and its founder was eventually convicted of deceiving investors. The company's latest model, the TRE, was supposed to be released in 2023, but it has yet to be manufactured.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 11:27 PM\nSource:[Iprofesional.com](https://www.iprofesional.com/autos/423037-se-declaro-en-quiebra-automotriz-que-llego-valer-mas-que-ford)\n\n**Nikola Files for Bankruptcy and Plans to Sell Assets**\nNikola, a US-based automaker that once valued more than Ford, has filed for bankruptcy and plans to sell its assets.

Nikola's president and CEO, Steve Girsky, explained in a statement that the measure comes after months of searching for other solutions. The company's goal was to make the transportation of heavy goods emission-free, and it was so successful that it even surpassed the value of Ford. However, the company's performance was marred by a scandal, and it has been struggling to deliver on its promises.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 09:22 PM\nSource:[Clarin](https://www.clarin.com/internacional/declaro-quiebra-empresa-automotriz-llego-valer-ford-pasara-futuro_0_yGjAQhUOsq.html)\n\n**Nikola Files for Bankruptcy Protection Amid Market and Macroeconomic Challenges**\nNikola, an electric vehicle manufacturer, has filed for bankruptcy protection. The company, once a rising star on Wall Street, was embroiled in a scandal and its founder was convicted in 2022 of deceiving investors about the company's capabilities. Nikola, based in Arizona, filed the petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and said on Wednesday that it has also filed a motion seeking approval to conduct a sale and auction of the business. 'Like other electric vehicle companies, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,' said CEO Steve Girsky in a statement. Girsky noted that the company has made efforts in recent months to raise funds, reduce liabilities and preserve cash, but that it has not been enough. 'The Board has determined that Chapter 11 (filing for bankruptcy protection) represents the best possible course of action under the circumstances for the company and its stakeholders,' he explained. In December 2023, founder Trevor Milton was sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of exaggerating claims about the production of 18-wheel trucks that could run without emitting gas, resulting in significant losses for investors. Milton was convicted of fraud charges after prosecutors portrayed him as a scammer after founding his company in a Utah basement six years earlier.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 08:12 PM\nSource:[Vanguardia](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/internacional/nikola-fabricante-de-vehiculos-electricos-se-declara-en-bancarrota-LA15044924)\n\n**Beta Technologies' bet on electric flight and Hyundai's new Tesla charging port comes up short | TechCrunch**\nThis week in mobility, several companies faced setbacks, including Nikola, which filed for bankruptcy, and Getaround, which shut down its US operations. Turo also called off its IPO. On the other hand, Aurora raised $500 million in stock, Fetii raised $7.35 million in seed funding, and Saronic raised $600 million in funding at a $4 billion valuation. Additionally, Waymo may launch a membership program, and Serve Robotics launched its delivery bots in Miami. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency has turned some consumers against Tesla, leading to protests at Tesla showrooms. Beta Technologies, a quiet player in the electric aviation industry, has been growing its business and collecting more piloted flight hours than anyone else. Finally, Hyundai's new 2025 Ioniq 5 has a charging port that doesn't match up with the Tesla Supercharger cord, requiring users to wait for another Tesla to vacate its space or use a CCS-equipped charging station.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 07:17 PM\nSource:[TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/20/beta-technologiess-bet-on-electric-flight-and-hyundais-new-tesla-charging-port-comes-up-short/)\n\n**Nikola, the Electric Truck Maker, Files for Bankruptcy**\nNikola, the American electric truck manufacturer, has filed for bankruptcy. According to Bloomberg, the company was struggling with 'poor sales', had 'seen several CEOs come and go in the wake of a fraud scandal', and was facing a debt of '$98 million [approximately \u20ac93 million]'. The company was also experiencing financial difficulties due to 'slowing sales and the collapse of its stock price', as reported by Bloomberg. Nikola is the latest company to 'succumb to the particularly difficult environment for electric vehicles', which have lost favor with the public due to their high costs and inadequate charging systems in the US. As The Wall Street Journal notes, 'another green energy unicorn has died', and this 'spectacular stock market collapse serves as a new warning about the dangers of industrial policy and public subsidy chases'. Nikola had entered the stock market in 2020, 'dreaming of becoming the Tesla of trucks', on the back of 'post-pandemic market euphoria and promises of the 'Green New Deal' from the Biden presidency. It had even reached a valuation of '$27 billion [approximately \u20ac25 billion], higher than that of Ford at the same time', without having sold any vehicles, as the liberal newspaper editorial notes. The company had previously been involved in a scandal, including faking a test of its truck, and had to recall 209 electric trucks in 2023 due to fire risks. By October 2024, 'the company had sold less than 500 trucks, accumulating significant losses'. Nikola was selling 'hydrogen trucks for $351,000 [\u20ac335,000], roughly half of what it cost to produce them'. This situation 'was not financially viable, especially in a context of rising interest rates', as the economic newspaper judged, despite government subsidies for electric vehicle buyers.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 04:42 PM\nSource:[Courrier international](https://www.courrierinternational.com/article/etats-unis-nikola-le-tesla-du-poids-lourd-se-prend-le-mur-de-la-faillite_227986)\n\n**Hotelbreak Closes: Recommendations for Consumers in the Balearic Islands**\nThe General Directorate of Benefits, Pharmacy and Consumption has issued recommendations after the announcement of the company that manages the Hotelbreak platform to cease its activity. These recommendations include keeping all documentation, such as invoices, orders, payment receipts, or emails, and advising users to file a complaint with the responsible company. The Conselleria de Salud has warned users of this online platform, through which hotel experiences, spa routes, restaurant meals, or facility use can be booked, that they have received cancellation notices for the services contracted. This is because Hotelbreak had charged users for the service but not paid the establishment. Others claim that they cannot use the money in their wallet with the company. In all cases, affected individuals have tried to contact the company without success. If the purchase was made with a credit card, it is recommended to contact the financial institution to inquire about the possibility of canceling the charge. For more information, users can contact the General Directorate of Benefits, Pharmacy and Consumption to inform themselves of their rights as consumers or how to file a complaint or denounce. According to the General Directorate, if Hotelbreak requests a bankruptcy proceeding and it is accepted, a notice will be published in the BOE announcing the company's declaration of bankruptcy. At the same time, a concursal administrator will be appointed, who will be responsible for managing the company during the bankruptcy procedure. Affected individuals will have one month from the publication of the notice to present all their claims to the appointed administrator. Additionally, affected individuals can also file a lawsuit in court, although it is recommended to first file a complaint with the company. It is necessary to have the assistance of a lawyer and procurator to direct the procedure. However, if the amount of the claim does not exceed 2,000 euros and in the cases provided for in the applicable legislation, the citizen can file a lawsuit without the assistance of a lawyer and procurator.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 04:37 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/illes-balears/noticia-crisis-hotelbreak-consumo-recomienda-guardar-documentacion-reclamar-20250220163813.html)\n\n**Nikola, a once-hyped EV-maker, has gone bankrupt**\nNikola, a once-hyped electric vehicle (EV) maker, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company, which reached a peak market cap of ~$27 billion in 2020, struggled from the moment it went public without having sold a single truck. It faced allegations of overstating its technology and was forced to recall its vehicles due to fire incidents. CEO Steve Girsky warned in Q3 2024 that the company didn't have enough cash to make it through the first quarter of 2025. Nikola joins fellow EV-makers Fisker Automotive, Electric Last Mile Solutions, and Lordstown Motors, all of which went bankrupt in the last three years. The electric vehicle environment has become tougher due to high costs, waning demand, and weak charging infrastructure, even blue-chip auto companies have pulled back on their EV promises.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 05:03 AM\nSource:[Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrew.com/stories/2025/02/20/nikola-a-once-hyped-ev-maker-has-gone-bankrupt)\n\n**Nikola Files for Bankruptcy and Plans to Sell Remaining Business**\nNikola, the electric truck manufacturer, has filed for bankruptcy protection under US law (Chapter 11) and is planning to sell the remaining business as quickly as possible. The company's CEO, Steve Girsky, cited 'market and overall economic factors' as the reason for the bankruptcy, stating, 'Unfortunately, all our efforts have not been enough to overcome these challenges.' The company has accumulated massive debts, with court documents showing billions of dollars in liabilities. Nikola had started with battery-powered trucks but shifted to larger fuel cell trucks with hydrogen propulsion. However, with each sold truck, the company made hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses. The company's liquidity had decreased to $198 million by the end of September, down from over $400 million at the end of 2023. The weak demand due to skepticism from many shippers and the sparse network of electric charging stations and hydrogen refueling stations led to a rapid decline in cash reserves. The company still has cash reserves of $47 million and plans to maintain certain services for the trucks until the end of March. Since its IPO in June 2020, the stock has lost 99% of its value, and on Wednesday, it fell by a further 45% to 41 US cents. Nikola is not the first US electric vehicle manufacturer to go bankrupt, with Fisker, Proterra, and Lordstown Motors having previously done so.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:08 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/E-Lkw-Bauer-Nikola-ist-endgueltig-am-Ende-article25574985.html)\n\n**Foley Automotive Update**\nFoley & Lardner LLP has provided analysis on the impact of President Trump's tariff policies on the automotive industry. The firm's partners, including Greg Husisian and Vanessa Miller, have commented on the potential ramifications of the tariffs, including higher manufacturing costs and job losses in the U.S. Major automakers are increasing their lobbying efforts to address concerns over the tariffs. Ford has delayed the launch of its next-generation F-150 pickup truck, and the company has projected a decline in its 2025 operating profit due to challenges such as pricing competitiveness and lower sales volumes. The U.S. market share and production of certain overseas automakers could be affected by new import tariffs. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation has expressed its support for the nomination of Jonathan Morrison to serve as Administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A Rhode Island federal judge has ruled that substantive effects have persisted for the now-rescinded January 27 Office of Management and Budget memorandum that called for a freeze on certain federal grants, loans, and other financial assistance. Automakers are lobbying the Trump administration to pursue a gradual phaseout of certain EV tax credits rather than an abrupt end. A Massachusetts federal judge has ruled against automakers that sought to block implementation of the state's 'right-to-repair' law. BYD is pursuing discussions to sell European automakers carbon credits to help mitigate the effects of stricter emissions standards in the European Union. The Trump administration has agreed to pause additional layoffs at the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, according to a February 14 court order. BYD will include advanced driver-assistance systems as a standard feature in many of its future models sold in China at no additional cost to buyers. GM has announced a goal for its Super Cruise hands-free driver-assist system to reach $2 billion in annual revenue within five years. J.D. Power predicts 2025 U.S. EV market share will hold at 9.1%, to match last year's sales levels of 1.2 million units. Toyota plans to begin shipping batteries for North American electrified vehicles from its Battery Manufacturing North Carolina plant in April 2025. Electric truck maker Nikola has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Automaker-backed EV charging company Ionna plans to continue adding infrastructure at pace without relying on NEVI funding, with a priority on hubs around cities to serve drivers that are not able to install a home charger. Rivian's electric van is now available for purchase by any entities with a fleet of commercial vehicles.

Despite its early mover's advantage, ChargePoint faces intense competition from Tesla's Superchargers and smaller challengers like EVgo. The company grew rapidly in 2022 and 2023 but slowed down in the past two years. ChargePoint expects its revenue to decline 17-19% in fiscal 2025, but analysts predict a narrowing of its GAAP net loss to $270 million.

Despite its early mover's advantage, the company faces intense competition from Tesla's Superchargers and smaller challengers like EVgo. ChargePoint's growth slowed to a crawl over the past two years, and it remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis. For fiscal 2025, the company expects its revenue to decline 17% to 19%, but analysts expect its adjusted EBITDA to improve to negative $127 million. ChargePoint is deploying fewer higher-margin AC chargers and more lower-margin DC chargers, which is expected to compress its near-term gross margin. However, analysts still expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 7% from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027. The company's partnership with General Motors and its higher-margin subscription services could generate tailwinds, and it still holds $220 million in cash and equivalents. With an enterprise value of $562 million, ChargePoint stock trades at just 1.4 times this year's sales, limiting its downside potential.

Thieves typically target the copper content of the cables, causing damage to the charging stations and exacerbating the unreliability of the US electric vehicle infrastructure. According to Steve Farrell, Vice President of Product Management at ChargePoint, the new cable uses a patented technology that adds steel to the cable to enhance its protective capabilities. Although this design may make the cable slightly thicker and less flexible, Farrell emphasizes that the user experience will not be affected, and most users 'will not notice these changes.' The new cable is also compatible with ChargePoint's existing commercial and fleet charging stations, including AC and DC charging pedestals. In addition to the new cable, ChargePoint has also authorized this design to be licensed to other 'select' electric vehicle charging device manufacturers to jointly address the theft issue. This technology is expected to be officially open-sourced by mid-2025. Furthermore, ChargePoint has launched a security software called 'ChargePoint Protect' that upgrades charging stations to a 'high-efficiency' alarm system. The software can detect in real-time whether the cable has been damaged and trigger an alarm to deter thieves, while sending SMS and email notifications to the charging station owner. Farrell notes that ChargePoint Protect is compatible with most of the company's existing commercial charging station models, but some older models may not be compatible. This software update will be pushed wirelessly for free to charging station owners and is expected to be officially launched later this month.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u5173\u6751\u5728\u7ebf](https://news.zol.com.cn/939/9399743.html)\n\n**ChargePoint Takes On Vandals With New Cut-Resistant EV Charging Cables**\nChargePoint, a charging network, has introduced a two-pronged plan to combat EV charger vandalism.

The new cables are expected to be available by mid-2025, and the cable technology will also be made available for licensing. ChargePoint Protect will be rolled out as an over-the-air update in January, and will use existing speakers, screens, and lighting to create an alarm.

Hits 52-Week Low Amid Market Challenges**\nChargePoint Holdings Inc. (CHPT) has hit a 52-week low of $1.04 due to market challenges. According to InvestingPro, the company appears to be undervalued based on its metrics. The current price reflects a significant setback for the company, which specializes in electric vehicle charging solutions. The stock has experienced a substantial decline over the past year, with a 20.7% drop in revenue over the past 12 months. InvestingPro's data reveals concerning trends, including the company rapidly burning through its cash reserves and analysts revising their profit forecasts downward. This decline reflects broader market trends and investor sentiment, as the industry faces headwinds such as supply chain disruptions and a shift in investor focus away from growth-oriented technology stocks. Despite recent developments, including a major partnership with General Motors to expand electric vehicle charging infrastructure across the US by the end of 2025, analysts have revised their profit forecasts downward. ChargePoint's current EBITDA of -$223 million highlights the importance of reducing operational expenses and increasing gross margins for future profitability. These recent developments highlight the ongoing efforts and challenges faced by ChargePoint in the electric vehicle charging network space. 'We need to see improvement in margins and revenue growth,' said analysts at Stifel and RBC Capital, who have maintained their respective 'Hold' and 'Sector Perform' ratings.

This would mean that charges related to actions taken before this date would be dropped. A court expert had previously concluded that German Pellets was in financial trouble much earlier than this date. The German Pellets GmbH filed for bankruptcy in February 2016. The details of the agreement are expected to be finalized by January 30, but a verdict is unlikely before the end of April, according to reports.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 03:23 PM\nSource:[stern.de](https://www.stern.de/gesellschaft/regional/mecklenburg-vorpommern/betrugsprozess--deal-im-betrugsprozess-um-german-pellets-insolvenz-geplant-35364324.html)\n\n**ChargePoint holdings CFO Mansi Khetani sells $25,226 in stock By Investing.com**\nMansi Khetani, Chief Financial Officer of ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., sold 22,038 shares of the company's common stock for $25,226.

Historically, the base rate for public companies in the technology sector filing for bankruptcy in a given year is approximately 1-2%, with those facing major disruptions or poor financial health seeing a rate closer to 10-20% depending on specific conditions like high debt load or reduced market demand. Given that ChargePoint operates in the electric vehicle charging sector, which is growing but also competitive and can be capital-intensive, an adjusted initial base rate of 5% for potential financial distress is reasonable, acknowledging the specific challenges and opportunities in this sector.",
