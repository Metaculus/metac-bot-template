However, the market experienced intramonth volatility, with the VIX rising over 20%, due to news of China's DeepSeek AI causing a sell-off in the Tech sector. Despite positive returns, clouds hang over both the market and the economy, with consumer sentiment falling by roughly 5% in February on rising inflation expectations driven by tariffs and supply shocks. Mortgage rates remain close to 7%, and prices remain elevated compared to pre-COVID levels. The probability of at least a minor correction in US large-caps has increased, and any negative surprises in terms of rising inflation or increased unemployment will not be easily shrugged off.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 04:46 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@benjaminpoor/january-2025-market-commentary-00e619cdf38a)\n\n**Three Key Factors to Watch in the US Stock Market Over the Next Week**\nFranklin Templeton has identified three key factors to watch in the US stock market over the next week. Firstly, US Federal Reserve officials' views on the economy, employment, inflation, and interest rates will be closely monitored. Secondly, economic data to be released in the coming week includes the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), retail sales, and industrial production. Thirdly, 77 S&P 500 companies will release their earnings reports, including Applied Materials, AMD, Palo Alto Networks, Equinix, Crown Castle, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, Airbnb, Expedia, CVS Health, GE Healthcare, Gilead Sciences, Moderna, Vertex, Biogen, and others. Franklin Templeton notes that the uncertainty of US inflation due to Trump's tariffs policy may lead the Fed to slow down interest rate cuts and maintain a 'wait and see' stance. However, the current US economy remains stable and continues to support corporate earnings. According to FactSet data as of February 7, 2025, S&P 500 index companies are expected to grow their earnings by 13% in 2025, with tech stocks expected to grow by 21.8%. Franklin Templeton points out that despite the recent disruption caused by DeepSeek's low-cost AI model, innovative AI development processes will benefit companies that actively invest in AI, particularly in the AI application field, and will accelerate the adoption of AI in the long run, in addition to the themes of relaxed regulation, mergers and acquisitions, and others, the tech sector still has a promising outlook.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 06:53 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/123398/8537018)\n\n**Three Key Variables to Watch in US Stock Market Next Week**\nFranklin Templeton pointed out that there are three key variables to watch in the US stock market over the next week. Firstly, US Federal Reserve officials' views on the economy, employment, inflation, and interest rates will be worth paying attention to. Secondly, economic data to be released over the next week includes the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), Producer Price Index (PPI), retail sales, and industrial production. Thirdly, 77 S&P 500 companies will release their earnings reports, including Applied Materials, AMD, Palo Alto Networks, Equinix, Crown Castle, McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, Airbnb, Expedia, CVS Health, GE Healthcare, Gilead Sciences, Moderna, Vertex, Biogen, etc. Franklin Templeton noted that the uncertainty of US inflation due to Trump's tariffs policy may lead the Fed to slow down the pace of rate cuts and maintain a 'wait and see' stance. However, the current US economy remains stable and still supports the profitability of US stock companies. According to FactSet data as of February 7, 2025, the S&P 500 index is expected to grow 13% in 2025, with the technology sector expected to grow 21.8%. Franklin Templeton pointed out that although the recent low-cost AI model from DeepSeek has had a significant impact on the technology sector, innovative AI development processes will benefit companies that actively layout AI, especially in the AI application field, and will also accelerate the popularization of AI in the long run, in addition to the relaxation of regulations, mergers and acquisitions, etc., the technology sector still has a bright future.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 06:33 AM\nSource:[UDN](https://udn.com/news/story/7251/8537018)\n\n**US Stock Market Outlook: Mixed predictions and warning signs in 2025**\nAnalysts and major financial firms have mixed opinions and predictions about the US stock market in 2025. Goldman Sachs expects the S&P 500 Index to continue rising, reaching 6,500 by the end of 2025, driven by strong economic growth and steady earnings. However, Nassim Taleb warned investors about the risk of concentrating capital in technology stocks, particularly Nvidia, and warned of a severe shock. Morgan Stanley advises investors to diversify their portfolios in 2025 due to changing market conditions. BlackRock feels the broad market may not deliver another year of outsized double-digit gains, and history suggests that returns may normalize towards the annual average. The impact of new policies, such as tariffs and immigration, is uncertain, and history augers well for positive returns in the first year of a Presidential term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 06:32 AM\nSource:[The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/investing-abroad-us-stock-markets-hot-streak-faces-uncertainty-in-2025-analysts-weigh-in-3743921/)\n\n**Wall Street Reacts to Mixed Employment Report**\nThe Wall Street trading session began with a stable trend, influenced by the recent report on US employment for 2025. In the previous month, the economy created 143,000 non-agricultural jobs, lower than the analysts' expectations of a 169,000 increase. The main stock indices showed small gains at the opening: the Dow Jones rose by 33.96 points, a 0.08% increase, the S&P 500 grew by 4.55 points (+0.07%), and the Nasdaq added 7.03 points (+0.04%). The oil market also showed a positive movement, with the Wti price at the Nymex increasing by 1.01%, reaching $71.32 per barrel.

The report showed employment increased by 143,000 jobs, less than expected, but the unemployment rate unexpectedly edged lower to 4.0%. The mixed data may lead to uncertainty about interest rates, keeping traders on the sidelines. The University of Michigan is due to release its preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in February, which could impact the outlook for interest rates. Stocks showed a lack of direction on Thursday, with the major averages swinging back and forth before closing mixed. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 reached new highs, but the Dow fell. The Labor Department also released a report showing initial jobless claims rose by more than expected, and labor productivity and unit labor costs increased by less than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. Banking stocks moved higher, while steel stocks turned in a strong performance, and energy stocks were under pressure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 09:05 AM\nSource:[advfn.com](https://ih.advfn.com/market-news/article/9775/mixed-jobs-data-may-lead-to-choppy-trading-on-wall-street-2)\n\n**S&P 500 Snapshot: Another Red Week Despite Midweek Gains**\nThe S&P 500 finished the week in the red, posting a 0.2% loss from last Friday. The index is now 1.52% below its record close on January 23, 2025, but is up 2.68% year to date. The U.S. Treasury reported a closing yield of 4.49% on the 10-year note and 4.29% on the 2-year note. The S&P 500 has experienced significant drawdowns in the past, including a 57% drop during the Global Financial Crisis. However, if we exclude this period, the index has shown resilience, with recent selloffs in 2022 being notable exceptions. The index has experienced 1% or greater changes in either direction for 34 days in the past year, with corrections of 10% or more from the record high occurring 5 times.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[advisorperspectives.com](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/02/07/s-p-500-snapshot-another-red-week-despite-midweek-gains)\n\n**S&P 500 Rises for Third Straight Day**\nThe S&P 500 index rose for the third consecutive day on Thursday, as investors watched the latest batch of corporate earnings reports, with concerns over the impact of Trump's tariffs decreasing.

According to historical trends, positive January performance often sets the tone for above-average annual returns, with an average return of 16% in years with positive January performance. If this trend holds, the S&P 500 could end the year at around 6,823, a 13% increase from its current value. However, caution is warranted due to the index's elevated valuation, which is 2.2 times higher than its five-year average. The Fed forecasts a slowdown in growth to 2.1% by Q4 2025, with a few upticks in inflation, and consensus estimates predict faster earnings growth in 2025 than in 2024. Any major divergence from these projections could lead to market corrections, providing entry points for investors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The markets may benefit from recent upward momentum, but trading activity may be subdued ahead of the Labor Department's jobs report on Friday. The report is expected to show employment climbed by 170,000 jobs in January. However, initial jobless claims rose by 11,000 to 219,000 in the week ended February 1st, exceeding expectations. Labor productivity and unit labor costs also increased by less than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved mostly higher, with Japan's Nikkei 225 Index climbing by 0.6 percent and China's Shanghai Composite Index jumping by 1.3 percent.

However, only 28% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024, the second-lowest reading since 1980. This growing market concentration could signal a big move in the stock market in 2025. Historically, when a small minority of stocks outperform the S&P 500, the market tends to broaden out, with more stocks performing well. This trend reversed in 2000, with over 60% of S&P 500 constituents outperforming the index. The trend could reverse again in 2025, driven by growing U.S. money supply and easier access to cash for smaller companies. To hedge against market concentration and potential trend reversal, investors can consider an equal-weight S&P 500 index fund like the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, which has historically outperformed the capitalization-weighted index in the long run.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/06/the-sp-500-just-did-something-it-hasnt-done-in-ove/)\n\n**The S&P 500 Soared in January. History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next. | The Motley Fool**\nThe S&P 500 index advanced 2.7% in January, despite rising bond yields and a decline in the technology sector. Historically, January gains have led to above-average returns for the full year. In the past three decades, the S&P 500 has moved higher in January 17 times, and the index has returned an average of 16% during years in which it increased in January. The Federal Reserve estimates economic growth will decelerate to 2.1% by the fourth quarter of 2025, and policymakers anticipate inflation will increase to 2.4%. However, the Federal Open Market Committee expects two quarter-point rate cuts this year, which could be a headwind for the stock market. Consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts call for S&P 500 companies to report faster earnings growth in 2025. The median year-end target for the S&P 500 is about 6,600 in 2025, but if earnings increase more slowly than anticipated, the index could finish the year much lower. The S&P 500 currently trades at 22 times forward earnings, a premium to the five-year average. According to FactSet Research, the index's forward PE multiple has only hit 22 during two periods in the last four decades: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and the Covid-19 pandemic in the early 2020s. 'The S&P 500 has typically followed January gains with above-average returns for the full year. That pattern may repeat itself in 2025. But investors should be cautious in the current environment. Valuations are elevated, so any bad news could derail the stock market,' said the article. 'Fortunately, if the S&P 500 does suffer a correction or bear market this year, the drawdown would undoubtedly be a buying opportunity. Every pullback in history has been temporary, and the S&P 500 has always recouped its losses. There is no reason to expect a different outcome the next time the stock market declines.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 09:20 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/06/the-sp-500-soared-in-january-history-says-the-stoc/)\n\n**The S&P 500 Soared in January.

Stephen Suttmeier, chief technical strategist at Bank of America Securities, stated that if the S&P 500 closes above 5,882 points on Friday, 'the January Barometer will generate a bullish signal for the returns of the entire year 2025 and from February to December.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 04:35 PM\nSource:[bolsamania.com](https://www.bolsamania.com/capitalbolsa/noticias/bolsa/el-barometro-de-enero-apunta-a-ganancias-de-las-bolsas-en-2025--18722848.html)\n\n**January Barometer Predicts Gains for 2025**\nThe January Barometer suggests gains for 2025 after a 3.2% increase in the S&P 500 in January.

Hirsch said, 'I feel encouraged by the market gains so far in January, with one day to go.' He also noted, 'It's bullish. But the gains in 2025 will be more difficult and less pronounced than in the last two years.' Hirsch is cautious about the first quarter, especially in February and March, as this period is 'a weak point in the 4-year presidential cycle.' Despite the recent cooling of the 'AI fever,' the broad participation and sector rotation are welcome. Stephen Suttmeier, a technical analyst at Bank of America Securities, said that if the S&P 500 closes above 5,882 on Friday, 'the January Barometer will generate a bullish signal for 2025 and the February-December period.'
