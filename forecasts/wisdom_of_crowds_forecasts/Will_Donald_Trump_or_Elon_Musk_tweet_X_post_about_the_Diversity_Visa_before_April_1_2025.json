Trump stated that DOGE is 'headed by Elon Musk', who is a 'Special Government Employee' serving on a temporary basis. However, White House lawyers have described Musk's role as different from an executive, and plaintiffs have challenged firings of federal workers and members of independent agencies. Trump also read through a series of programs he ripped as wasteful, including '$45 million for Diversity Equity and Inclusion scholarships in Burma' and '$32 million for a left wing propaganda operation in Moldova'. Musk even looked like a boss for the occasion, donning a dark suit instead of his usual 'tech support' t-shirt and MAGA cap. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) stressed bipartisan and kitchen table issues in the Democratic response, while hammering Trump for his Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian president and for Elon Musk's exploits.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 05:29 AM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14462857/Elon-musk-trump-doge-admission.html)\n\n**Trump vows to end 'woke' culture in US, promises radical reforms**\nUS President Donald Trump stated in a speech to the US Congress that he has ended the 'tyranny' of diversity and inclusion programs across the federal government. Trump said, 'Our country will not be more woke.' He emphasized that the 'American dream is unstoppable,' after six weeks of tension with neighboring countries, Canada and Mexico. Trump's close advisor, Elon Musk, was present at the speech, which was delivered during peak viewing hours. Trump praised his administration's accomplishments in the past six weeks and promised to continue his efforts to radically reform the US government and end the war in Ukraine, no matter the cost. He said, 'We have achieved more in 43 days than most administrations achieve in four or eight years, and we are just getting started.' Trump also announced plans to request funds to implement his policy of deporting irregular migrants. The White House considers these migrants to be criminals for entering the country without a visa, and Trump has ordered raids and deportations, including at the US military base in Guantanamo, Cuba.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 04:48 AM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/mundo/estados-unidos/trump-lanza-advertencia-congreso-ee-uu-nuestro-pais-no-sera-woke-PP4356746)\n\n**Trump's Address to Congress: 'We've Accomplished More in 43 Days Than Most Administrations in 4 or 8 Years'**\nUS President Donald Trump addressed Congress on March 4, highlighting his administration's 'achievements' and announcing upcoming decrees. Trump stated, 'We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations have in 4 or 8 years, and we're just getting started.' He emphasized that his government has restored 'pride' and 'confidence' in the country, asserting that 'The American Dream is unstoppable.' Key points from Trump's speech include: 1. Criticizing Joe Biden's presidency, Trump called him the 'worst president' for allowing migrants to enter the country and for the high price of eggs. 2. Defending the imposition of tariffs, Trump said, 'What they charge us, we will charge them.' 3. Vowing to reject 'woke' policies, Trump referred to the abandonment of inclusion and diversity policies: 'We put an end to the tyranny of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the federal government, the private sector, and our armed forces.' 4. Announcing reciprocal tariffs, which will be applied on April 2. 5. Praising Elon Musk, Trump recognized his efforts to combat inflation and reduce government waste. 6. Criticizing Mexico and Canada for failing to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US, Trump said, 'We need Mexico and Canada to do more to stop fentanyl.' 7. Signing a decree imposing the death penalty on those who assassinate police officers: 'We will make it quick to get these cold-blooded and repeat offenders off our streets.' 8. Proposing tax cuts: 'The next phase of our plan to achieve the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to approve tax cuts for all.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 04:11 AM\nSource:[Vanguardia](https://vanguardia.com.mx/noticias/internacional/hemos-logrado-mas-en-43-dias-que-otros-presidentes-en-ocho-anos-donald-trump-frente-al-congreso-EC15172503)\n\n**Trump: Tariffs are key to making US 'rich again'**\nIn his first address to the US Congress, President Trump stated that tariffs imposed on trade partners are aimed at protecting American jobs and making the country 'rich again'. Trump also claimed that February saw the lowest number of illegal border crossings due to his administration's actions. He emphasized that in 43 days, his government has achieved more than other administrations have in 4 years. Trump highlighted his priorities, including rescuing the economy and providing relief to working-class families. He criticized the previous administration's policies, saying they led to a 'catastrophic' economy and 'nightmare' inflation. Trump also mentioned the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, and his 'golden visa' program that grants citizenship to investors. He joked that he initially wanted to implement reciprocal tariffs on April 1, but chose not to on April Fool's Day.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 03:46 AM\nSource:[El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez](https://diario.mx/estados-unidos/2025/mar/04/aranceles-son-para-hacer-a-eu-rico-otra-vez-trump-1056313.html)\n\n**Trump reiterates plans for tariffs, touts tax cuts in Congress address By Investing.com**\nU.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his plans for tariffs against major trading partners during an address to Congress, calling for an end to unfair trading practices. He announced reciprocal tariffs against countries that impose tariffs on U.S. exports, which will take effect from April 2. Trump also proposed tax cuts, including making interest payments on American-made automobiles tax deductible, and claimed that his policies will benefit American farmers. However, he warned of an 'adjustment period' after announcing tariffs on agricultural imports. Trump also criticized the Biden administration and Democrats, claiming they are responsible for recent increases in inflation and criticized policies of 'Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.' He also listed alleged fraud and wasteful spending identified by his Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, and announced plans to maintain a hardline on securing America's borders. 'We've been ripped off for decades, and we will not let that happen any longer,' Trump said. 'Tariffs are about making America rich again, making America great again.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 03:35 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy/trump-reiterates-plans-for-tariffs-touts-tax-cuts-in-congress-address-3907839)\n\n**Trump Praises Musk, Announces Plan to Balance Federal Budget and Introduce 'Golden Card' Visa**\nUS President Trump praised Elon Musk in a congressional speech, thanking him for helping to discover thousands of billions of dollars in fraudulent activities. Trump claimed that there are 3.5 million people in the US who are between 140 and 149 years old and receiving social security benefits. Trump stated that Musk's 'Government Efficiency Department' (DOGE) is reducing federal government projects and that Musk's allies are also participating in Trump's administration's policy of firing federal employees. Trump also mentioned that the Education Department's diversity, equity, and inclusion contracts received $101 million in funding, the highest amount ever paid. Trump claimed that all of these are scams and that they have discovered thousands of billions of dollars in fraudulent activities. Trump said, 'We have recovered the funds and reduced the debt to address inflation and other issues. We have done it on time. Our database lists 4.7 million members aged 100-109 who are participating in social security, 3.6 million members aged 110 and above, 34.7 million members aged 120-129, 39 million members aged 130-139, and 3.5 million members aged 140-149. By cutting down on all the waste and theft we can find, we will defeat inflation, lower mortgage rates, reduce car payments and food prices, protect our seniors, and put more money in American households.' Trump also announced that he plans to balance the federal budget in the near future, a goal that has not been achieved in 24 years. To achieve this goal, Trump detailed a plan called the 'Golden Card' visa, which will be launched soon at a price of $500 million. The plan will allow the world's most successful job creators to buy a pathway to US citizenship. These individuals must pay taxes in the US and cannot be taxed on income from their home country. They will also be able to recruit talent from universities and pay for their education so that they can stay in the US instead of being forced to leave. Trump said, 'We will now bring in smart, hardworking, and job-creating people. We have thousands of federal employees who are not showing up on time. Any official who resists our reforms will be fired.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 03:26 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u7f51](http://tech.hexun.com/2025-03-05/217699723.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Makes Harsh Comment on Zelenskyy Following His Controversial Statement on War With Russia**\nElon Musk and Donald Trump have criticized Volodymyr Zelenskyy's statement that the end of the war with Russia is 'still very, very far away.' Trump said, 'This is the worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky, and America will not put up with it for much longer.' Musk tweeted, 'Zelensky wants a forever war, a never-ending graft meat grinder. This is evil.' Trump has also threatened to stop sending military aid to Ukraine if Zelenskyy does not comply with his demands for a peaceful end to the war. Zelenskyy has remained firm and has not appeared to be threatened by Trump's words or Musk's tweets. 'It should not be that hard a deal to make,' Trump said. 'If somebody doesn't want to make a deal, I think that person won't be around very long.' Musk echoed Trump's voice, saying that Zelenskyy wants a 'forever war' because he does not want to 'lose his spotlight on the international stage.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 02:27 PM\nSource:[The Inquisitr](https://www.inquisitr.com/elon-musk-makes-harsh-comment-on-zelenskyy-following-his-controversial-statement-on-war-with-russia)\n\n**Musk Backs Trump's Criticism of Zelenskiy's War Statement**\nElon Musk supported Donald Trump's response to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's statement that 'the end of the war is not near.'

Thousands of public employees have been fired or will soon lose their contracts, and international workers and students with visas are facing uncertain futures. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, over 1,000 employees were fired, mostly with less than two years of experience. The Department of Energy and the Forest Service also terminated contracts of over 5,000 employees. Trump has appointed Elon Musk to restructure government agencies and departments, and it is unclear how many more employees will be fired. 'There is a sense of uncertainty among professionals with experience. Nobody knows what will happen and they are already looking for alternatives,' said a professor of Public Affairs. The job market is not looking promising, with many students and graduates facing a tough time finding employment. 'Unfortunately, this year's graduates will have a harder time finding their first job opportunity,' said a career advisor. Even those with an MBA from top universities are struggling to find employment. The Economist reported that in the last decade, 82% of students from elite universities had accepted a job offer before graduation, but in 2024, that number dropped to 62%. It is expected to decrease even further in 2025. 'I invested in my education and have good credentials, but I am aware that I will have to compete with hundreds of people with years of experience who are looking to change sectors or fields,' said Sarah, an MBA student in New York. 'I have stopped applying to public sector or consulting jobs, I think finance is the only stable field for us now,' added Arnold, who will graduate in May and applies to 'a dozen jobs' every week, but sees no progress. International students who come to the US to study and have the right to a one-year work permit in the case of social sciences or three years in STEM fields are also feeling the uncertainty. The elimination of diversity plans in the public sector and private companies like Meta has cancelled the competitive advantage that some of these students had to enter the US job market, which is already difficult due to the limited possibilities of maintaining a job once the student visa expires. The most direct way is to obtain a H-1B work visa, which requires the employer to justify the hiring of a non-citizen based on their skills or talents. However, this also has limitations, as the candidate supported by the company must participate in a lottery where the cap is 85,000 permits per year. 'For now, this practice is maintained, but it is true that there is some noise about it and many recruitment departments are being cautious when considering international candidates,' admitted a recruiter from a consulting firm. Trump has said in previous occasions that he is 'a believer in the H-1B visa' and that he 'has many foreign workers with H-1B visas in my properties.' Other voices from the Republican Party criticize the program, arguing that it takes jobs away from US citizens. Trump's actions on immigration have focused on deporting undocumented immigrants and have not touched the visa system, which is also defended by Elon Musk and other tech moguls in Silicon Valley, who argue that the US should be a magnet for talent -Musk himself arrived with a student visa to attend Stanford-. It was expected that something would be said about this issue after Trump's meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as India is the country with the most recipients of work visas, but there was no mention of it, leaving international students and employees with the same uncertainties as public employees.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 03:23 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/mundo/america/20250217/trump-pone-mercado-laboral-patas-arriba-universitarios-inmigrantes-empleados-publicos-futuro-incierto/924657653_0.html)\n\n**Trump Administration Opens Registration Period for H-1B Visas**\nThe Trump administration has opened up the registration period for a type of visa that is supported by Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, which would allow foreign workers to legally work in the United States while potentially paving the way for a change in their immigration status.

The tweets, which included messages such as 'I was a racist before it was cool' and 'I wouldn't mind if Gaza and Israel were erased from the face of the earth', were discovered by The Wall Street Journal. Elez, who worked on intelligence AI and was a SpaceX and Starlink employee, had been monitoring Treasury Department expenditures, one of only two DOGE members authorized to do so. The tweets were posted on an account that was later deleted, but The Wall Street Journal was able to connect it to Elez. 'I wouldn't marry someone from a different ethnicity even for all the gold in the world', he tweeted in September. 'Normalizing hate towards Indians', he wrote the same month, referencing a post about the prevalence of people of Indian descent in Silicon Valley. He appeared to have a particular disdain for Indian software engineers. In one message, he celebrated the idea that 99% of Indian programmers with specialized work visas would be replaced by AI language models, forcing them to return to their country. The tweet 'I was a racist before it was cool' was posted in July. 'I wouldn't mind at all if Gaza and Israel were erased from the face of the earth', he wrote in June. The resignation comes after the DOGE was tasked with reforming the US administration by President Donald Trump. 'This is methodical and will generate great savings', said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who defended the training of the two DOGE employees, including Elez, in a Bloomberg interview. 'They are highly trained professionals, not a traveling band doing things', he said.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 11:04 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/internacional/2025-02-06/un-hombre-clave-de-elon-musk-en-el-doge-dimite-al-aflorar-sus-tuits-racistas.html)\n\n**Fact Check: Elon Musk Did NOT Tweet 'Anyone Protesting The Trump Administration Will Be Suspended From X'**\nA claim that Elon Musk tweeted 'Anyone protesting the Trump Administration will be suspended from X' is false.

According to NBC News, Musk indeed posted the message on Jan. 9, 2024, in response to a user who speculated that United Airlines pilots from historically Black colleges and universities would score lower than the average IQ of Air Force pilots. Musk's post read, 'It will take an airplane crashing and killing hundreds of people for them to change this crazy policy of DIE.' The post resurfaced following a deadly midair collision between an American Airlines plane and an Army helicopter in Washington on Jan. 29, 2025, which claimed the lives of all 67 people aboard both aircraft. President Donald Trump and other members of his administration baselessly blamed diversity hiring and DEI as a potential factor leading to the collision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 10:37 AM\nSource:[knowledia.com](https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/yes-musk-once-posted-it-would-take-airplane-crash-to-end-crazy-dei-652f7a929f130e527a2a63d753080204eca02274)\n\n**Elon Musk's Confusing Tweet: Astronauts Not 'Stuck' in ISS, NASA Mission Delayed**\nElon Musk has claimed that Donald Trump asked him to rescue two astronauts, Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who are 'stuck' in the International Space Station (ISS). However, the situation is more complex than Musk's tweet suggests. The NASA mission to bring the astronauts back to Earth was planned in August, before Trump's re-election, and was delayed due to issues with the SpaceX capsule. The astronauts are not 'trapped' in the ISS, as Musk claimed, and can use the Crew-9 spacecraft in case of an emergency. The delay is due to the fact that the Crew-10 mission, which is supposed to relieve them, has been postponed until March because the new SpaceX spacecraft is not ready. Musk's tweet has caused confusion, and NASA, SpaceX, and the White House have not responded to requests for clarification. It is unlikely that the astronauts will return to Earth before April.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 05:35 PM\nSource:[Le Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/international/video/elon-musk-veut-secourir-ces-astronautes-bloques-dans-l-espace-mais-personne-ne-sait-comment_245621.html)\n\n**Under Donald Trump, Elon Musk-led DOGE begins cuts on Biden's DEI initiatives**\nHours after Donald Trump's inauguration, Elon Musk tweeted 'It begins', referring to a Trump executive order that ended federal diversity, equity and inclusion mandates (DEI).

Trump said Musk's group will have an office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, with about 20 people hired to implement the programme.

The lawsuit cites the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which requires transparency and checks for potential conflicts of interest for groups with direct connections to the White House. Another lawsuit was filed by the National Security Advisor, which also claims that DOGE violated the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The lawsuit argues that DOGE should follow the relevant regulations, including keeping meeting records, submitting a charter to Congress, and allowing public participation. However, Musk and Ramaswamy have never publicly disclosed meeting records, and team members often use encrypted communication tools. Ramaswamy announced his departure from DOGE just hours after Trump's inauguration, citing his intention to run for governor of Ohio. Ramaswamy himself stated on social media that he believes Musk and his team can streamline the government, and 'I will soon reveal my plans for the Ohio governor election.' However, sources close to Musk reveal that he has been 'displeased' with Ramaswamy, who has also made several Republicans in Trump's circle unhappy. Ramaswamy's previous comments on H-1B visas have accelerated his departure. According to sources, the main reason for Ramaswamy's departure is that he has been 'kicked out' by the Republicans, who are unhappy with his previous tweet criticizing American culture and stating that top tech companies prefer to hire foreign workers because of a 'preference for mediocrity over excellence' in the US. Musk, on the other hand, has expressed support for H-1B visas and has employees who hold such visas. Trump has also publicly stated his support for the visa program. A Republican strategist close to Trump's advisors said that 'almost everyone' in Trump's circle wants Ramaswamy to leave the White House. 'He was kicked out before he even had a chance to leave,' a source said. 'The Republicans were already looking for a way to get rid of him before he published that tweet. After the tweet, they just kicked him out.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 12:12 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8gKUFV7lW8O)\n\n**Watch:  Why is there so much noise about H-1B visas?**\nUS President-Elect Trump has defended the H-1B visa programme after his supporters turned on his Indian appointees, suggesting that their support for the programme was not truly 'America first'.

The H-1B visa programme allows non-immigrants from countries like India to legally reside and work in the US.

The article, written by Stephen Moore, argues that H-1B white-collar migration is good for America's investors, businesses, and big government. However, many critics argue that the program damages innovation, pushes American graduates out of jobs, and allows Indian and Chinese migrants to take over American businesses. A recent poll showed that 27% of Americans want the H-1B program to be reduced or eliminated, while only 17% want it increased. Trump's likely voters are also pushing back against him, threatening his chance of winning the 2026 mid-term races. Moore, a long-standing advocate for more H-1B visas, has also been criticized for his support of corporate migration and opposition to tariffs. 'I'm a free-trade guy,' he said in a December 2025 interview. Moore's article has been touted by Trump, who has also been criticized for his support of the H-1B program. 'I've always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That's why we have them,' Trump told the New York Post. However, many experts agree that the H-1B program needs reform, including Elon Musk, who tweeted that 'I am referring to bringing in via legal immigration the top ~0.1 percent of engineering talent as being essential for America to keep winning.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 03:48 AM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/01/09/trump-touts-pro-migration-article-amid-voter-blowback-on-white-collar-migrants/)\n\n**Bannon Calls Musk 'Evil' and Launches Strong Attack**\nSteve Bannon, a former close advisor to Donald Trump, has launched a strong attack against Elon Musk, calling him 'a really evil person'.

The two Trump supporters had a conflict in late 2024 over the H1B visa issue for specialized and talented immigrants, with Musk supporting the visa and Bannon opposing it. Bannon said, 'The problem is that the tech-feudals use them to their advantage and people are furious... The 76% of engineers in Silicon Valley are not Americans. Recovering our economy passes through this issue. They are the best jobs, and African Americans and Hispanics do not have access to them.' Bannon also stated that Musk's agenda is to become the first billionaire, and that he is not prioritizing the interests of American citizens. Musk had previously tweeted about the H1B visa issue, saying 'I will go to war on this issue in a way that you cannot even imagine.' Bannon had previously praised Musk for his support of Trump, but now seems to be opposed to him. Bannon stated that Musk has lost credibility in the US and that people close to Trump are tired of him. He also said that Musk has the maturity of a child and that he has been intrusive and lacking in understanding of real problems.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 02:25 PM\nSource:[LA GRAN \u00c9POCA](https://es.theepochtimes.com/news/bannon-llama-musk-persona-malvada-adivierte-hara-todo-detenerlo-1327799.html)\n\n**Indian tech companies secured one fifth of H-1B visas in 2024**\nAccording to USCIS data, Indian tech companies secured nearly one fifth of H-1B visas between April and September 2024, with Infosys leading the pack with 8,140 visas.

The initial probabilities varied, with most experts estimating a low likelihood due to the specificity and relative obscurity of the topic. Initial probabilities were generally low, ranging from 0% to 25%, influenced by historical tweet patterns and the current political climate. \n\nUpon reviewing recent news articles, experts adjusted their predictions slightly, with some increasing the probability due to Trump's focus on immigration and diversity-related criticisms, while others maintained their lower estimates due to the lack of direct mention of the 'Diversity Visa' in current discussions by Trump or Musk. Revised probabilities ranged from 0% to 30%, indicating a generally low but slightly increased likelihood of a tweet about the 'Diversity Visa' specifically occurring. Overall, the consensus suggests a low probability, with some experts factoring in potential but unspecified external triggers that could prompt such a tweet.",
