    "fine_print": "If this does not happen for any reason, whether because Trump does not say the required terms or because there is not a Donald Trump speech to a joint session of Congress on that date, this question resolves as **No**. Must happen during the speech, not before or after it; for example him saying one of the terms while walking into the Capitol would not count. Discussion of the subject matter, without actually using either term, will not count.",

If confirmed, Meador will be the third Republican Commissioner, ending the current deadlock and beginning a Republican majority era at the FTC. This is expected to lead to a slowdown in rulemaking, increased scrutiny of Big Tech, and reduced regulation of Artificial Intelligence technologies. Chairman Andrew Ferguson has already been given authority to comply with President Trump's executive orders ending Diversity Equity and Inclusion initiatives.

A possible reduction in staff, requested by President Donald Trump and carried out by the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk, threatens to compromise initiatives such as the US Artificial Intelligence Security Institute, founded by Joe Biden, and the Chips for America program. According to Axios, this would be a 'demolition' of key divisions, with cuts affecting both probationary employees and those in their first year of contract. Bloomberg reports that some employees have already received verbal communications about the impending layoffs. Wired reports on the visit of some DOGE employees to the NIST Technology Laboratory offices on the agency's campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The US Artificial Intelligence Security Institute (AISI), created last year as part of President Biden's executive order on AI security, would be in a vulnerable position. The institute was responsible for studying AI risks and developing shared standards to balance innovation and security. Upon returning to office, President Trump revoked his predecessor's executive order, which also led to the resignation of the then-director, Elizabeth Kelly. The scientific community and organizations concerned with AI security have reacted with concern. Jason Green-Lowe, executive director of the AI Policy Center, expressed his concern in the organization's blog, saying that 'the cuts, if confirmed, would severely affect the government's ability to investigate and address AI security issues at a time when that expertise is more vital than ever.' According to Bloomberg, the affected staff could constitute a significant portion of the offices overseeing Biden-era semiconductor investments, including nearly three-quarters of the office executing $39 billion manufacturing incentive projects, as well as two-thirds of the staff responsible for $11 billion research and development programs.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 02:50 PM\nSource:[ansa.it](https://www.ansalatina.com/americalatina/noticia/ciencia_y_tecnologia/2025/02/24/el-recorte-trump-musk-tambien-impacta-en-la-ia_4d2d2c4d-8074-441f-9deb-07fd54661e0a.html)\n\n**National Bank of Fujairah Organizes Session on Leveraging Artificial Intelligence in Business**\nThe National Bank of Fujairah organized a session on leveraging artificial intelligence in business as part of its knowledge-sharing series. The session, which was attended by over 200 participants from the bank and other financial institutions, focused on strategies and tools for integrating AI technology into commercial operations. The event, titled 'Leveraging Artificial Intelligence: Strategies for Achieving Success in the Evolving Business Landscape,' explored the vast potential of AI and digitalization to bring about a qualitative leap in the rapidly changing business environment. The session featured a panel of expert speakers, including Robert Willoughby, Global Editor-in-Chief of Economist Intelligence Unit, who presented comprehensive economic forecasts for the region and globally, predicting that the UAE's real GDP growth will exceed 4% in 2025. The discussion touched on geopolitical shifts, including the expansion of the BRICS group, and the assessment that the Middle East will remain relatively distant from the risks associated with US trade and security policies after President Donald Trump's return to the White House. Willoughby also noted that Saudi Arabia has achieved higher levels of business confidence in the region compared to the UAE, citing the stability of the political environment, solid economic fundamentals, and increasing attractiveness of the business environment. Arnold Gottfurcht, Executive Partner at Gartner Gulf, highlighted the emergence of AI as a facilitator, a new development of AI that works independently to bring about impact in the real world. He emphasized that the future of AI lies in the hands of companies and urged institutions to move beyond adopting basic automation solutions and focus on AI's ability to generate revenue, drive innovation, and enhance strategic decision-making. Gottfurcht also stressed the importance of creating dedicated AI teams to ensure the successful integration of AI into business operations, saying, 'AI should be a colleague, not just a tool.' He concluded the session with an in-depth discussion on crafting a successful AI implementation strategy, emphasizing the role of AI as a key driver of business success, not just a technological tool. The session also highlighted the emergence of 'business technologists,' specialists in various departments who integrate AI into their workflows, with a focus on the need for a structured and flexible governance approach. The participants were encouraged to integrate buyer-centric AI, data ownership, and commercial AI models to enhance efficiency, decision-making, and risk management. The session is part of the National Bank of Fujairah's ongoing knowledge-sharing series, which has previously covered topics such as environmental and social standards, corporate governance, and investment management. The series will continue in 2025 to provide valuable insights to the bank's clients to help them navigate the evolving business landscape.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 10:37 AM\nSource:[Zawya.com](https://www.zawya.com/ar/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A8%D9%86%D9%83-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%AC%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%85-%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%AD%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-e4pp4d9l)\n\n**Javier Milei Prepares for Opening Speech of Congress Sessions**\nPresident Javier Milei is preparing to deliver his opening speech for the ordinary sessions of Congress on March 1st. He will maintain his regular meetings with his Cabinet on Tuesdays and Thursdays and focus on the speech, which will be delivered in the evening, around 21:00, as it was last year. The speech will be broadcast in the 'prime time' slot, as it was last year, to maximize its impact. The government will debate key projects, such as the Reform of the Penal Code and the 'discriminaci\u00f3n positiva' law, which aims to eliminate quotas for trans people and modify the Identity Law. Milei recently returned from a trip to the US, where he attended the CPAC conference and met with Donald Trump, Kristalina Georgieva, and Elon Musk. Trump praised Milei's work on reducing inflation, saying 'I'm proud of you.' Georgieva met with Milei to discuss a new agreement between Argentina and the IMF, aiming to secure an additional $11,000 million to strengthen the Central Bank's reserves and lift the financial restrictions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 04:25 AM\nSource:[rionegro.com.ar](https://www.rionegro.com.ar/politica/apertura-de-sesiones-de-javier-milei-que-se-sabe-del-horario-y-los-temas-que-abordara-4020503/)\n\n**Erotica, gore and racism: how America's war on 'ideological bias' is letting AI off the leash**\nThe US Federal Trade Commission has launched an inquiry into technology platforms that limit users' ability to share their ideas or affiliations freely and openly, which may lead to a relaxation of regulations on artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This comes after US President Donald Trump's executive orders to deregulate AI systems and remove 'ideological bias' from AI. As a result, some generative AI companies may be pressured to eliminate measures to make AI systems safe, potentially leading to the return of rogue behavior in AI. AI developers' interpretation of the executive orders could result in AI safety teams being reduced in size or scope, or replaced by teams whose social agenda better aligns with Trump's. This could have significant implications for the safety and regulation of AI products, particularly those with global user bases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 04:18 AM\nSource:[The Conversation](http://theconversation.com/erotica-gore-and-racism-how-americas-war-on-ideological-bias-is-letting-ai-off-the-leash-250060)\n\n**Trump Announces Joint Session of Congress Address on March 4, 2025**\nUS President Trump has announced that he will address a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025.

Amen\u00e1bar believes that humans will have to adapt to AI, which will transform the economy and society. However, he noted that it is still unclear whether AI will be a 'qualitative leap' and a 'change of species' or just a matter of coexistence. Javier Bonett, an actor and director, joked that the 'irresponsibility' with which the US is allowing AI to develop, led by Elon Musk, might be the solution to save the Earth from the asteroid, 'although it might kill us later.' Desir\u00e9e de Fez argued that horror movies are a 'catharsis' and a form of entertainment that allows viewers to experience situations on screen that they would not dare to face in real life.

President Trump's signing of Executive Order 14179, which focuses on AI and seeks an AI Action Plan, indicates strong executive interest in the topic. The involvement of high-level scientific and technological advisors in shaping this plan further elevates the likelihood that AI will be mentioned in the address. Additionally, the deregulation efforts and focus on removing 'ideological bias' from AI systems highlight an ongoing governmental focus on AI-related issues. Furthermore, Trump's administration's evident interest in showcasing these initiatives during a significant speech strengthens the possibility of AI being discussed.",
