To maintain this status, applicants must submit their application by March 31, 2026. According to the Government of Canada, 'These temporary measures will allow Ukrainians and their family members to continue working and studying in Canada during this difficult time, and ultimately return home when it is safe. Access to free settlement services for all Ukrainian temporary residents and their family members in Canada is available until March 31, 2025. We continue to assess how our immigration programs can best support people affected by the war in Ukraine,' - reads the government's website. Canadian Immigration Minister Mark Miller announced on February 27, 2025, that Ukrainians and their family members who entered Canada through the CUAET program by March 31, 2024, will have the right to submit an application to extend their status by March 31, 2026. 'Canada remains committed to supporting the people of Ukraine and their families as the war continues, ensuring their safety. That's why, through this expansion, we aim to offer protection, recognizing the long-term goal for many to return home safely and properly. We continue to support Ukraine and its people,' - quotes the department Mark Miller's words. 'Canada remains committed to supporting the people of Ukraine and their families as the war continues,' said Mark Miller. The Canada-Ukraine authorization for emergency travel (CUAET) is one of the special measures taken by the Canadian government to support the people of Ukraine. The program provides Ukrainians and their family members with extended temporary resident status, allowing them to work, study, and stay in Canada until they can safely return home. To date, nearly 300,000 people have used this initiative to move to Canada. Participants in the program receive temporary financial assistance and housing support. It is very important that all CUAET participants submit their applications for status extension before the expiration of their work or study permits. All CUAET visa applicants must meet visa and tourist requirements; undergo a standard biographical data check (including biometric data) and a control check. Individuals who submit their applications within the established timeframe will be allowed to maintain their current work or study status pending a decision on their application. Each case will be evaluated on an individual basis.'\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 09:29 PM\nSource:[newsyou.info](https://newsyou.info/2025/03/novij-status-dlya-ukra%D1%97nskix-bizhenciv-u-kanadi-yaki-umovi-slid-vikonati)\n\n**UK Opens Online Registration for Electronic Travel Authorization**\nThe United Kingdom will open the online registration for the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) on Wednesday, March 5. The ETA will be mandatory for travelers to the UK starting April 2, 2025. According to the UK Embassy in Spain, the ETA is a similar system to those used by other countries, such as the US and Australia, to improve border security. UK Ambassador to Spain, Alex Ellis, stated, 'It's a simple process that aims to improve security management.' Ellis also emphasized that the UK 'is delighted to continue receiving travelers from Spain,' who 'make a significant contribution to the country.' The registration process will cost 10 pounds (approximately 12 euros) and will be valid for two years.

According to the document, the project aims to provide an alternative to the current process. The project will allow citizens to exchange their expired passports and identity documents through the electronic government portal and mobile apps. The developers have proposed an algorithm for the pilot project, which includes documentation through the portal and mobile apps for citizens who need to exchange or replace their documents without a decision or administrative protocol. If the service is not available through the portal and mobile apps, the user will be notified to visit a CTO. The applicant must fill out the application themselves based on the documents specified in the Rules of Providing State Services. After forming the registration ticket, the application will be sent to the UMS DP of the corresponding region for verification. The employee of the UMS DP will check the application for correctness and accuracy, as well as the photo and signature, and, having certified it with an electronic digital signature, will send the application to the central node of the RPD DRN for document production. If the application is canceled due to a poor-quality photo or signature, the user can submit a new application, re-paying the state fee. The previously paid state fee will be returned to the user in accordance with the Tax Code of the RK. The result of the provision of the state service will be issued by the employee of the territorial subdivision of the migration service in the corresponding registration point on the basis of the registration ticket number of the application. The document was developed to improve the process and increase the efficiency of providing state services, as well as to organize the work on improving the quality of service to the population on issues of issuing passports and identity documents to citizens of the RK. The pilot project is planned to be implemented by March 31, 2026. The project is posted on the 'Open NPA' portal for public discussion until March 19, 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: March 04, 2025 03:58 AM\nSource:[Zakon.kz](https://www.zakon.kz/pravo/6469142-kazakhstantsy-smogut--menyat-udostoverenie-lichnosti-v-onlainformate.html)\n\n**Kazakhstan to Introduce Online Service for Replacing Expired Identity Documents**\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Migration Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan have prepared a decree to introduce an online service for replacing expired identity documents and passports.

This program offers up to 55,000 visas annually to individuals from countries with low migration rates to the US. The goal is to promote cultural diversity in the country and give citizens of underrepresented nations the opportunity to obtain permanent residence. Unlike other immigration processes, the visa lottery does not require a labor or family sponsor. The selected individuals can apply for permanent residence after completing a verification process and meeting the established requirements. To be eligible, applicants must meet the following requirements: 'have a high school education or its equivalent, or have at least two years of work experience within the past five years in an occupation that requires at least two years of training or experience.' It is essential to note that applicants must meet both requirements (education and work experience) to be considered eligible. The registration process for the visa lottery is free and online through the official website of the Department of State. The results of the visa lottery are published on the Department of State's website, usually between May and July of the following year after registration. Applicants must log in with their confirmation number to check if they were selected. It is crucial to note that the government agency does not send notifications by email, phone, or postal mail. Therefore, applicants must be attentive to the publication dates and check their status online. The Diversity Visa Program represents an accessible option for obtaining a green card without the need for sponsorship. With clear requirements and a structured process, it provides the possibility of permanent residence. To increase the chances of success, it is essential to meet all the criteria, submit the application within the established deadlines, and follow carefully each stage of the process. Staying informed through official channels ensures a proper participation and avoids potential scams or errors in the processing.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2025 01:19 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/visas-y-tramites/green-card-la-via-para-obtener-la-residencia-permanente-sin-tantos-requisitos-y-sin-patrocinador-nid15022025/)\n\n**March 2025 Visa Bulletin - Some Cracks in the Ice**\nThe US Department of State has published the March Visa Bulletin, which shows modest improvements in all regions and most categories.

However, the EB-4 category has been retrogressed by approximately 18 months to August 1, 2019, and may become unavailable in the near future due to high demand. The monthly Visa Bulletin is essential for individuals navigating the U.S. green card process, providing two key sets of dates: Filing Dates and Final Action Dates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 06:57 AM\nSource:[bizzbuzz.news](https://www.bizzbuzz.news/international/us-visa-bulletin-march-2025-key-green-card-updates-for-indians-1351996)\n\n**March 2025 US Visa Bulletin: Good News for Indians in Employment-Based Visa Categories**\nThe US Department of State has released the March 2025 visa bulletin, which shows improvements in the employment-based visa categories for Indians. The final action dates for EB-2 and EB-3 categories have moved forward by six weeks for Indians. The final action date for EB-2 category is now December 1, 2012, and for EB-3 category is now February 1, 2013. The EB-4 category has been stagnant for almost a year and a half, with a final action date of August 1, 2019.

The EB-5 category also remains unchanged, with a final action date of February 1, 2022. The family-sponsored visa categories for Indians remain unchanged, with no movement in the final action dates. The employment-based first preference (EB-1) category remains unchanged, with a final action date of February 1, 2022. The second preference (EB-2) category has moved forward, with a final action date of December 1, 2012. The third preference (EB-3) category has also moved forward, with a final action date of February 1, 2013.

With up to 55,000 visas available, this initiative, created by the Immigration Act of 1990, aims to diversify immigration to the country by benefiting citizens of nations with low migration rates to the United States. The registration was open from October 2 to November 7, 2024, and was completely free. The results of the selection process will be available in May 2025, marking the beginning of the procedures for those lucky enough to be selected. According to the Department of State, the selection process is completely random and automated, and the results will be accessible only on the official program website: dvprogram.state.gov. To check if you were selected, you will need the confirmation number you received at the time of registration. It is essential to note that selected individuals will not receive emails or phone calls to notify them. Any communication outside of the official website may be an attempt to scam. The Department of State has warned about possible scams and recommends that participants only verify their status on the official page to avoid falling prey to deceit. The period for checking the results will remain open until the end of September 2026. However, it is advised to act quickly once confirmed, as visas are allocated until the annual limit is reached or the fiscal year ends. Being selected in the lottery does not automatically guarantee the issuance of a Green Card. Selected individuals must complete a series of additional steps to formalize their permanent residence. According to the program, the main actions they must take include: 'The Department of State has established clear criteria for granting permanent residence.
