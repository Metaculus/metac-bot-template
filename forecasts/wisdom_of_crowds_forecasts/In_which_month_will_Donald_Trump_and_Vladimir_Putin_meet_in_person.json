Klimkin describes the relationship between Trump and Putin as having a 'unique chemistry', but notes that it is unclear how it will play out. He also states that Trump is in a stronger position than Putin, having achieved 'real results' in the first few weeks of his presidency and gaining support from the American people.

            "initial_reasoning": "To establish initial probabilities, I analyzed diplomatic meetings between high-profile leaders, observing that preparation and logistics often delay meetings, particularly when these involve politically sensitive figures. Typically, such meetings may be announced with a lead time of 1-3 months, especially if the meeting is planned to address significant geopolitical issues. Given the current date is mid-February 2025, a meeting announced for February seems unlikely if no announcements have been made so far.",

If there is an increased campaign or discussion around a potential meeting, leaders may expedite or delay meetings to match public sentiment or strategic communications. Given no significant digital campaigns have yet indicated an imminent meeting, this factor slightly affects the likelihood of a March meeting.",
