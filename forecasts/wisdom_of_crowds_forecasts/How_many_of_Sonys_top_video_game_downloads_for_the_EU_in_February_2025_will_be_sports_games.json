Anastasia Romanova, an analyst at Moneyplace, stated that in 2024, around 1000-1500 gaming consoles were sold per day in non-peak seasons. However, in 2025, this number rose to over 2700 units per day. In total, around 25,000 consoles were sold on marketplaces during the specified period, generating a revenue of 257.7 million rubles. The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Kaja Kallas, proposed banning the import of gaming consoles to Russia in January, specifically mentioning PlayStation and Xbox. Maxim Kondratev, an expert, described this move as 'a hysteria or an attempt to divert attention.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 11:03 AM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://aif.ru/society/v-rf-vyros-spros-na-igrovye-pristavki-na-fone-veroyatnogo-zapreta-postavok)\n\n**PS Plus Extra February 2025 games - Assassin's Creed, Hogwarts Legacy, Robocop**\nFans believe Sony has a special lineup for PS Plus Extra in February.

Hogwarts Legacy, heavily discounted recently, is also a likely candidate. Other games tipped to appear include Robocop, Atomic Heart, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and annual sports games like College Football 25, EA Sports UFC, and NBA 2K25.

The head of EU diplomacy, Kaja Kallas, proposed banning the sale of consoles in Russia in January. Although Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony officially stopped supplying consoles to Russia in 2022, Kallas wants to target those who resell consoles from the EU in Russia. She believes that consoles are used to control drones. 'The end of January and the beginning of February are traditionally a quiet period for console sellers, but this year's sales may have been boosted by the news of a possible ban on the import of PlayStation and Xbox consoles to Russia. If last year, during periods of low demand, around 1,000-1,500 consoles were sold per day on marketplaces, then from January 28 to February 5, over 2,700 consoles were sold,' said Moneyplace analyst Anastasia Romanova. In total, almost 25,000 consoles were sold on marketplaces during this period, with a total revenue of 257.7 million rubles. Last year, interest in consoles also grew, with sales revenue on Ozon and Wildberries increasing by 124% to 3.93 billion rubles, and a total of 982,900 units of consoles and controllers sold, which is 135% higher than in 2023. The PlayStation 5 remains the most popular gaming console. Analysts believe that many users prefer consoles and controllers because they are cheaper than gaming computers, but still allow playing modern games. 'There are several reasons for this dynamics. Consoles and controllers are still a popular gift. Given the growth of income and purchasing power of the population, which official statistics have recorded throughout 2024, it's no surprise that sales of these products have increased. Another factor is the widespread penetration of online marketplaces, which allows selling consoles and controllers in cities and regions of Russia where large electronics retail chains are not present,' added Moneyplace.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 10:14 AM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20250210/spros-1998390336.html)\n\n**Free Prime Gaming February 2025 Titles Have Been revealed!**\nPrime Gaming has revealed its free offerings for February 2025, including 20 new titles for PC gamers.

'It's a great game for those who want to experience the thrill of skateboarding without the risk of injury,' said a gamer.
