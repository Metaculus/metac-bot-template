Bloomberg estimates a y-o-y growth of 4.8%, while UOB Global Economics & Markets Research estimates 5%. Inflation data is also expected from China and India, with ING predicting a modest y-o-y uptick to around 0.4% in China.

This is a significant increase of almost twice the amount over the past four years, despite the COVID-19 restrictions and sanctions. The real GDP growth rate has also been revised upwards to 4.1% in 2024, exceeding expectations. The Ministry of Economic Development notes that this result was achieved despite the challenges, and that the previous record was set over a period of ten years. The high real GDP growth rate has been maintained for the second year, with the third revision of Rosstat's data for 2023 increasing it to 4.1% from 3.6%. The decline in 2022 has also been revised to -1.4% from -1.2%. The changes in the data are largely due to the revision of the GDP deflator, which continues to grow at a faster rate than production. The deflator for 2022 was revised to 18.2% from 15.7%, and for 2023 to 8% from 7%. The current estimate for 2024 is 8.9%. The Ministry of Economic Development had planned for a 3.8% increase in prices in the industry, but the actual figure was 15.5% in extraction and 10% in processing. The structure of GDP in 2024 was similar to that of 2023, with the share of expenditures on final consumption increasing to 68.8% from 68.4%, driven by the population. The share of gross accumulation remained unchanged, while the share of net exports decreased to 3.8% from 4.2%. According to analysts at the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMAS), the economy 'has found itself in the zone of inflationary growth, with the inflation rate exceeding economic growth.' The nominal GDP in dollars in 2024 was approximately $2.16 trillion, or $14,800 per capita, according to estimates by analysts at the Telegram channel MMI. This is close to the level of 2013, before the sanctions, when the GDP per capita was $15,900. In 2025, the GDP per capita in Russia may reach $15,100, but to achieve this, the government and the Central Bank need to simultaneously reduce inflation and maintain growth with limited stimulation. This task appears complex, as the regulators are struggling with the consequences of previous government spending in the second half of 2024 and the beginning of 2025. However, the data from Rosstat on the state of the economy in December 2024 and some leading indicators show a new surge due to a surge in budget expenditures. However, analysts at Raiffeisenbank do not consider it sustainable, as 'such surges have often been temporary in history,' and in general, they expect a slowdown in growth this year 'taking into account budget consolidation and tight monetary policy.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 06:41 PM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/7495952)\n\n**Dipres does not rule out another spending cut this year due to fiscal deficit**\nJaviera Mart\u00ednez, the director of the Direcci\u00f3n de Presupuestos (Dipres), has not ruled out the possibility of another spending cut this year due to the expected fiscal deficit in 2025. According to the Informe de Finanzas P\u00fablicas (IFP) for the fourth quarter of 2024, the fiscal deficit for 2024 was 3.2% of the GDP, exceeding the 1.9% target. The IFP also predicts that the fiscal deficit will exceed the target in 2025, with a deterioration of 1.6% of the GDP. Martinez stated, 'We are thinking that these corrective measures will contemplate both 2025 and 2026.' She also mentioned that 'it's not descartable that there could be a new fiscal spending adjustment during this year.' The current preventive adjustment of 629 million pesos for this year is not enough to meet the fiscal target of -1.1%, according to Martinez. 'We want to present the IFP for the first semester of this year as soon as possible to show the corrective actions dictated by the law,' she added.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 02:06 PM\nSource:[Cooperativa](https://cooperativa.cl/noticias/economia/presupuesto/dipres-no-descarta-otro-recorte-de-gastos-este-ano-tras-prever/2025-02-09/102937.html)\n\n**US Labor Market Shows Resilience Despite Initial Disappointment**\nDespite initial disappointment with the January job numbers, the US labor market showed surprising resilience. New hires fell short of expectations, increasing by only 143,000 to 256,000 outside of agriculture. However, revisions to the previous two months' numbers were significant, with 100,000 added jobs each. The total number of jobs for 2024 was revised downward by around 600,000. The usual large January revisions also affected other statistics, with the number of employed individuals increasing by 2.1 million, including 2 million employed and 100,000 unemployed. This led to a decline in the unemployment rate from 4.1% to 4.0% and an increase in the employment rate from 62.6% to 62.5%. Wages also showed robust growth, increasing by 0.5% from 0.3% in the previous month to 4.1% in the year-over-year comparison. According to Christian Scherrmann, US economist, 'the underlying numbers are stronger than the disappointing new hires suggest, and the labor market seems to have gained momentum by the end of 2024 and into early 2025.' Strong upward revisions to population estimates are likely due to immigration in 2024, which could provide a hawkish input for the US central bank. Recent trends indicate a likely decrease in foreign labor supply, which could lead to further wage increases.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[4investors.de](https://www.4investors.de/nachrichten/boerse.php?sektion=stock&ID=181786)\n\n**B\u00f6rsenwoche: Inflation Data and Central Bank Statements in Focus**\nThe upcoming week in the stock market will be dominated by important inflation data, economic indicators, and statements from central banks.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, NASDAQ 100 rose 0.1%, and DJ dropped 0.5%. The decline was triggered by the release of the BLS labor market data and new statements from Donald Trump. The Nonfarm Payrolls increased by 143,000 in January, beating the forecast of 169,000. The unemployment rate decreased to 4% from 4.1% (forecast: 4.1%). The average hourly earnings grew by 4.1% year-over-year (forecast: 3.8%). The ISM in the manufacturing sector rose to 50.9 points, while the services sector index fell to 52.8 points. According to the GDPNow service, the US GDP may have grown by 2.9% in the first quarter, down from the previous estimate of 3.9%. Mexico and Canada reached an agreement with Trump to delay new tariffs, while China announced new tariffs on some US goods, an antitrust investigation into Google, and restrictions on the export of minerals. Trump announced that he will impose retaliatory tariffs on countries that impose tariffs on US goods next week, without specifying which countries will be affected. The earnings season continues, with 62% of S&P 500 companies having reported their Q4 results. Alphabet, Amazon, Uber Technologies, and AMD fell by 7.3%, 4.1%, 7.6%, and 6.3%, respectively, in the past two trading sessions. Key events to watch include consumer and producer inflation, retail sales, and industrial production. The CPI will be the key indicator of the week. The publication of heavyweight earnings reports is almost complete, with McDonald's, Coca-Cola, and Cisco set to report next week. Trump's statements and potential reactions to them will also be closely watched. The S&P 500 has lost 1% since February 7, 2024, and is currently trading at 6026 points. A scenario of a decline to 5880 points is possible, with resistance levels at 6145 and 6260 points, representing 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci projections from the August 2024 wave.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 04:08 AM\nSource:[bcs-express.ru](https://bcs-express.ru/novosti-i-analitika/amerika-na-mosbirzhe-proval-naia-piatnitsa)\n\n**Chilean Government Lowers Economic Growth Forecast to 2.5% for 2025**\nThe Chilean government has revised its economic growth forecast for this year to 2.5%, while increasing its inflation prediction, according to the Public Finance Report for the fourth quarter of 2024. The report states that the country's economic performance would be better than the 2.4% expansion it achieved last year. 'The current scenario considers a 2.5% GDP growth for 2025, highlighting a significant recovery of investment. This is due to a 3.9% annual increase in gross fixed capital formation, which strongly rebounded after the decline in 2024,' said the Budget Office. The average annual inflation rate would reach 4.7% this year, above the previously projected 4.2%. 'This correction is largely influenced by higher inflation concentrated in the first months of the year, normalizing towards the rest of 2025.' The government also estimated a lower average price for copper, the country's main export, at $4.26 per dollar, below its previous estimate of $4.30. Domestic demand is expected to grow by 2.5% in 2025, below the previous estimate of 3.4%. Between 2026-2029, the mining GDP is expected to be lower than previously estimated, with a growth rate of 2.7% and 2.5% in 2026 and 2027, respectively, before converging to a growth rate of 2.0% in 2028 and 2029. 'The medium-term scenario contemplates that local activity will transition to its trend growth rates towards the end of the projection period,' it noted.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[larepublica.co](https://www.larepublica.co/globoeconomia/gobierno-chileno-recorta-proyeccion-de-crecimiento-economico-a-2-5-para-este-ano-4057766)\n\n**Government Makes Projections for 2025 with Average Dollar at $4,360 and Brent at $74.3**\nThe Ministry of Finance, led by Minister Diego Guevara, presented the 2025 Financial Plan, with macroeconomic projections for the current year. The plan takes into account the negative impact of 2024 on state finances, mainly due to the decline in tax revenue. The government has recalculated the GDP growth rate, lowering it from 3% to 2.6% by the end of this year. The inflation rate for 2025 is projected to be 3.6%. The average exchange rate is expected to be $4,360, while the Brent oil barrel is expected to trade at an average of $74.3. Minister Guevara stated, 'We have updated the GDP growth rate to 1.8% for the previous year. It is essential to mention that we have made an adjustment to the growth perspective in the 2024 fiscal framework, which was at 3% and we adjusted it to 2.6% for this year's growth.' The minister highlighted that it is positive that the country maintains its growth path, considering that the GDP growth rate in 2023 was 0.6%. The recovery of the economy is expected to be driven by a stronger dynamism in activities such as agriculture, livestock, and entertainment, as well as the recovery of sectors such as construction and civil works. The minister emphasized that there is optimism about the dynamism in household consumption, fixed investment, and exports, which would allow consolidating the growth data for the end of the previous year. For 2025, the favorable behavior of internal demand, combined with increased consumption and potential investment, would drive the increase in GDP by the end of the year. Additionally, the government is correcting the current account deficit progressively. Minister Guevara stated, 'It is essential to take into account that, despite the fact that the interest rate decline speed will be lower this year, we must consider the lags of monetary policy, which will be seen this year, and will be transmitted in better rates, which will improve financing and consumption conditions.' The government faced challenges in 2024, mainly due to the decline in tax revenue. Despite this, the minister emphasized that the Fiscal Rule was met. The government collected $18.5 billion less in 2024 than in 2023, and $13.9 billion less than estimated in the medium-term fiscal framework for 2024, resulting in a cut of $28.4 billion in the General Budget. The deficit fiscal was 6.8% of GDP, compared to 3.2% in 2023. The government has made an effort to control the fiscal deficit, which is expected to be financed with $104.7 billion in disbursements, including $35.6 billion in foreign debt and $68.8 billion in local debt. The local debt will be composed of $45 billion in ordinary TES, $1.5 billion in green TES, and $22.3 billion in operations and payment of pension bonds. The financing for 2025 will come from 66% of operations in local currency and 34% of instruments in foreign currency. The minister emphasized that the government is monitoring the evolution of revenues to ensure that the target aligns with its fiscal strategy, with the effective availability of resources to protect public finances. The government's strategy, which demonstrated its effectiveness in the second half of 2024, will help to face the rigidity of the Colombian public budget structure, which limits discretionary spending adjustments, hinders the implementation of the government's agenda, and affects mainly the resources allocated to public investment, which are essential to drive long-term growth. The government's revenues, excluding tax revenues, reached $279.228 million by the end of 2024, while tax revenues reached $243.578 million. With the update of the 2025 Financial Plan, the figure closed at $327.948 million, $48.719 million more. The General Budget for 2025 was $343.161 million, and with the update of the Financial Plan, it was $327.948 million, $15.214 million less. The total expenditure for 2024 by the government closed at $394.651 million, a figure lower than the updated one with the 2025 Financial Plan, which reached $418.749 million, $24.098 million more. The PGN's total consolidated expenditure reached $427.389 million. The financial surpluses at the end of 2024 were $25.035 million, and by the PGN, the figure was $19.526 million. With the new Financial Plan, the figure was $21.598 million, $3.437 million less. The primary balance of the fulfillment of the Fiscal Rule for 2024 was -$40.978 million, and with the update of the 2025 Financial Plan, the figure decreased to $1.215 million, ensuring sustainability. The economic ministry made a re-evaluation of the economic projections in accordance with what is being seen in the last days. Yesterday, the Dane reported that the IPC data for January reflected a slight increase compared to December, at 5.22%. Although in the course of the year, it has been evident that its trend continues to decline. One of the main reasons for the increase of 0.94% compared to the end of 2024 was the increase in the minimum wage, although the government considers that inflation will continue to decline for the remainder of the year.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[larepublica.co](https://www.larepublica.co/economia/gobierno-hace-cuentas-para-2025-con-el-dolar-promedio-en-4-360-y-brent-a-us-74-3-4057459)\n\n**US GDP grows 2.3% in last quarter of 2024, defying recession predictions**\nThe US GDP grew by 2.3% in the last quarter of 2024, showing a deceleration after the 3.1% expansion in the previous quarter, according to data published by the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). In comparison to the last quarter of 2023, the GDP growth was 0.6%, and for the entire year 2024, the US economy expanded by 2.8% compared to 2023, below the 2.9% growth rate of the previous year. According to the BEA's initial calculations, the slowdown in growth in the last three months of the year was due to the decline in investment and exports. However, the main driver of the economy, consumption, grew strongly at a rate of 4.7% in the fourth quarter. Despite the deceleration compared to the strong pace of the July to September quarter, the economy defied last year's recession predictions that emerged after the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 to contain inflation. As reported by the BEA, the economy has been resilient and has shown a solid growth, which has been supported by the president's plans to cut taxes and reduce regulations, as well as the backing of large US corporations. However, the private sector is concerned that the tariffs announced by Trump will increase production costs. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada starting tomorrow, February 1, in retaliation for the flow of fentanyl and irregular migration at the border.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 03:07 PM\nSource:[elheraldo.co](https://www.elheraldo.co/economia/2025/01/30/el-pib-de-estados-unidos-crecio-un-23-en-el-ultimo-trimestre-de-2024/)\n\n**US GDP growth in Q4 likely to confirm steady economic expansion**\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is set to release the preliminary estimate of the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the October-December quarter on Thursday.

The report will also include fresh Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) - Price Index figures, the Federal Reserve's (Fed) favourite inflation gauge. Valeria Bednarik, FXStreet Chief Analyst, notes that a better-than-anticipated GDP headline could support the Fed's dovish case and pressure the US Dollar, while discouraging figures could have the opposite effect. According to Bednarik, 'A decline below 107.75, the January 29 intraday low, exposes the monthly bottom at 106.97. Still, and given the risk-averse environment, US Dollar dips could be seen as buying opportunities, with additional falls unlikely in the near term.'

This is up from the previous estimate of 2.8% and matches the forecasted 3.1% growth. The acceleration in real GDP was primarily driven by increases in consumer spending, exports, nonresidential fixed investment, and federal government spending.

The BEA also revised the annual growth rate between July and September to 3.1%, three-tenths higher than previously projected. This is the second revision of the data, following an initial estimate in October and a first revision in November. The growth rate is slightly higher than the 0.7% growth rate in the second quarter, when the US GDP grew 3% annually. The increase in real GDP was mainly driven by increases in consumer spending, exports, federal government spending, and non-residential fixed investment. Importantly, imports also increased. The data confirms the strength of the US economy, coming a day after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the third time in a row. The Fed reduced rates by one point, to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, and its chairman, Jerome Powell, hinted at a slower pace of rate cuts in 2025. The inflation rate rose to 2.7% in November, its second consecutive increase.

Consumer spending, in particular, has been a key factor in growth, even as Americans have felt the pinch of rising living costs, thanks to a healthy labor market. 'Compared to the second quarter, the acceleration of real GDP in the third quarter mainly reflected the acceleration of exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending,' said the Commerce Department on Thursday. The data confirms the strength of the US economy and comes a day after the Federal Reserve of the United States (Fed) lowered interest rates for the third consecutive time. The central bank applied a cut of one point, to a range of 4.25 to 4.5%, and its president, Jerome Powell, anticipated a slower pace of cuts for 2025. The inflation rate rose again in November, for the second consecutive month, and rose a tenth to 2.7%. The rate cut was the last decision of the Fed under the mandate of Democrat Joe Biden, as Republican Donald Trump will take power in the next meeting, scheduled for January 28-29. 'The composition of the revisions reinforces our conviction that the economy is solidly based and that 2025 will be another good year,' said Ryan Sweet, chief economist for the US at Oxford Economics. Despite the boost from consumer spending, Sweet warned of variations depending on household income. Households with high incomes 'are reaping the benefits of an adjusted labor market, increased housing, and stock wealth,' while households with lower incomes continue to face financial pressure, he said, and added that it is unlikely to change next year. He also warned of volatile inventories and net exports, especially in the first half of next year, amid the threat of tariffs from President-elect Donald Trump. It is likely that companies will bring forward some imports in anticipation of the tariffs.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 04:15 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/estados-unidos/2024/12/19/el-pbi-de-estados-unidos-crecio-el-31-interanual-superando-los-pronosticos/)\n\n**US GDP Growth Revised Upward to 3.1% in Third Quarter**\nThe US GDP growth in the third quarter was revised upward to 3.1% annualized, according to the latest estimate from the Department of Commerce. The revision was justified by 'an upward revision of exports and consumer spending', while private investment was partially revised downward. This data is better than expected by analysts, who pointed to continued growth at 2.8%. The Department of Commerce also confirmed that the second-quarter growth was 3% annualized. The annualized rate compares the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the previous quarter and projects its evolution for the entire year at that rate. The first estimate of GDP growth for the fourth and final quarter and for the entire year of 2024 will be released on January 30.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 03:09 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/crescimento-do-pib-dos-eua-no-3-o-trimestre-revisto-em-alta-para-31/)\n\n**US GDP grows 0.8% in third quarter of 2024, exceeding forecast**\nThe US Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported that the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 0.8% in the third quarter of 2024, exceeding the initial forecast by 0.1 percentage points. This is the second revision of the data, following an initial estimate in October and a first revision in November. The GDP growth rate for the quarter was 3.1%, 0.3 percentage points higher than previously projected. The growth was driven by increases in consumer spending, exports, federal government spending, and non-residential fixed investment. The data confirms the strength of the US economy, which was announced a day after the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the third consecutive time. The Fed reduced the interest rate by 1 percentage point, to a range of 4.25-4.5%, and its chairman, Jerome Powell, predicted a slower pace of rate cuts in 2025. The inflation rate rose for the second consecutive month, reaching 2.7% in November. 'Contributing to their economy' is how Claudia Sheinbaum described Mexicans in the US, emphasizing their importance to the US economy. However, the Fed's decision was the last under the mandate of President Joe Biden, as the Republican Donald Trump will take office in the next meeting, scheduled for January 28-29.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 02:33 PM\nSource:[El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cartera/pib-de-estados-unidos-crecio-08-en-tercer-trimestre-de-2024-es-una-decima-mas-de-lo-previsto/)\n\n**US GDP Growth Revised Upwards to 3.1% in Third Quarter**\nThe US economy has seen a revision in the third quarter GDP growth rate from 2.8% to 3.1%. This increase is mainly due to 'revisions upwards of exports and consumer spending that were partially offset by a downward revision of private investment in inventories'. Imports, which are a subtraction in the GDP calculation, were also revised upwards. Compared to the third quarter of 2023, the GDP growth reflected 'increases in consumer spending, exports, non-residential fixed investment, and federal government spending'. The US economy has accelerated since the second quarter, where the GDP grew 3%. This improvement is due to 'accelerations in exports, consumer spending, and federal government spending', which were partially offset by a deceleration of private investment in inventories and a greater decrease in residential fixed investment. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index remained at 1.5%, while the core inflation indicator was revised upwards to 2.2%. Personal income in current dollars increased by $191.7 billion in the quarter, a revision upwards of $15.8 billion from the previous estimate. Disposable personal income increased by $141.5 billion, or 2.7%, after being revised upwards by $18.6 billion. Oxford Economics analysts believe that the upward revision of GDP was 'a bit larger' than their forecast, which was in turn higher than the consensus forecast. However, they believe that 'the implications for short-term forecasting are small'. 'The composition of the revisions reinforces our conviction that the economy has a solid foundation and that 2025 will be another good year', they add. Initial jobless claims for the week ending December 14 fell to 220,000, a decrease of 22,000 from the previous week's level, according to the US Department of Labor. This figure was below the 230,000 consensus forecast. The unemployment rate remained at 1.2%, and the number of unemployed workers decreased to 1,874,000, a decrease of 5,000 from the previous period.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 02:20 PM\nSource:[ecobolsa.com](https://www.ecobolsa.com/noticias/eeuu-revisa-alza-crecimiento-pib-tercer-trimestre-31-28.html)\n\n**US Economy Grows 0.8% in Third Quarter, Exceeding Estimates**\nThe US economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2024, exceeding the estimated 0.7% growth rate, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

According to Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, 'The economy is already motoring along at the 3% speed limit,' making it challenging for the incoming president-elect to implement new economic policies. The labor market has also weakened, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.2% and job growth slowing down in October.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2024 01:32 PM\nSource:[washingtonexaminer.com](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/finance-and-economy/3264668/gdp-grew-at-3-1-rate-in-third-quarter-final-revision-shows/)\n\n**Q3 GDP Growth Revised up to 3.1% Annual Rate**\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis has revised the third quarter GDP growth rate up to 3.1% annual rate, according to the 'third' estimate.
