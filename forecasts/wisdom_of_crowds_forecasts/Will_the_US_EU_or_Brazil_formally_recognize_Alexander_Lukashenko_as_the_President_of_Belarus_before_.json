According to the Lukashenko administration, as reported by 'European Truth', Kavlashvili's congratulatory message stated that 'the mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity is the most important foundation for cooperation and relations between nations.' Kavlashvili expressed hope that the Georgian-Belarusian relations will develop for the benefit of their countries and peoples. It is worth noting that the presidential 'elections' in Belarus took place on January 26, with Lukashenko 'winning' over 87% of the votes, with no independent OSCE observers present. The European Union, Australia, the UK, Canada, and New Zealand have already refused to recognize the January 26 'elections' as free and fair.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 04:06 PM\nSource:[eurointegration.com.ua](https://www.eurointegration.com.ua/news/2025/02/18/7205314/)\n\n**Russian State Duma Approves Agreement on Security with Belarus**\nThe State Duma of the Russian Federation has approved the ratification of the agreement on guarantees of security between Russia and Belarus within the framework of the Union State. According to the press service of the State Duma, the document provides for mutual obligations to ensure security in case of threats to their sovereignty or territorial integrity. The agreement includes mutual assistance, including political, military, and other measures, in case of threats from third countries, international organizations, terrorist, or extremist groups. According to Vyacheslav Volodin, speaking on February 17, the ratification of the agreement is aimed at protecting the citizens and territory of the two states primarily from provocations by neighboring EU member states. One of the most significant components of the agreement is the possibility of deploying Russian tactical nuclear weapons on Belarusian territory. Russian Ambassador Boris Gryzlov stated that the agreement contributes to the formation of a unified defensive space on the external borders of the Union State. The agreement was signed in December 2024 by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk. In February 2025, the document was submitted to parliament for ratification, with President Putin designating Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko as the official representative in the consideration of this issue.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/gosduma-odobrila-dogovor-o-bezopasnosti-s-belorussiej-566945.html)\n\n**Lukashenko Assures Haftar of Belarus' Support**\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko welcomed Libyan Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar to the Palace of Independence on February 18, 2025.

Lukashenko stated, 'If you want to buy something abroad, let's work out a system so that no one attaches themselves to you. But if you hide your money earned here abroad, what should my attitude towards you be?' The move is seen as a logical step, as the government has already taken significant amounts from foreign investors. In 2022, the government restricted the right of investors from unfriendly countries to manage their property, and in 2023, they prohibited them from transferring profits and dividends abroad. However, despite these measures, direct foreign investment in Belarus decreased to $5.2 billion in 2024, down from $5.8 billion in the previous year. Lukashenko has expressed frustration with the quality of investments, particularly from Russia, and has accused foreign investors of taking money out of the country rather than investing it. He has promised to provide 'the most severe support' to businesses, but has not specified how he plans to do so.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 05:39 AM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u044f 97](https://charter97.org/be/news/2025/2/18/630244/)\n\n**Belarusian President Emphasizes Need for Self-Regulating Price System**\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko emphasized the need for a self-regulating system of price formation, which would not stifle business and production. He stated, 'Let the producer sell, but he must remember that he produced it, and the people who are nearby, they buy it. And they must have the opportunity to buy this product.' The President also noted that prices should not fluctuate, especially upwards, and that the Ministry of Antimonopoly Regulation and Trade should work towards reducing complaints about prices. According to the Minister of Antimonopoly Regulation and Trade, Arthur Karpyovich, the goal is to have fewer complaints about prices, and the trend in recent years has been towards a decrease in complaints. The head of the analytical department of the Ministry of Antimonopoly Regulation and Trade, Irina Ivanovskaya, reported that the inflation rate for 2024 was 5.2%, which is one of the lowest in the Eurasian Economic Union. In January 2025, the inflation rate remained at 5.2%. The Committee for State Control reported that there were instances of price manipulation in three stores in the Kaliakinsk, Narovlyansky, and Petrikovsky districts, where prices for vegetables and fruits were higher than the allowed maximum. However, it was noted that such cases are rare, and most private stores in the country operate fairly. The head of the main department of trade and services of the Gomel Oblast Executive Committee, Alexander Kachan, stated that the sale of products is under control, and the demand for stable food products remains high. Residents of rural areas, such as Galiya Parazhinskaya from the village of Batevichi, prefer to shop at cooperative stores, where they can buy fresh produce and other essential goods at reasonable prices.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 18, 2025 05:08 AM\nSource:[\u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0443\u0441\u044c \u0421\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f](https://www.sb.by/articles/ne-vyshe-predelnoy.html)\n\n**President Orders Decriminalization of Economic Risks**\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has instructed to decriminalize economic risks. He stated that the country needs to focus on this issue, as there are unscrupulous business entities and isolated cases that cast a shadow of distrust on the entire business community. Lukashenko emphasized that the government will not create artificial barriers due to a few scammers, but will approach the issue with pragmatism and common sense. He added that decisions should be made in the interests of the economy. According to Lukashenko, the government and private sectors, as well as foreign companies, should work for the common good of the people and the country. Business representatives, including those interviewed by '\u042d\u0413', have repeatedly pointed out the importance of decriminalizing tax offenses, citing the example of Russia, where a law was passed in 2023 to automatically dismiss a criminal case if the tax debt, penalties, and fines are fully paid. In Belarus, however, a person must not only pay the fine, penalties, and tax debt, but also a criminal-law compensation equal to the amount of the debt, which is often impossible to do. Therefore, Belarusian business unions are advocating for a review of approaches to punishing tax offenses, taking into account Russian practice.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[neg.by](https://neg.by/novosti/otkrytj/prezident-poruchil-provesti-dekriminalizatsiyu-ekonomicheskikh-riskov/)\n\n**Lukashenko Promises to Support Honest Business Owners**\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has promised to 'harshly support' private business owners who 'honestly work' for the benefit of Belarus. Lukashenko vowed to provide equal conditions for all business representatives, regardless of ownership form, 'who honestly work for the state, for the people, by law, and pay taxes.' He emphasized that the private sector will be supported, but only if they are 'clean and transparent, like glass.' Lukashenko assured that if this condition is met, 'no one will take away your business, no one will lean on you, and no one will divide anything.' He cited the example of the Russian e-commerce platform Wildberries, which he said the Belarusian government is willing to support, as long as it helps fill the domestic market with local products and does not lead to monopolization and closure of small shops. 'Any enterprise must work for Belarus, for the state. Then I will have no complaints about you,' Lukashenko said.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 11:21 AM\nSource:[telegraf.news](https://telegraf.news/ehkonomika/skazhite-kto-meshaet-golova-sletit-s-ljubogo-lukashenko-poobeshhal-zhestoko-podderzhivat-etih-biznesmenov/)\n\n**Lukashenko Demands Equal Treatment for Private and State-Owned Enterprises**\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko held a meeting with representatives of private Belarusian enterprises on February 17 and demanded that private and state-owned enterprises be put on an equal footing. Lukashenko emphasized that there are no 'non-state' people in Belarus, only private and state-owned enterprises. He called on both business and officials to 'act exclusively in the interests of the economy.' Lukashenko stated that the government is just as interested as entrepreneurs in seeing the private and state sectors, as well as foreign enterprises, 'work for the common good of people and the country.' He emphasized the need to 'put private and state-owned forms of enterprise ownership on an equal footing.' Lukashenko also highlighted the need to 'decriminalize economic risks' and warned that the actions of a few 'unscrupulous individuals' should not create artificial barriers for the business community. 'We will not build artificial barriers due to a few scammers,' Lukashenko said.

When asked by journalists who he voted for, Lukashenko replied, 'I must be honest: I voted for all!' He also stated that he is in dialogue with his opponents, whom he referred to as the opposition. Lukashenko dismissed the EU's sharp criticism of the election process and showed no concern about the EU's announcement that it will not recognize the election. He said, 'It will have no impact on us whether the European Union recognizes our election or not. Believe me, it's absolutely irrelevant to me whether you recognize our election or not. What's important to me is that the Belarusians recognize this election and that it ends as peacefully as it began.' The EU Parliament had previously condemned the election as a sham on January 22, calling on EU member states and the international community not to recognize Lukashenko's legitimacy as president after January 26, 2025. Lukashenko dismissed this criticism, saying that it's impossible to evaluate something that has not yet happened. He also stated that the value of the EU Parliament's statement is zero. The early voting for the presidential election in Belarus began on January 21, and five candidates are running for the highest office in the country: Oleg Gaidukewitsch, Anna Kanopazkaja, Sergei Syrankow, Alexander Chischnjak, and Lukashenko himself. The election is taking place from 8 to 20 local time, with over 5,000 polling stations open across the country. For the first time in Belarus' history, there are no polling stations abroad due to security reasons and a lack of personnel in diplomatic missions. Approximately 6.9 million citizens are eligible to vote, and the election is considered complete if more than half of the voters cast their ballots.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 02:51 PM\nSource:[rt.com](https://de.rt.com/europa/234422-lukaschenko-zu-eu-es-ist/)\n\n**Lukashenko Responds to Question About Searching for a Successor**\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that he is not currently searching for a successor to transfer power, according to BelTA. 'I am not looking for this successor... We are living through these elections now. After the elections, we will think about it,' he said. Lukashenko emphasized the need to focus on successfully navigating the 2025 year and building the country's future by developing cooperation with Russia and avoiding dependence on Western countries. Belarus is currently holding presidential elections, with voting taking place on January 26. The election is being held without the presence of Western observers, and the Belarusian authorities have not opened polling stations abroad due to 'security concerns' and a reduction in the Belarusian diplomatic corps in some countries. The election features five candidates, including incumbent President Lukashenko, Oleg Gaidukevich, a deputy of the House of Representatives and leader of the Liberal-Democratic Party, Anna Kanopatskaya, a businessman and former deputy of the House of Representatives, Sergey Syranek, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and Alexander Khizhnyak, the chairman of the Republican Party of Labor and Justice. Two of the candidates, Gaidukevich and Syranek, have already acknowledged Lukashenko's victory.

He questioned what the EU would do if the US made a statement or remained silent about the election. Commenting on the European Parliament's resolution, which called for not recognizing Lukashenko's 'expected victory', the president called it 'a groveling before the older brothers in Washington'. Lukashenko asked how it is possible to evaluate something that has not yet occurred and urged to consider the resolution as a given fact. He also noted that the EU's statement did not harm Belarus, but rather was beneficial to it. The presidential election in Belarus is scheduled for January 26. Four other candidates are running against Lukashenko: Oleg Gaidukevich, Anna Kanopatskaya, Sergei Syarankou, and Alexander Khizhnyak. Two of the candidates, Gaidukevich and Syarankou, have already recognized Lukashenko's victory before the election. If Lukashenko wins, it will be his seventh presidential term, as he has been in office since 1994 and is the first and currently the only president of Belarus.

The European Parliament also calls for free and fair elections in the country. A vote on the anti-Belarusian resolution is scheduled for Wednesday, January 22. Belarus' Central Election Commission head Igor Karpenko has stated that they are prepared for different scenarios during the presidential election, amidst the current 'aggressive' geopolitical environment.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 21, 2025 03:57 PM\nSource:[RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c](https://russian.rt.com/world/news/1424021-ep-vybory-v-belorussii)\n\n",

                    "points_challenging_prior_analysis": "The news doesn't directly indicate any shift in policy from the US, EU, or Brazil towards recognition of Lukashenko. Yet, the involvement of Belarus in international dialogues, like the Russian-US talks or interactions with neutral states such as Libya, might suggest an attempt to gain wider diplomatic traction. However, these factors have not led to any concrete change in recognition policies by major Western countries.",
