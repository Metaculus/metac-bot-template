Global players like Mistral AI, OpenAI, and Perplexity are making significant strides in making AI more relevant for consumers and businesses. Sophia Yang, head of developer relations at Mistral AI, unveiled the new Saba model, which is trained on curated datasets from the Middle East and South Asia. Meanwhile, OpenAI updated its GPT-4o model, and Perplexity released its Deep Research tool for free. Voice interactions with AI are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot Voice expanding their language support. According to SenseAI's Annual AI Report 2025, enterprises invested $13.8 billion in AI during 2024, a sixfold increase from 2023. Microsoft's Chris Young noted, 'Over the past year we've seen significant numbers of people and organisations moving from AI experimentation to more meaningful adoption.' Consumer AI developments continue to advance, with Amazon and Apple planning to enhance their voice assistants and Google making file analysis in Gemini available to free users.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 09:51 AM\nSource:[Hindustan Times](https://www.hindustantimes.com/business/new-ai-models-drive-workplace-transformation-101740130811473.html)\n\n**NSDL IPO before April**\nThe National Securities Depository (NSDL) is planning to launch its initial public offering (IPO) by early April, according to sources. The move is crucial for complying with the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) mandate capping single-entity ownership in market infrastructure institutions at 15 per cent. NSDL's IPO will be an offer for sale (OFS), with six shareholders diluting their stakes, including the National Stock Exchange, IDBI Bank, and HDFC Bank. 'We are planning to squeeze in the IPO within the next month to meet the deadline,' said a company official. The IPO is a critical step for NSDL to align with Sebi's ownership norms, ensuring a diversified shareholder base and reducing concentration risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2025 04:02 AM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://m.rediff.com/news/commentary/2025/feb/21/nsdl-ipo-before-april/fc93176ee3c158de7d39e094f151e4a9)\n\n**NSDL IPO May Come Soon**\nThe National Securities Depository (NSDL) is planning to launch an IPO in early April, according to sources. This move is significant in light of SEBI's rules, which have capped single-unit ownership in market infrastructure institutions at 15%. SEBI had granted NSDL theoretical approval for an IPO in September 2024, and the company had submitted IPO documents in July 2023. With the approval period set to expire in April, NSDL is accelerating the process.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://hindi.business-standard.com/markets/ipo/nsdls-ipo-may-come-soon-id-415663)\n\n**Tripadvisor's Perplexity Deal: AI for Customer Acquisition Is Now a Thing in Travel**\nTripadvisor has formed a successful partnership with AI engine Perplexity, which has led to the acquisition of high-intent customers. The partnership, which began in January, uses an 'AI first funnel' and has shown promising results, with customers who come to Tripadvisor via Perplexity being 'incremental' and 'high intent.' Tripadvisor CEO Matt Goldberg expressed enthusiasm about the early results, stating that the partnership will allow the company to tap into traffic and revenue share, as well as increase brand awareness. Goldberg also mentioned that Tripadvisor will supply Perplexity with experiences and restaurants, in addition to hotels, and that the company is looking for a long-term, durable position in the ecosystem. The partnership is part of Tripadvisor's strategy to expand its AI collaborations and officially launch a membership program by 2025. Additionally, Tripadvisor's Viator and TheFork brands have become increasingly important to the company's revenue, now contributing over half of its total income.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 04:28 PM\nSource:[Skift](https://skift.com/2025/02/20/tripadvisors-perplexity-deal-ai-for-customer-acquisition-is-now-a-thing-in-travel/)\n\n**NSDL's much-awaited IPO likely before April to meet Sebi ownership cap**\nThe National Securities Depository (NSDL) is planning to launch its initial public offering (IPO) by early April to comply with the Securities and Exchange Board of India's (Sebi) mandate capping single-entity ownership in market infrastructure institutions at 15 per cent.

Altman announced a new update to ChatGPT, which he claimed is 'pretty good' and will soon get much better. Srinivas responded with a joke, referencing a post about the launch of Deep Research for Perplexity. Altman took it in stride, saying he would not hold it against Srinivas since he had apologized for 'mean tweets'. Srinivas claimed that Perplexity AI's new AI offerings are 'an order of magnitude faster and cheaper' than OpenAI tools, despite falling behind in accuracy rankings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2025 10:07 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/since-you-nicely-apologised-openai-s-sam-altman-and-perplexity-ai-ceo-aravind-srinivas-s-banter-wins-hearts-12946317.html)\n\n**Perplexity Releases Censored-Free DeepSeek-R1 Model**\nPerplexity, a startup, has released a censored-free version of its DeepSeek-R1 model, dubbed R1-1776, on Hugging Face. The company aimed to provide users with 'unbiased, accurate' information without compromising the model's reasoning ability. The original R1 model would either refuse to answer certain queries or provide pre-programmed responses, as dictated by the Communist Party of China, according to Perplexity's blog. For example, when asked about the impact of Taiwan's independence on Nvidia's stock price, the model would simply state: 'The Chinese government has always adhered to the principle of 'One China.' Perplexity enlisted experts to identify sensitive topics in China and collected user queries related to these topics. The company then trained a new model using a dataset of missing information and the NeMo 2.0 cloud platform from Nvidia. Perplexity claims to have filtered out queries containing personal information. The updated R1-1776 model now provides more detailed answers to 'sensitive' queries. The model's weights are available for download on Hugging Face, and it can be used through an API. Perplexity also introduced a reasoning mode with DeepSeek-R1 on January 28, 2025, which analyzes sources and provides conclusions alongside its answers. Alternatively, users can choose the o1 model from OpenAI, but only with a $20 monthly subscription (approximately 1,826 rubles as of February 19, 2025).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 02:06 PM\nSource:[vc.ru](https://vc.ru/ai/1822344-startap-perplexity-sdelal-versiyu-deepseek-r1-bez-cenzury-dlya-svoego-ii-poiskovika)\n\n**Perplexity AI Open-Sources R1 1776 to Remove Censorship from DeepSeek-R1**\nPerplexity AI has open-sourced R1 1776, a large language model with reasoning capabilities, to remove censorship from DeepSeek-R1. The original model refused to engage with sensitive topics, particularly those censored by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Perplexity's post-training effort focused on mitigating this issue by gathering a dataset of 40,000 multilingual prompts and developing a multilingual censorship classifier. R1 1776 now provides detailed responses to sensitive topics, such as Taiwan's independence and its potential impact on NVIDIA's stock. Perplexity has also announced that its in-house model, Sonar, will be available to all Pro users on the platform, and launched Deep Research, a tool for autonomously conducting in-depth research and analysis. 'Our value is going to be in providing a great assistant and personalising it to the user, not in the models themselves,' said Perplexity AI chief Aravind Srinivas.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2025 07:17 AM\nSource:[Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/perplexity-ai-open-sources-r1-1776-to-remove-censorship-from-deepseek-r1/)\n\n**Perplexity AI Proposes Merger with TikTok in the US**\nPerplexity AI, a search mechanism startup, has revised its proposal to merge with ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, in the US. The goal is to create a new entity that combines Perplexity's operations with TikTok's short-form video app in the US. According to a source, the proposal was confirmed by Reuters on Sunday. The plan includes the participation of the US government, which aims to hold up to 50% of the new company in a future initial public offering (IPO). This structure would allow the government to have a significant role in the new holding. 'The government would become the owner of up to half of the new entity after the IPO, which is expected to be valued at a minimum of $300 billion,' said a source. Perplexity AI has offered to be acquired by the holding if its investors receive a distribution of the NewCo's assets.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 12:13 AM\nSource:[diariocarioca.com](https://www.diariocarioca.com/tecnologia/perplexity-ai-propoe-fusao-com-tiktok-nos-eua/)\n\n**Perplexity AI Updates its Offer to TikTok US**\nPerplexity AI has revised its takeover offer for TikTok U.S., proposing a new entity that would allow the U.S. government to own up to 50% of the new company upon a future IPO. This aligns with President Trump's statements on the app, where he plans to organize a joint venture with China to keep TikTok available in the U.S. Trump aims to meet the requirements of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, which would ensure U.S. users are protected and the app is not used for information gathering or propaganda purposes. Trump said, 'So whether you like TikTok or not, we're gonna make a lot of money.' The proposal suggests that Trump would prefer the U.S. Government to have influence over the app, similar to how the Chinese government controls the Chinese version of TikTok, Douyin. The sale of TikTok U.S. operations is currently down to Perplexity AI and another group, with the deadline set for April.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 08:25 PM\nSource:[Social Media Today | A business community for the web's best thinkers on Social Media](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/perplexity-ai-tiktok-US-offer-sell-off/738410/)\n\n**Perplexity AI Revives Proposal to Merge with TikTok in the US**\nPerplexity AI, a US-based search engine startup, has revised its proposal to merge with ByteDance, the Chinese parent company of TikTok, to create a new entity combining Perplexity and TikTok's US operations. According to a source familiar with the matter, the proposal suggests that the US government could own up to 50% of the new company in a future initial public offering (IPO). The proposal, outlined in a Perplexity document shared with ByteDance and new investors, involves creating a new holding company in the US called 'NewCo'. Under the plan, ByteDance would sell TikTok's US operations to investors, giving current TikTok shareholders a stake in the company. However, the proposal excludes TikTok's main recommendation algorithm, which ByteDance would retain. The new entity would be valued at least $300 billion, and the US government could own up to half of it after an IPO. Perplexity AI has also offered to be acquired by the holding company if its investors receive a share of the NewCo's assets.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 01:29 PM\nSource:[infomoney.com.br](https://www.infomoney.com.br/business/perplexity-ai-propoe-uma-fusao-com-tiktok-diz-fonte/)\n\n**Perplexity AI proposes to merge with Tiktok, with US government getting half - source**\nPerplexity AI has revised its merger proposal with TikTok US, calling for the US government to own up to 50% of the new company upon a future initial public offering (IPO). The proposal, shared with ByteDance and new investors, would create a new US holding company called 'NewCo', with ByteDance selling TikTok US to the investors. The US government would own up to half of the new structure once it goes through an IPO of a valuation of at least $300 billion. Perplexity AI would also offer to be acquired by the holding company if its own investors received a distribution of the NewCo equity. A person familiar with the proposal said, 'Perplexity AI believes its bid may succeed since the proposal is a merger rather than a sale.' The proposal comes after TikTok services were restored in the US last week, following a law that cited national security. US President Donald Trump said he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in the next 30 days.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 10:59 AM\nSource:[Rappler](https://www.rappler.com/technology/perplexity-ai-proposes-merge-tiktok-us-government-get-half/)\n\n**Perplexity AI fresh TikTok offer calls for $300B IPO**\nPerplexity AI has reportedly modified a proposed merger offer for ByteDance's TikTok US assets, with the US government to take a 50% stake after the platform is listed with a valuation of at least $300 billion. The deal would combine TikTok and Perplexity AI, with ByteDance selling its US platform in return for its existing shareholders receiving equity in a new US holding company. Perplexity AI's investors would receive a stake in the new entity in exchange for their company. This proposal comes after ByteDance was scrambling to work out a deal to keep TikTok operating in the US, following US legislation passed in early 2024 that banned the service unless a local buyer was found. ByteDance board member William Ford said the company hoped to line up an alternative to selling its TikTok assets. Perplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine start-up established in 2024, which raised $500 million in December that year from investors including SoftBank Group and Nvidia.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 09:28 AM\nSource:[mobileworldlive.com](https://www.mobileworldlive.com/north-america/perplexity-ai-fresh-tiktok-offer-calls-for-300b-ipo/)\n\n**Perplexity AI Proposes TikTok Merger with 50% U.S. Stake**\nPerplexity AI has proposed a merger with ByteDance to create a new U.S. company, NewCo, which will combine TikTok U.S. operations with Perplexity AI.

The U.S. government will gain up to 50% ownership of NewCo after an IPO, provided the company reaches a minimum $300 billion valuation.

This move comes in response to growing political and security concerns. The proposal, which is an updated version of a previous plan, suggests that Perplexity and TikTok's US section merge, potentially paving the way for an IPO estimated at $300 billion. The unique aspect of this plan is that the government-held shares would lack voting privileges, ensuring limited interference.

The plan aims to create a new entity, 'NewCo', by merging TikTok's US business (excluding its core algorithm) with Perplexity AI and other investors. According to sources, the revised plan would allow the US government to acquire up to 50% of the shares once the new entity's initial public offering (IPO) reaches $300 billion. This proposal is reportedly modified based on the advice of the Trump administration. The deal would be a merger, not a forced sale, allowing most existing investors to retain their shares. However, sources indicate that ByteDance must allow the US board to have complete control over the new entity. Perplexity AI, launched in 2022, is a chatbot-driven dialogue search engine, valued at $5 billion in early 2024 and $9 billion after a new funding round. Investors believe that AI-assisted search may be one of Google's main challenges, potentially changing the way consumers access information online. This new merger proposal seems to align with the strategy proposed by former US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during the Trump administration. Mnuchin suggested using TikTok's new investors to 'dilute' Chinese ownership, meeting regulatory requirements. Mnuchin also expressed his willingness to invest in the company, stating that technology needs to be 'decoupled' from China and ByteDance. Many investors, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Elon Musk, have expressed interest in acquiring or merging with TikTok. US President Trump stated that he expects to complete the deal within 30 days, saying 'many people are talking to me, very many people' and 'we're very interested, America will be a big beneficiary.' 'Only when America benefits will I do this,' he added.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/1/27/n14422972.htm)\n\n**Perplexity AI Proposes New Merger Plan with TikTok, Allowing US Government to Hold Up to 50% of Shares**\nPerplexity AI, a US-based AI startup, has proposed a new merger plan with TikTok, which would allow the US government to hold up to 50% of the shares in the new entity.
