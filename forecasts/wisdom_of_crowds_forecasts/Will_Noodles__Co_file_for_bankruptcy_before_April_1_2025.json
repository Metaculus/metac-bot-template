The company, which owns the restaurants 'Sugamour' and 'Mollusca', has released a statement saying that all 105 employees will be let go. The reasons for the bankruptcy are due to the company's financial situation, which has been deteriorating since the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the company, the situation began to worsen after the pandemic, and the removal of the additional value-added tax (VAT) exemption for the food industry made things even worse. The company stated that it had tried to control the increasing expenses and declining customer traffic since the beginning of last year, but the losses continued to grow. The company's financial situation in 2024 has been particularly bad, with a loss of 300,000 euros. The restaurants 'Sugamour' and 'Mollusca' will be closing their doors, and the employees will be offered jobs at other companies in the group. The company's financial report for 2023 showed a 15% decrease in revenue to 4.17 million euros, with a net profit of 8.5 thousand euros. The company's financial situation has been deteriorating since the pandemic, and the removal of the VAT exemption has made things even worse.

This is an increase from 780 in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic led to a state of emergency. However, due to government and local financial support measures such as zero-interest loans and subsidies for businesses affected by the pandemic, the number of bankruptcies decreased to 452 in 2022. However, since then, the number of bankruptcies has increased due to the reduction or termination of support measures, the start of repayments for zero-interest loans, and the impact of rising prices due to the rapid depreciation of the yen. In addition, the economic recovery from the pandemic has led to a shortage of labor in various industries, making it difficult for small-scale restaurant businesses to secure funding. The five industries with the most bankruptcies were 'bars, beer halls, and nightclubs' (212), 'Chinese restaurants and other East Asian restaurants' (158), 'Western restaurants' (123), 'noodle and udon shops' (27), and 'other general restaurants' (65). These five industries have set a new record high. In addition, seven industries, including 'Japanese restaurants' (77) and 'bars, beer halls, and nightclubs' (93), have seen an increase in bankruptcies compared to the previous year. 'Chinese restaurants and other East Asian restaurants' saw a significant increase of 49 cases (45.0%) compared to the previous year, with a total of 158 cases. 'It is expected that the high prices will continue in the short term, but large companies are taking measures to reduce costs or pass them on to consumers, and some are also converting their existing stores to meet local needs and differentiate themselves. However, small businesses are struggling to maintain profitability due to rising costs and labor shortages, and are hesitant to raise prices due to consumer sentiment. As a result, it is expected that the number of bankruptcies and closures will remain at a high level, particularly among small and medium-sized businesses.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9](https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/2f25161272139ddab36c4505b12430e484960a57)\n\n**Record number of Japan ramen eateries went bankrupt in 2024**\nA record number of ramen noodle eatery operators in Japan went bankrupt in 2024, with 72 businesses going insolvent, up from 53 in 2023. The increase is attributed to rising ingredient and utility costs, as well as personnel expenses due to labor shortages. Despite the challenges, the average price of a bowl of ramen remains under 700 yen, but businesses are facing pressure to raise prices to around 1,000 yen to stay afloat. Takatoyo Sato, manager of Menkoi Dokoro Kiraku, said he had to raise prices in May 2024 to avoid losses, but noted that the decision was not well-received by all his regulars. Some consumers, like Munayoshi Suzuki, believe that diners have been 'spoiled' by low prices and that ramen is a 'non-necessity' that can be priced higher. However, Sato and Teikoku Databank predict that bankruptcies could continue in 2025, particularly among small and medium-sized businesses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 09:00 PM\nSource:[japantoday.com](https://japantoday.com/category/business/record-number-of-japan-ramen-eateries-went-bankrupt-in-2024)\n\n**Cocktail Bar Poppy Goes Bankrupt**\nThe cocktail bar Poppy, opened by chef Kari Inner\u00e5 in 2023, has gone bankrupt.

The owner's company, Poodle AS, has filed for bankruptcy. 'The employees are informed,' said Trude Gran Johansen, managing director of Poodle AS, to E24. 'The reason for the bankruptcy is a high cost level and small margins.' Inner\u00e5 expressed satisfaction with the bar's performance, saying, 'We're very happy, actually. We've had some fantastic months with a great concept. We're taking many good memories with us, we've had great evenings, we've delivered a great product, and we've had many satisfied customers.' However, she acknowledged that 2024 was a difficult year due to high inflation, high interest rates, and a 20% decline in the bar industry. 'It's super sad, but 2024 was a very different year than planned,' Inner\u00e5 said.
