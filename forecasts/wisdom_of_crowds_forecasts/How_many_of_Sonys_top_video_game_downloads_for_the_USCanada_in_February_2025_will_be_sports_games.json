Historically, sports games tend to occupy significant positions in download rankings, but not overwhelmingly so. Based on trends from previous similar situations, I hypothesize that the distribution of sports games in the top downloads follows a regular pattern. Typically, 0-2 sports games appear less frequently given the consistent attraction to major annual sports releases. The option '3-4' is commonly observed as a moderate reflection of variety in top charts. The individual counts '5', '6', and '7 or more' are rarer and usually align with exceptional years for sports game releases or marketing efforts.
