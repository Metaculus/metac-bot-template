    "question": "Will ChatGPT be able to order you a Starbucks delivery in Q1 2025?",
    "description": "In a January 2025 [blog post](https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections), OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, \"We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents 'join the workforce' and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes.\"",
    "fine_print": "ChatGPT should be able to successfully submit a Starbucks delivery order to a semi-arbitrary address in North America after a user has provided the order information. We define \u201csemi-arbitrary\u201d as substantially similar to anywhere that Starbucks (through its current partner DoorDash) is able to deliver normally when an order is placed through the Starbucks app or website. The LLM must generally be able to order any item available for delivery on the menu. Being limited to only ordering the user's most recent order or a subset of items is not sufficient. A user must be able to request the order solely through the main chat input field on the main chat interface. If additional plugins, API or other tools are required, it will not count.",

In recent years, we have witnessed a technological boom: tools like ChatGPT have conquered millions of users in a short time, demonstrating how AI can enter our daily lives. However, this technology also brings important challenges, especially when it comes to security and environmental impact. One of the most discussed problems is the energy consumption. AI does not work in a vacuum: behind every command, every generated response, there are enormous data centers that work non-stop and require an increasingly large amount of electricity. In the last ten years, the number of these centers has doubled, and if the trend continues, they will soon consume as much as entire nations. Therefore, companies are looking for solutions to make these systems more efficient and less energy-intensive. Some are focusing on technologies that optimize consumption, while others are looking at alternative energy sources. There are even those who are investing in nuclear energy to power data centers in a more stable and clean way. It may seem like science fiction, but the future could go in this direction. In addition to the energy issue, there is the theme of security. As AI becomes more powerful, the risks of cyber attacks and improper use of data also increase. Protecting sensitive information will be a priority for governments, companies, and users, who will have to find the right balance between innovation and data protection. As said by an expert, 'The future of AI is not just about technology, but also about responsibility and sustainability.'\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 08, 2025 11:09 AM\nSource:[Tecnoandroid](https://www.tecnoandroid.it/2025/02/08/il-2025-e-lia-svolta-tecnologica-o-sfida-insormontabile-1520628/)\n\n**You might be using ChatGPT wrong**\nChatGPT can be used beyond simple prompts to enhance creativity, create content in bulk, and even plan a vacation.

The apps, part of a campaign called SparkCat, target both Android and iPhone users through official and unofficial channels. Over 242,000 times, these malicious apps were downloaded from Google Play by Android users. Although the exact number of iPhone users affected is unknown, the fact that these apps made it to the App Store is notable, as no image-stealing apps have been found before. The malicious apps use an additional component, a machine learning-based OCR tool from Google's ML Kit, to read text from images and send them to cybercriminals responsible for the malware. The apps search for cryptocurrency wallet recovery phrases and can also identify other important information in images, such as messages or passwords captured in screenshots. Some of the affected apps include food delivery app ComeCome, chatbot app ChatAi, and messaging apps WeTink and AnyGPT, which are still available on Google Play and the App Store. According to the report, the malware has been active since March 2024, and it was difficult to identify the affected apps as they did not necessarily behave suspiciously and used the intended functionality to run the malware without additional permissions. The campaign primarily targets Android and iPhone users in Europe and Asia. If you have any of the mentioned apps on your phone, make sure to delete them, and to keep your device safe from such malware, avoid saving screenshots containing sensitive information in your phone's gallery.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 07, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[nafeza2world.com](https://www.nafeza2world.com/Tknwlwjya/2080488)\n\n**ChatGPT Search Engine Now Available to All Users Without Registration**\nOpenAI has made its AI search engine in ChatGPT available to all users without registration. Search in ChatGPT is now available to everyone on chatgpt.com, according to the company. ChatGPT has begun competing with search engines like Google or Bing, reports say. The company may also attract users of the AI service Perplexity, which presents itself as a search engine for researchers. The search option was introduced in ChatGPT in the fall of 2024. Now, after a query, the neural network can provide links to online resources. In December, search became free for all registered users. In February 2025, ChatGPT introduced the deep research function.

According to Kaspersky, this is the 'first known case' of an app infected with malware that uses OCR technology to extract text from images in the App Store. The malware, which was discovered at the end of 2024, works by requesting access to the user's photo gallery when they try to use the chat support within the infected app. Once granted permission, it uses Google's OCR technology to decipher the text found in the photos, looking for things like screenshots of passwords, encrypted wallets, or recovery phrases. The software then sends all the images it finds to hackers, who can use the information to access wallets and steal cryptocurrencies. Kaspersky says it cannot 'confirm with certainty that the infection was the result of a supply chain attack or a deliberate action by the developers.' Two chat AI apps, WeTink and AnyGPT, and a food delivery app, ComeCome, have been identified as part of the campaign and are still available for download on the App Store. It is not clear when these apps will be removed from the App Store.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[html.it](https://www.html.it/magazine/app-store-trovate-app-con-malware-che-legge-gli-screenshot/)\n\n**Poor Delivery Experiences Threaten Restaurant Reputations, Chatmeter Report Finds**\nAccording to a Chatmeter report, 36% of Americans plan to order food delivery for the Big Game on February 9, with 37% planning to spend more than in 2024.

Language models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude can answer questions, research online, summarize information, and even create complex texts - all for free. They can also assist in everyday tasks: how to fix a broken bike chain, what ingredients to use in a cheesecake, or how to prepare 'Bleigie\u00dfen' without lead for New Year's Eve. Chatbots provide answers and help willingly. The leading AI models from various providers have long moved beyond text: they can recognize images (simply upload a photo), understand spoken language, and respond with a natural-sounding voice. During the pre-Christmas period, people (especially children) could talk to Santa Claus for free at ChatGPT. The trend towards 'multimodality' - where a chatbot not only understands and outputs text, but also images, videos, and audio - makes AI tools more versatile than ever. In the new year 2025, experts expect another quantum leap: the increasing competition among providers like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and others will force the operators to offer new features under pressure and become better. AI systems will no longer only react passively, but will also actively act on request. Instead of just providing information, they will complete tasks independently. From booking movie tickets to managing tables - the new agents could drastically simplify everyday life. They will be able to take over tedious everyday tasks. Such AI agents go beyond mere interaction and can complete tasks independently. A typical scenario: the agent searches for the right flight (on request the cheapest, the shortest, only at the favorite airline), books it and informs about the details - all without human intervention. This is not a distant vision, but a feature that will enter everyday applications in 2025. However, the possibilities also raise questions: what data will these assistants collect (more than they do now), and how autonomously can they make decisions? Trust will play a central role, as agents learn their users better with each interaction - they must, otherwise they cannot make sensible decisions. While many basic functions will continue to be offered free of charge or at a low cost, this will not apply to the more powerful options. Providers like OpenAI or Google are increasingly relying on premium models that offer specialized functions and higher capacities - often at a high price. Those who want to use the full range of AI power, for example for analyzing complex data or for advanced automations in business, will not be able to get these services for free. The growing demand for increasingly powerful AI is likely to shift the price structures, making AI a worthwhile investment for both private and professional users.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 30, 2024 05:21 AM\nSource:[Westdeutscher Rundfunk](https://www1.wdr.de/nachrichten/ki-chatbots-agenten-100.html)\n\n**ChatGPT's Future: What to Expect in 2025**\nChatGPT is expected to receive several updates in 2025, including improved reasoning, a more extensive memory function, and deeper integration with devices and other tools. According to recent updates and leaks, the AI may gain the ability to store and reference past conversations, allowing it to adapt to individual users' preferences and behaviors. Additionally, ChatGPT may gain access to device data, enabling users to control their devices with voice commands. The AI may also become more fluent and natural in its conversations, allowing users to interact with it in real-time.

He asked ChatGPT to suggest a personalized gift for his cousin Johnny and deliver it on time, but the friendly chatbot couldn't assist, citing its inability to make purchases or arrange delivery directly. However, new AI products and capabilities have emerged since ChatGPT's launch, promising to simplify everyday tasks. While buying gifts remains beyond their capabilities, except for a few chatbots on websites or apps, experts predict a shift in 2025. AI agents, which can act on behalf of users in the real world, are expected to gain popularity. AI agents can do more than just suggest where to buy a Christmas costume; they can purchase it for the user and deliver it to their doorstep. A team of AI agents can perform tasks in sequence. For example, one can give the task: 'I'm preparing a Christmas dinner. Find my closest friends on Facebook, send them an invitation, and make sure one of them is a chef and brings a turkey.' Agents can accomplish this without user intervention. Limited versions of AI agents already exist, with 51% of those surveyed using them in practice, according to a report by Langchain. Venture capital firms invested $1.8 billion in AI agent projects in 2024, and Deloitte's research predicts that 25% of companies using generative AI will launch AI agents in 2025. However, two main issues remain: trust and contextual understanding. Will users be willing to trust AI agents with their financial information? And can AI agents understand their personal preferences well enough to choose the perfect gift? More is needed than just technology.
