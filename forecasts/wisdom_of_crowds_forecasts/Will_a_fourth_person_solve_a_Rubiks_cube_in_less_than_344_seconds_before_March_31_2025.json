        "description": "*This question is part of the* [*Bridgewater Forecasting Contest*](https://www.metaculus.com/bridgewater/)*. To be eligible to win prizes in the competition you must register for the tournament. The last day to register is March 24, 2025. Sign up or check your registration status* [*here*](https://www.metaculus.com/bridgewater/)*.*\n\n***\n\nThe Rubik's Cube was invented in 1974, released in 1980, and had its first world 'speedcubing' championship [just 8 years later](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing#History). The winner achieved a world record of 22.95 seconds. Since then, [17 more people](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/history-of-the-world-record-evolution/) have held this record, lowering the time to below 4 seconds. Speedcubers use memorized algorithms to solve the Rubik's Cube and top performances rely on choosing the fastest option and executing it flawlessly.\n\nAs of January 17, 2025, three performances are separated by the rest. While 20 people [have achieved](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/rankings/333/single) a time below 4s, only 3 have achieved one below 3.44s:\n\n* Max Park in 2023 (3.13s)\n* Ruihang Xu (\u8bb8\u745e\u822a) in 2024 (3.24s)\n* Yiheng Wang (\u738b\u827a\u8861) in 2024 (3.27s)",

The challenge, which appears simple at first glance, becomes more difficult due to the time constraint of 8 seconds. To solve it successfully, one must apply the PEMDAS technique, which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction. Following this principle, the correct solution is: 32 - 4 \u00f7 2 + 1 - 6 \u00f7 3 = 29. Those who can arrive at this number in 8 seconds can say they have a great math ability.

Hungarian designer Erno Rubik created the first prototype in 1974, which he later patented as the 'magic cube'. The cube's mechanism allows for rotating blocks to achieve a single color on each face. Initially, Rubik took a month to solve his invention, but the record has since been broken with a time of 3.13 seconds. The cube has been to the stratosphere and the deepest ocean, and has been used in extreme expeditions to explore creativity and learning. With 43 trillion possible variations in each cube, it's no wonder that 450 million have been sold worldwide. The book 'El Cubo de Rubik's' tells the story of the cube's history, including its appearance in popular culture, such as in 'The Simpsons' and 'The Big Bang Theory'. It also includes simple algorithms to solve the cube, as well as tricks to speed up the process. Even celebrities like Justin Bieber and Will Smith have attempted to solve the cube, with times of 90 seconds and under 60 seconds, respectively. On the other hand, David Hasselhoff has admitted to never being able to solve it. As Rubik himself writes in the book's prologue, the cube has been 'practically everywhere', from remote villages to elegant offices.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 08:23 AM\nSource:[xeu.mx](https://xeu.mx/tecnociencia/1359252/los-50-anos-del-cubo-de-rubik-obra-de-diseno-convertida-en-juguete-matematico-e-icono-pop)\n\n**The Cultural Phenomenon of Rubik's Cube: From Teaching Tool to Speedcubing Record**\nErn\u00f6 Rubik's 3D puzzle, the Rubik's Cube, was invented as a teaching tool for his students and patented on January 30, 1975.

The current world record holder, Max Park from the US, can solve the cube in just 3.13 seconds. In contrast, the cube's inventor, Ern\u0151 Rubik, took around a month to solve it. With over 412,000 participants in speedcubing competitions worldwide, the activity has gained popularity, with global sales of Rubik's Cube products reaching $86.6 million in 2023, a 13.5% increase from 2022. Researchers now praise speedcubing not only as a popular hobby but also as an activity that can have benefits for well-being. According to Polina Beloborodova, associate researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 'Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness.' Beloborodova explains that speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competition, a sense of efficacy, and mastery. Julia Christensen, researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics, adds that solving the cube can also evoke happiness by triggering aesthetic emotions such as wonder, beauty, and being moved. 'When a pattern is correct, when a movement is particularly astonishing, these aesthetic emotions can provide transformative experiences,' Christensen says.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2025 01:52 AM\nSource:[noticias24hrs.com.ve](https://www.noticias24hrs.com.ve/speedcubing-el-antiguo-hobby-que-segun-cientificos-puede-hacerte-mas-feliz/)\n\n**Ningbo Student Breaks Chinese Record for Solving Rubik's Cube**\n12-year-old Chen Zhen from Ningbo, China broke the Chinese record for solving a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube with a single hand, achieving an average time of 8.42 seconds at the 2025 WCA West Anshan New Year's Cube Competition.
