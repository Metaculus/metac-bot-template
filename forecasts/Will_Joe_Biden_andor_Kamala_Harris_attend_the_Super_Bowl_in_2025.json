NFL stars are looking forward to playing in front of him. Trump will be the first sitting US president to attend a Super Bowl finale. Kansas City Chiefs' Travis Kelce said, 'I think it's a great honor, regardless of who the president is.' Kelce's girlfriend, Taylor Swift, who has previously criticized Trump and supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, will also be attending the game. The Chiefs are seeking their third consecutive NFL title and will face the Philadelphia Eagles in the final. Eagles are seeking revenge after losing to the Chiefs in the 2023 finale. When asked about the winner of the final, Trump said, 'I won't say, but there's a certain quarterback who looks like a pretty good winner.' Chiefs' quarterback Patrick Mahomes had not seen the clip of Trump's comment and said, 'It's always cool to play in front of a sitting president, someone who holds the highest position in the country.'\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: February 06, 2025 07:31 AM\nSource:[Bergens Tidende (BT)](https://www.bt.no/i/GyX2X9)\n\n**Eagles fan Jill Biden to attend Super Bowl LIX: report**\nJill Biden, a Philadelphia Eagles fan and former first lady, will reportedly attend Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans with her grandson. Former President Joe Biden will not be in attendance. Jill Biden and her grandson were also present at the 2023 Super Bowl, where the Eagles played the Kansas City Chiefs. The two teams will face off again this weekend, with the Chiefs seeking to win three consecutive Super Bowls, a feat no NFL team has achieved.

The Kansas City Chiefs, led by quarterback Patrick Mahomes, will attempt to win their first Super Bowl three-peat. US President Donald Trump is expected to attend the Super Bowl for the first time as an incumbent president. The game will be held on February 10 at the Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, where the Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles for the second time in two years. Mahomes is aiming for his fourth Super Bowl MVP award, which would put him one step closer to Tom Brady's record of five MVP awards. The NFL has decided to remove the 'End Racism' message from the end zone of the Super Bowl stadium, which has been displayed since 2021, and replace it with 'Choose Love' and 'It Takes All of Us.' The Secret Service has announced that Trump will attend the Super Bowl and has increased security measures in the New Orleans area. The possibility of a meeting between Trump and pop star Taylor Swift is also being discussed, as Swift is expected to attend the game to support her boyfriend Travis Kelce, who plays for the Chiefs. Swift publicly endorsed Trump's opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 US presidential election. The halftime show, which features a performance by Kendrick Lamar, a five-time Grammy Award winner, is one of the highlights of the Super Bowl. Despite the various attractions, ticket prices have fallen sharply, with some seats dropping by up to 60% on resale sites.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 10:41 PM\nSource:[\uad6d\ubbfc\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.kmib.co.kr/article/view.asp?arcid=1738742368)\n\n**Travis Kelce Reacts to Trump's Decision to Attend Super Bowl 2025**\nKansas City Chiefs player Travis Kelce thinks it's a 'big honor' that President Donald Trump will attend Super Bowl 2025.

It's a great honor.' However, he stopped short of endorsing the president, stating, 'You know, no matter who the president is.' This response was surprising given Trump's contentious relationship with Kelce's girlfriend, Taylor Swift, who endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. Kelce has previously faced criticism for not sharing Swift's political convictions. Meanwhile, Patrick Mahomes, Kelce's teammate, diplomatically commented on Trump's attendance, saying, 'It's always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president.'

He added, 'I don't care who the president is, I'm excited because it's the most important game of my life, and having the president there, it's the best country in the world, and that's great.' This comes after Trump made comments about Kelce's girlfriend, Taylor Swift, for supporting Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential elections. Trump said, 'I'm not a fan of Taylor Swift' and 'she's a very liberal person who always supports a Democrat.' He also posted on Truth Social, 'I hate Taylor Swift.' Swift responded by announcing her support for Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 elections, stating, 'I will vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. I will vote for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes that I believe need a warrior to defend them.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2025 08:19 PM\nSource:[El Comercio Per\u00fa](https://elcomercio.pe/mag/fama/celebs/que-dijo-travis-kelce-sobre-la-presencia-de-donald-trump-en-el-super-bowl-2025-taylor-swift-usa-nnda-nnni-noticia/)\n\n**Travis Kelce: 'It's a great honor' that President Trump will attend...**\nTravis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, expressed his excitement and honor that President Trump will attend the Super Bowl.

Carville previously wrote that Harris would win the election, but after her loss, he changed his tune, stating that the Democrats 'ran a presidential election with a candidate who couldn't even complete a sentence.' He also blamed Joe Biden for the party's defeat, saying that he 'stands over this disaster like a colossus.' Carville's comments echo those of Nancy Pelosi, who previously blamed Biden for dropping out of the race 'too late,' which led to Harris taking the nomination without a primary. 'Had the president gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,' Pelosi stated. 'Because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. Had it been much earlier, it would have been different.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 07:22 PM\nSource:[One America News Network](https://www.oann.com/newsroom/dem-strategist-democrats-ran-7th-string-quarterback-kamala-harris-in-a-super-bowl-election/)\n\n**Carville Criticizes Kamala for Loss**\nLong-time Democrat strategist James Carville criticized former Vice President Kamala Harris after her loss to President Donald Trump in the November presidential race.

He emphasized the need for honesty about problems and showcased the 'staggering talent' in the Democratic Party, stating 'If we would have excited people, we would have had people from the middle of the country, would have had people from the coasts, we would have been diverse...and then, when you do that, that's how people get involved in politics.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 08:02 PM\nSource:[Townhall](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/jeremyfrankel/2025/02/02/carville-criticizes-kamala-for-loss-n2651524)\n\n**The Super Bowl logo conspiracy theory is roaring back to life with the 2025 Chiefs vs. Eagles matchup. Here's why**\nThe Super Bowl LIX logo, revealed in 2024, has sparked a conspiracy theory among some fans that the National Football League (NFL) selects Super Bowl teams in advance to increase profits or for political reasons. The logo features red and green colors, matching those of the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles, the teams playing in Super Bowl 59. This is not the first time fans have made this claim, as a similar theory emerged ahead of last year's AFC and NFC championship games, but lost steam after the teams broke the trend. According to some right-wing conspiracy theorists, the NFL's alleged manipulation of the game is linked to Taylor Swift's relationship with Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, and her supposed role as a 'liberal plant' at Chiefs games to help President Joe Biden win the last election, as stated by @NFL_Memes on X. However, these claims are unconfirmed and have not been proven.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 09:14 PM\nSource:[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/91267654/super-bowl-logo-2025-game-colors-chiefs-eagles-conspiracy-theory)\n\n**'Deeply sad' Kamala betrayed by Biden is hit by news about her future**\nKamala Harris's post-election behavior has been a departure from her previous image as a 'joyful' and 'generous' politician. She has been described as 'mean-spirited' and 'brooding', with a 'deep sadness' over her loss in the 2024 presidential election. Harris has also been criticized for breaching protocol by not inviting Vice President-elect JD Vance and his wife to the vice president's official residence, and for her icy demeanor at the funeral of President Jimmy Carter. Her relationships with her own team and the Bidens have also become increasingly strained. According to sources, Harris has complained to close allies that she's disappointed that Biden has claimed in interviews that he could have won the 2024 election if he hadn't dropped out of the race. 'The postelection rapport among the Bidens and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, in private settings has at times been frosty,' sources told the Wall Street Journal on January 3. Despite this, Harris is reportedly planning to double down on her new image, and is expected to emerge as a presidential candidate in 2028 or make a bid for governor of California in 2026. However, her ability to portray herself as a faithful public servant will be tested on Monday, as she attends Trump's swearing-in ceremony on the steps of the US Capitol. 'She's probably going to be gritting her teeth as she does it, it's really going to be difficult on Inauguration Day,' said Andersen Brower, the author of 'First In Line, Presidents Vice Presidents, and the Pursuit of Power.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 02:43 PM\nSource:[Daily Mail Online](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14294259/Kamala-harris-betrayed-Biden-future.html)\n\n**US President Biden to deliver farewell address next week**\nOutgoing US President Joe Biden will deliver his farewell address on Wednesday at 8pm (ET) from the Oval Office.

The certification process was carried out with strict security measures and a snowstorm, but without any disruptions. Vice President Kamala Harris, presiding over the proceedings, read out the count, including her own defeat. Trump is set to take office in two weeks with a renewed sense of authority, but the certification process comes with a caveat, as it marks a return to a peaceful transfer of power tradition. New procedural rules have been introduced following the events of four years ago, requiring a fifth of lawmakers to raise any objections to election results, rather than just one in each chamber. With security as tight as that of the Super Bowl or the Olympics, the Capitol was at its highest level of security, with no tourists allowed. However, no objections were raised. Republicans, who had previously planned to challenge Trump's electoral defeat, have accepted his victory this time. Democrats, who have previously raised symbolic objections, did not intend to do so. In one of his final acts, President Biden awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Democratic Congressman Bennie Thompson and former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who had served as president and vice president of the Congressional commission that investigated the January 6, 2021, events, as quoted by Biden, 'It is a testament to their commitment to democracy and the rule of law.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 03:08 PM\nSource:[elcentronews.net](https://elcentronews.net/el-congreso-certifica-la-victoria-electoral-de-donald-trump/)\n\n**Kansas City Cozy: Healthy Fare, War Threats & Veep Befouls Pledge**\nThe article highlights various news stories from Kansas City, including the opening of East Side Organic Fare, a new shop on The Paseo that offers natural flavors; a missing person case near a Kansas City bridge; and the Kansas City Chiefs' chances of achieving a Super Bowl three-peat.
