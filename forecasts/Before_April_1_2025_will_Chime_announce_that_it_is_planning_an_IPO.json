Lawsuit - VG**\nThe Gross Law Firm is reminding shareholders of Venture Global, Inc. (NYSE: VG) of a lead plaintiff deadline of April 18, 2025, in a lawsuit related to the company's initial public offering (IPO) on January 27, 2025. According to the complaint, TotalEnergies, a target customer of Venture, rejected opportunities to become a long-term customer due to lack of trust, citing statements made by the company's CEO. Venture is currently facing legal challenges from existing large clients, such as BP and Shell, due to delays in supply contracts. The Gross Law Firm is seeking recovery on behalf of investors who incurred losses when false and/or misleading statements or the omission of material information by Venture led to artificial inflation of the company's stock. Shareholders who purchased shares of VG during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment.

However, the reports are still unofficial, and negotiations are ongoing regarding the details. A representative of the company declined to comment on the matter. The company, backed by Sequoia Capital, may significantly boost the primary public offering market in the technology sector, which has been stagnant since last year's record volumes. Other fintech companies, such as Chime Financial Inc. and Zilch Technology Ltd., are also considering potential initial public offerings this year. Klarna's valuation has fluctuated significantly, reaching a record $45.6 billion in 2021, before plummeting to $6.7 billion in the following year. In the previous year, analysts estimated its value at around $14.6 billion, based on the valuation of Chrysalis Investments Ltd.'s stake.

According to sources, Klarna plans to price its IPO in early April and aims to be valued at over $15 billion on the New York Stock Exchange. The company has been in talks with around 15 banks, led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan, to facilitate its listing. Klarna's IPO will be a boost to the tech industry, which has seen a decline in IPOs since 2021. Other fintech companies, including Chime Financial Inc and Zilch Technology Ltd, are also considering going public this year. Klarna's valuation has fluctuated significantly in recent years, reaching a high of $45.6 billion in 2021 but dropping to $6.7 billion in the following year. According to an estimate by Chrysalis Investments Ltd, Klarna's implied valuation is around $14.6 billion. Klarna's CEO, Sebastian Siemiatkowski, has stated that the company is exploring entry into the cryptocurrency market. 'We will embrace cryptocurrencies,' he said on X in February. 'Klarna is exploring the possibility of entering the cryptocurrency market,' Siemiatkowski added.

This comes as the US IPO market shows signs of recovery. Founded in 2015 by Jason Citron, Discord offers voice, video, and text chat features to its 2 billion monthly active users worldwide. The company had considered going public in 2021 but put its plans on hold due to market uncertainty. However, with interest rates decreasing and the US government introducing more favorable policies for the tech industry, Discord is now re-examining its IPO plans. According to PitchBook data, Discord was valued at around $150 billion in 2021. The company's IPO plans are still uncertain, but it is not alone in re-examining its public listing. Other high-value startups, including Stripe, Chime, and Databricks, have also delayed their IPO plans due to market conditions and are now considering going public. In contrast, Skype, the pioneer of online calls, will cease service on May 5. Microsoft, which acquired Skype in 2011, will focus on its Teams platform instead. Discord, on the other hand, has taken a conservative approach to its advertising business, choosing to generate revenue through paid membership features rather than relying on advertising like its competitors Meta, X, and Reddit.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 06, 2025 02:42 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5599/8589479)\n\n**AI firm Genesys delays 2025 IPO due to stock market volatility- The Information By Investing.com**\nGenesys, a developer of artificial intelligence-driven call center software, has delayed its planned initial public offering (IPO) due to increased stock market volatility.

The company plans to distribute the entire NT$1.11 in cash dividends and has also approved a cash reduction plan, returning NT$1.8 per share, totaling NT$2.91 per share. Chimei Innolux's CFO, Hung Chiu-Chin, stated, 'To adjust the capital structure and improve the return on equity, we plan to conduct a cash reduction, returning NT$1.8 per share.' The company expects to reduce its capital by approximately NT$34.69 billion, eliminating 34,694,453 shares, and reducing the capital ratio to 18%. The company's capital will decrease from approximately NT$192.7 billion to NT$158 billion. After the shareholders' meeting approves and reports to the relevant authorities, the board of directors will be authorized to determine the exchange operation plan, reduction date, and stock exchange date. Chimei Innolux explained that due to its expansion into high-value-added businesses such as medicine, the company's operating profit margin has continued to rise, reaching 16.5% in 2024, exceeding 16% for the second consecutive year and setting a new record high. Although the company's display revenue and profit have increased compared to 2023, the overseas subsidiary's storage depreciation loss and customer inventory adjustments have affected the company's final profit performance. In 2024, the company's fourth-quarter combined revenue reached NT$54.1 billion, a new high for the past two years, with operating profit of NT$8.84 billion and net profit of NT$1.91 billion, resulting in an EPS of NT$0.1. In 2024, the company's combined revenue was NT$201.7 billion, with operating profit of NT$331.81 billion, operating net profit of NT$45.2 billion, and net profit of NT$28.14 billion, resulting in an EPS of NT$1.11. The company also announced its combined revenue for February, which was NT$15.534 billion, a year-on-year increase of 11.1%, and a month-on-month decrease of 6%. The company's combined revenue for the first two months was NT$32.072 billion, a year-on-year increase of 6%, with growth in the information, medical, and smart scheme businesses compared to the same period last year. The company will hold a corporate briefing on June 6 to explain its operating performance and outlook for the year.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: March 05, 2025 01:06 PM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/afe/202503050363.aspx)\n\n**MTS Prepares to List AdTech and '\u042e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442' Assets on Stock Exchange**\nMTS is preparing to list two of its assets, AdTech and '\u042e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0442', on the stock exchange in 2025.

Why There's Hope For More IPOs In 2025.**\nThe IPO market is expected to improve in 2025, with some big-name startups preparing to go public. Cloud-computing provider CoreWeave is considering filing for an IPO at a valuation of over $35 billion, while fintech company Chime has filed confidentially for an IPO. Despite the optimism, the market has been slow to start the year, with only a few notable IPOs, including SailPoint, which raised $1.4 billion. The slowdown in the IPO market has created a 'large backlog' of unicorn startups with private market valuations of over $1 billion, with over 600 active venture-backed U.S. startups expected to pursue an IPO. However, a sudden rush to go public is unlikely, with only the 'tippy-top companies' expected to test the IPO market in the next year. The strength of the stock market will be the most important factor for new IPO stocks, with analysts predicting that a strong market will lead to increased IPO activity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[Investor's Business Daily](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ipo-market-slump-unicorns-new-ipo-stocks-2025/)\n\n**With Strong 2024 Growth, Chime Appears On Track For An IPO**\nChime, the largest digital bank in America, has reported strong growth in 2024, with revenue increasing by 30% to $1.7 billion and a narrowing loss of less than $50 million. The company has also reached eight million active customers, up from seven million in the first half of 2024. Chime's positive trends suggest it is on track to go public, with a planned IPO in the first half of this year. The company has been driven by heavy spending on advertising and cross-selling its customers on additional products, and has made significant strides in the fintech industry, including being named to Forbes' Fintech 50 list for the seventh consecutive year. Industry insiders expect Chime to be valued at $10 billion or more when it makes its public debut.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 28, 2025 11:32 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2025/02/28/with-strong-2024-growth-chime-appears-on-track-for-an-ipo/)\n\n**Analysts Urge Caution With IPO Investors \u2018Scrutinizing Deals Carefully\u2019**\nAnalysts are warning investors to be cautious when it comes to initial public offerings (IPOs). Despite improved market sentiment, investors are scrutinizing deals carefully and are not willing to pay overvalued companies. This was evident in the recent IPO of Venture Global, which was downgraded by 45% due to investor pushback. Analysts attribute this to the company's high valuation and legal issues. Meanwhile, there are hopes for a resurgence in IPOs this year, with companies such as Klarna, CoreWeave, and Chime planning to go public. However, investors are advised to be cautious and not get caught up in the hype. As IPOX CEO Josef Schuster said, 'Even with the improved market sentiment we\u2019ve seen, investors are going to continue scrutinizing deals carefully.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2025 11:51 PM\nSource:[biztoc.com](https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2025/analysts-urge-caution-with-ipo-investors-scrutinizing-deals-carefully/?ref=biztoc.com)\n\n**3 highly anticipated IPOs that investors should wait for in 2025**\nThe US stock market's bull run is expected to bring growth to select IPO stocks in 2025, making it a good time for US investors to invest. Three highly anticipated IPOs to watch out for are Chime, a fintech company that has raised $750 million in funding and is planning a public debut in 2025, Stripe, another fintech company that could see good growth when it goes public, and Databricks, a data analytics software company that is comparable to Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform and is planning to launch its IPO this year. According to the article, 'the report would be quite in favor of US investors' if Chime's year-on-year growth is assessed. However, it's worth noting that there are risks involved with IPO investments, as seen in 2023 and 2024's first half.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 10:21 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/3-highly-anticipated-ipos-that-investors-should-wait-for-in-2025/articleshow/117519406.cms)\n\n**6 IPOs to Watch in 2025**\nPitchBook analysts predict that 20 unicorns could go public in 2025, with several high-profile financial technology stocks and artificial intelligence plays leading the charge. Venture Global, a natural gas exporter, is set to list this week, seeking a valuation of up to $65 billion. Other notable IPOs to watch in 2025 include Chime, Klarna, Medline Industries, SailPoint Technologies, Cerebras Systems, and CoreWeave. Analysts credit the rosy outlook for IPOs in 2025 to a combination of factors, including a bull market, economic growth, and optimism about interest rate cuts. 'If Chime goes out early and does well, it's a really good bellwether,' says Duncan Davidson, a general partner and cofounder of Bullpen Capital. 'It looks like the kind of company that would attract a lot of interest, in terms of being kind of a tech IPO, but could also stand to benefit from sustained consumer spending,' says Angelo Bochanis, an IPO data and index associate at Renaissance Capital. The IPO market is expected to be broadly distributed across sectors, with ongoing momentum from the life science and pharma industries, and Big Tech not going anywhere. 'There's a lot of excitement,' says Mike Bellin, IPO Services Leader at PwC US. 'We'll see some activity in that space in 2025 but I think there's probably room to grow for many of those organizations' before they list, he adds.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 09:54 AM\nSource:[morningstar.co.uk](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/259597/6-ipos-to-watch-in-2025-ai-and-fintech-companies-among-the-names.aspx)\n\n**Will Trump 2.0 Reignite The Sluggish IPO Market?**\nThe IPO market is expected to rebound in 2025 with the new administration headed by President Trump, who has a history of taking companies public via SPAC mergers. Lise Buyer, an IPO advisor, believes that the broader deregulatory push will be a catalyst for a healthier market, particularly for sectors such as crypto and AI. Buyer notes that previous private market valuations were high, but growth has slowed, making it more acceptable for companies to accept a valuation haircut. Several prominent players have filed with the SEC or are rumored to be preparing to file, including Chime Financial, Klarna, and Venture Global. West Riggs, Managing Director at Truist Securities, believes that the relative outperformance of IPOs in 2024 has primed the market to be more receptive to new issues in 2025. However, Doug Ellenoff, a lawyer, is skeptical that wholesale changes will occur, and Lou Taubman notes that companies from China may face increased scrutiny due to escalating disputes over trade and investment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 04:13 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewbernstein/2025/01/15/will-trump-20-reignite-the-sluggish-ipo-market/)\n\n**Investment Bankers Banking on an IPO Turnaround in 2025 | PYMNTS.com**\nInvestment bankers are optimistic about a dealmaking uptick in equity capital markets this year, fueled by a promising stable of initial public offerings (IPOs) by high-profile companies.

Several other companies have also filed their documents before the end of 2024, including Venture Global, one of the largest liquefied natural gas suppliers in the US, which could exceed $3 billion in its initial public offering. In late December, Medline and Chime Financial, a fintech startup, filed their basic documents with US regulatory agencies, paving the way for a massive IPO expected for their shares, according to a report by Bloomberg on January 8, 2025. The value of Medline's IPO in the market is expected to reach around $5 billion, according to Reuters on November 22, 2024. At least 9 companies, including the mentioned ones, are planning to conduct an IPO in 2025, with a potential value of $1 billion or more per company, totaling around $18 billion, according to Bloomberg. The bankers expect an increase in IPO activity, unless President-elect Donald Trump's policies pose any obstacles, as the markets expect a modest decrease in interest rates, and private equity companies are seeking to break the deadlock and sell shares in companies they have invested in.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 11, 2025 05:00 AM\nSource:[roayahnews.com](https://roayahnews.com/%D8%A5%D9%86%D9%81%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B4-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84/)\n\n**The IPO Market Heats Up for 2025 With Red-Hot Deals on the Way**\nThe IPO market is expected to heat up in 2025 with several high-profile deals on the horizon.

Private equity companies are expected to turn to the equities markets to offload some of their high-profile holdings, with a number of firms already filing IPO paperwork. Bankers and analysts expect the first half of this year to bring a flurry of IPO announcements, fueled by a strong stock market and the hopes that the incoming administration will reduce taxes and roll back regulations. Eddie Molloy, global co-head of equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley, said, 'Successive improvement and more activity, that's the headline.' He also predicted that large private-equity backed IPOs will be the most important theme. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs' head of technology equity capital markets, Will Connolly, said, 'There's a massive population of big, scaled companies in tech that are IPO candidates, and there's a lot of demand to put money to work.' The FinTech IPO market is also expected to be active, with companies like Chime and Klarna preparing to go public.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2025 10:35 PM\nSource:[PYMNTS.com](https://www.pymnts.com/news/ipo/2025/wall-street-reportedly-prepping-private-equity-fueled-ipo-revival/)\n\n**Bankers gear up for 2025 IPO wave**\nInvestment bankers expect a significant rebound in US initial public offerings (IPOs) in 2025, driven by private equity firms seeking to monetize holdings amid buoyant equity markets and reduced regulatory pressures.
