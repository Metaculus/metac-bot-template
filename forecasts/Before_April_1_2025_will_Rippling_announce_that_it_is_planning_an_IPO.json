(NYSE: VG) of a lead plaintiff deadline of April 18, 2025, in a lawsuit related to the company's initial public offering (IPO) on January 27, 2025. According to the complaint, TotalEnergies, a target customer of Venture, rejected opportunities to become a long-term customer due to lack of trust, citing statements made by the company's CEO. Venture is currently facing legal challenges from existing large clients, such as BP and Shell, due to delays in supply contracts. The Gross Law Firm is seeking recovery on behalf of investors who incurred losses when false and/or misleading statements or the omission of material information by Venture led to artificial inflation of the company's stock. Shareholders who purchased shares of VG during the class period listed are encouraged to contact the firm regarding possible lead plaintiff appointment.

'We confirm the adoption of a strategic decision to prepare for a public offering of shares,' the representative said. 'Going public will allow us to increase the company's status in the eyes of partners, expand capital attraction options, and increase brand recognition. Corporate governance will also be improved during the preparation process.' The timing of the IPO will depend on the company's readiness and market conditions, while the size of the IPO has not been determined, said the representative of Secret Technologies. The company is currently in the process of obtaining a small technology company status, which will be completed soon, according to the representative. In preparation for the IPO, the organization plans to begin preparing financial reporting in accordance with IFRS standards, form a board of directors, and take other necessary steps. Secret Technologies is currently selecting consultants who will assist in preparing the placement and choosing the platform, added the representative. The company aims to attract funds, including for strategic initiatives, such as the development of new technological solutions and the implementation of organic growth opportunities, said one of the sources. Secret Technologies does not have a company valuation, and it is guided by 'Positive' from public sources, said the representative. According to the latest data in SPARK, the company's revenue grew by two times in 2023 to almost 1.1 billion rubles. Management expenses increased by more than two times to 113 million rubles, while net profit decreased by 26.2% to 66.8 million rubles.

Klarna's debut will provide a litmus test for whether valuations have rebounded further, and its pioneering presence in the BNPL space has positioned the startup as a global leader. According to Kim Waldron, founder and MD at fintech-focused firm Started PR, the anticipated influx of IPOs is a tribute to the sector's maturity and growing investor confidence in the industry's innovations. 'Klarna's listing will provide other firms waiting in the wings with a tangible insight into what their listing could look like, and how receptive investors will be to their debut,' Waldron said. 'It will pave the way for a listing resurgence throughout the industry if its debut goes well.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 24, 2025 04:26 PM\nSource:[FXEmpire.com](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/klarna-ipo-could-spark-an-avalanche-of-fintech-listings-in-2025-1499891)\n\n**Tata Capital to Consider Rights Issue Before IPO Launch**\nTata Capital, a non-banking finance company (NBFC) of the Tata Group, is planning to launch an initial public offering (IPO) this year to list on the stock exchange.

Meet venture's new guard. Conviction founder Sarah Guo and partner Mike Vernal have raised a $230 million second fund, twice the size of their first, and are focused on AI investments. Other notable departures include Alex Taussig and Nicole Quinn from Lightspeed, Matt Miller from Sequoia, and Sriram Krishnan and Michelle Volz from a16z. These departures are attributed to two concurrent issues facing the industry: evaporating financial incentives and bloated partnerships. Strong performers are restless due to compensation, and the lack of IPOs and acquisitions has limited cash returns, leaving some partners as the odd ones out.

According to Reuters, citing direct sources, the IPO could occur as early as April 20, during Easter week. The development comes after a British minister of finance, Rachel Reeves, is set to visit China on January 11 to discuss economic and financial cooperation with Vice Premier He Lifeng. This announcement follows the rejection of Shein's IPO by lawmakers due to concerns over risks related to China and alleged labor practices. 'The IPO could be a significant step for Shein, but it also raises concerns about the company's ties to China,' said a source. 'We are working closely with the British government to ensure that the IPO meets all regulatory requirements.' \nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 10, 2025 11:58 AM\nSource:[distribucionactualidad.com](https://www.distribucionactualidad.com/la-salida-de-shein-a-la-bolsa-de-londres-podria-llegar-en-semana-santa/)\n\n**Shein Plans London Stock Exchange Listing in First Half of 2025**\nChinese online fashion retailer 'Shein' is planning to list its shares on the London Stock Exchange in the first half of this year, pending regulatory approvals, according to sources familiar with the matter. One source said that the initial public offering (IPO) could be completed by April 20, and a visit by UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves to China to discuss economic and financial cooperation between the two countries may help secure the necessary approvals. Another source confirmed that Shein is working to list its shares in London in the first half of this year, but the final timeline is still unclear. Despite relocating its headquarters from China to Singapore in 2022, Shein still needs approval from the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission to list its shares.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 09, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0623\u0631\u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629](https://www.argaam.com/ar/article/articledetail/id/1781293)\n\n",
