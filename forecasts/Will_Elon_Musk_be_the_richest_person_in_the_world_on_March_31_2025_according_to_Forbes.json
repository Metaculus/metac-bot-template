Despite this, Musk remains the richest person in the world, with around $130 billion (R$ 750 billion) more than the second-placed Mark Zuckerberg. The decline in Musk's net worth is linked to the 6.3% drop in Tesla's stock price on Tuesday, closing at $328.50 (R$ 1,896.33), the lowest price since November 15. Analysts from Oppenheimer and Stifel warn that Musk's political activity may lead to a consumer backlash, which could negatively impact Tesla's sales. In February, Tesla's stock price fell by 18.8%, or over $76 (R$ 438.73) per share. However, the prices remain high compared to before Trump's victory. On November 4, 2024, two days before Trump's win, the stock price was listed at $242.84 (R$ 1,401.84).\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 02:33 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/elon-musk-fica-r-248-bilhoes-mais-pobre-em-fevereiro-mas-cotinua-como-mais-rico-do-mundo,cc7fffb6d16141a41cd9e73e1fd6a893wzepo98m.html)\n\n**Musk Loses Over $240 Billion in Fortune, but Remains World's Richest Person**\nBillionaire Elon Musk's fortune decreased by approximately US$ 42.8 billion (R$ 247.3 billion in direct conversion) during the first days of February, resulting in a reduction of his net worth to US$ 378.8 billion. Despite this decrease, Musk remains the richest person in the world, with a significant lead of US$ 130 billion over the second-placed CEO of Meta, Mark Zuckerberg. The main reason for the decrease in Musk's fortune was the devaluation of Tesla's stocks, which make up a large part of his wealth. Tesla's stock price decreased by 6.3% on Tuesday (11), with a value of US$ 328.50, the lowest price since November 15. As a result, any decline in Tesla's assets directly affects Musk's fortune. Additionally, Musk's political stance and alliance with US President Donald Trump may also impact the stock price, as experts from Investing.com suggest that his political activities may create uncertainty among investors.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 02:24 PM\nSource:[Canaltech](https://canaltech.com.br/mercado/musk-perde-mais-de-r-240-bilhoes-de-fortuna-mas-continua-o-mais-rico-do-mundo/)\n\n**Elon Musk Loses Over $240 Billion in February Due to Tesla's Stock Decline**\nElon Musk lost over $240 billion in February due to the decline in Tesla's stock value. Despite this, he remains the richest person in the world. The main reason for the decline in Musk's wealth was the devaluation of Tesla's shares, which fell 6.3% on Tuesday (11) to $328.50, the lowest price since November 15, 2024. In a month, the decline accumulated 18.55%. Tesla's numbers have been falling since the release of its corporate results for the 4th quarter of 2024, which showed a 6.3% decline in revenue and a 2.6% decrease in earnings per share. The demand for Tesla's electric models has also been declining, due to the growth of rivals such as BYD. In 2024, Tesla experienced its first annual decline in vehicle deliveries. As the billionaire owns a large portion of Tesla's shares, the devaluation affects his wealth. As a result, Musk's net worth decreased from $421.6 billion in late January to $378.8 billion.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 12, 2025 01:25 PM\nSource:[Olhar Digital - O futuro passa primeiro aqui](https://olhardigital.com.br/2025/02/12/pro/elon-musk-perdeu-mais-de-r-240-bilhoes-durante-governo-trump/)\n\n**Elon Musk Loses $242 Billion, but Remains World's Richest Man**\nBillionaire Elon Musk, owner of X (formerly Twitter), SpaceX, and Tesla, remains the richest man in the world, but lost tens of billions of dollars in February. According to Forbes, Musk's fortune decreased by $42 billion, equivalent to R$ 242.6 billion, in the first days of February. With this loss, Musk's net worth is now $378.8 billion (approximately R$ 2.1 trillion). At the end of January, his fortune was $421.6 billion (R$ 2.4 trillion). Despite losing over R$ 240 billion, Musk still holds the top spot in Forbes' ranking of the world's richest people. He has around $130 billion (R$ 751.1 billion) more than Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Musk's loss of wealth is largely due to the significant devaluation of Tesla's shares, which fell by over 6% on Tuesday (12/2), closing at $328.50, the lowest value since November last year. In just one month, Tesla's shares have declined by 18.5%. Tesla's net profit between October and December last year was $2.32 billion (approximately R$ 13.5 billion), while analysts had estimated a profit of $2.67 billion (R$ 15.6 billion) for the last quarter of the year.

The Democratic opposition considers Musk's actions to be illegal. Musk has also been criticized for his multiple government contracts and potential conflicts of interest.

Macron had hoped that Musk's presence would give the event a significant boost in reputation, but the two men's relationship has deteriorated in recent weeks. Macron has accused Musk of fueling a 'new international reactionary movement' after he entered politics in Germany and the UK, supporting far-right figures in both countries. Musk has never publicly confirmed his participation in the summit, but Macron's office had expected him to attend. The French president has been trying to woo Musk for years, hoping to attract investments in France, but Tesla has not invested significantly in the country. Macron and Musk have a complex relationship, with Macron viewing Musk as a highly innovative entrepreneur who has taken risks to develop electric cars. However, Musk is also seen as a difficult person to follow, with a non-linear expression. The two men have had a series of ups and downs, including a meeting at the Choose France summit in May 2023, where Musk announced that Tesla would make 'significant investments in France'. However, Tesla has not followed through on these plans, and Macron's office is now trying to woo Musk again.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 11, 2025 06:48 PM\nSource:[dagospia.com](https://www.dagospia.com/politica/musk-ettiere-elon-delude-macron-l-uomo-piu-ricco-mondo-disertato-summit-424306)\n\n**Bad news for Elon Musk as world's richest man's net worth falls to..., is closeness to Trump behind this?**\nElon Musk's net worth has fallen below USD 400 billion for the first time in two months, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. This decline is largely due to a 27% drop in Tesla's stock prices over the past 2-3 months. As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Musk has been devoting more attention to the new US government and is likely to advocate for a level playing field for electric cars and seek early regulatory approval for Starlink in India. Musk is also set to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 13, along with other CEOs, to discuss potential collaborations.
