This is a result of the electoral reform, which has been discussed for decades. The main principle of the electoral system in Germany remains unchanged: each voter receives two ballots, one for a specific candidate in a constituency and one for a party list. The second ballot, which is for the party list (Zweitstimme), has more weight and its importance has increased after the electoral reform in Germany. Party candidates are not nominated as a single list for the entire country, but rather as party lists from each of the 16 federal states. The number of deputies in the Bundestag has been reduced by 100, which is expected to save the state around 125 million euros per year. However, according to J\u00f6rg Siegmund, a political scientist, the question of saving money is secondary, and democracy is worth the cost. The reform has abolished the provision for 'overhang' mandates (\u00dcberhang- und Ausgleichmandate), which allowed parties to receive additional mandates if they won more seats in constituencies than their proportional share of votes. This change is expected to have consequences for some candidates, as not all winning candidates in constituencies will receive a seat in the Bundestag. 'This may lead to some constituencies being left without representation in the Bundestag, particularly in large cities,' warns Siegmund. The 5% threshold for parties to enter the Bundestag remains in place, but there is an exception for parties that win at least three seats in constituencies, which allows them to enter the Bundestag even if they do not meet the 5% threshold. The Constitutional Court blocked the attempt to abolish this exception, arguing that it would lead to many votes being left unrepresented in the parliament. This decision is seen as beneficial to small parties, such as the Left Party and the Free Voters, which may focus their efforts on specific constituencies to try to enter the Bundestag in spite of the 5% threshold.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 06:39 AM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/uk/viborca-reforma-u-nimeccini-bundestag-skorotitsa-na-sotnu-mandativ/a-71594553)\n\n**Friedrich Merz: The Likely Next Chancellor of Germany**\nFriedrich Merz, a 69-year-old lawyer, amateur pilot, and politician, has the highest chances of becoming the next Chancellor of Germany. Merz has never held a government position, but has been fighting for leadership in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) for years. He lost to Angela Merkel and spent several decades in the business world. Now, he is planning an ambitious political comeback and hopes to challenge Olaf Scholz in the upcoming parliamentary elections, including by promising more support for Ukraine. According to current polls, the opposition CDU, led by Merz, has 30% support, while the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Scholz has around 16%. This means that Germany can expect a complex coalition. Merz's party cannot form a government alone, even if it wins the elections, so it will have to seek allies among the social democrats, 'greens', or 'free democrats'. As Politico noted, 'The question is not who will be the next Chancellor of Germany, but rather with whom from his competitors he will lead the country.' Merz's conservatives 'almost certainly' will be at the helm of Germany, regardless of the coalition. 'It's a matter of who will be his partner in government,' said Politico. 'The winner of the election seems to be a rather predictable and conservative figure.' \nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 05:55 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/world/countries/fridrih-merc-kto-eto-zayavleniya-ob-ukraine-i-obeshchaniya-biografiya-karera-i-kto-podderzhivaet-ego-50488771.html)\n\n**Friedrich Merz: The Likely Next Chancellor of Germany**\nEarly elections to the German Bundestag, scheduled after the collapse of the coalition led by Olaf Scholz, will take place this week - February 23. According to current polls, the opposition CDU (led by Friedrich Merz), in a traditional alliance with the Bavarian CSU, currently leads with 30% support. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) comes in second with a record-high result of 21%. Meanwhile, the ruling Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Scholz trails behind with around 16% in the polls. This means that Germany is facing a complex coalition-building process. None of the leading parties plan to cooperate with the notorious far-right AfD. However, even if Merz's CDU wins the elections, it will not be able to form a government alone and will have to seek allies among the social democrats, 'greens', or 'free democrats', who are also likely to enter the Bundestag. One constant in this complex equation is that Friedrich Merz is most likely to become the next Chancellor, regardless of the final coalition composition. 'The question is not who will become the next Chancellor of Germany, but rather with whom he will govern the country,' Politico wrote on February 6, adding that the election winner seems 'boringly predictable' and that Merz's conservatives 'will almost certainly' be at the helm of Germany.' \nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 17, 2025 05:44 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukr/world/countries/fridrih-merc-hto-ce-zayavi-pro-ukrajinu-i-obicyanki-biografiya-kar-yera-y-hto-pidtrimuye-yogo-50488771.html)\n\n**German Next Chancellor Candidate Rules Out Cooperation with Far-Right Party**\nOne week before the German general election on February 23, the leaders of the major parties, including the most likely next Chancellor, Armin Laschet of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), appeared on a televised debate on February 16. Laschet stated that cooperation with the far-right party 'Alternative for Germany (AfD)' is 'absolutely not' an option.

Currently, there are 736 members. Up to 299 seats will be filled by direct candidates from the electoral districts, while at least 331 members will be elected through state lists. The 'overhang and balancing mandates' that have contributed to the Bundestag's growth will be abolished. The second vote in the Bundestag election will remain crucial in determining the number of seats a party receives. The number of electoral districts will remain at 299. The 5% threshold will also remain in place, requiring parties to receive at least 5% of the second votes to enter the Bundestag. However, if a party wins at least three direct mandates in the electoral districts, the 'basic mandate clause' will apply, allowing them to enter the Bundestag even if they fail to meet the 5% threshold. The reform originally aimed to abolish the basic mandate clause, but the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the 5% hurdle without the clause is unconstitutional.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 01:08 PM\nSource:[RP Online](https://rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswahl/bundestagswahl-2025-was-sich-mit-dem-neuen-wahlrecht-aendert_aid-124123941)\n\n**Germany's New Election Law: A Step Towards a More Representative Parliament**\nGermany's new election law will be applied in the upcoming federal election on February 23, which will reduce the number of members of the Federal Parliament significantly. The new law will not change much for voters: the ballot will still be the same, and each voter will have two votes. The first vote is for a direct candidate, and the second vote is for a party. The second vote will be more important after the reform, as it will determine the party's representation in the parliament. The current 733 members of the Federal Parliament will be reduced to 630 after the election. The reform aims to reduce the number of 'over-represented' parties and to make the parliament more representative of the people. According to J\u00f6rg Siegmund, a politics scientist, the reform is a success, as it will reduce the number of 'over-represented' parties and make the parliament more representative. However, the reform will also lead to a reduction in the number of directly elected members, which may lead to a decrease in representation for certain regions. The reform will also abolish the 'over-representation' of parties, which allowed parties to send additional members to the parliament if they received more votes than they were entitled to. This will lead to a reduction in the number of 'over-represented' parties and a more representative parliament. 'The 'over-representation' of parties is a thing of the past,' said J\u00f6rg Siegmund. 'The parliament will be more representative of the people.' \nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[T24](https://t24.com.tr/haber/almanya-yeni-secim-yasasiyla-sandiga-gidecek,1219059)\n\n**Conservative leads German election race in shadow of far right | News**\nGermans are expected to elect conservative Friedrich Merz as their next chancellor on February 23, with polls showing his Christian Democrat party leading at 30 percent. Merz has vowed to shift the country to the right, ending two decades of centrist governance, and has relied on the support of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party in parliament to push through a symbolic motion foreshadowing his planned crackdown on immigration. This move has sparked massive blowback, with tens of thousands taking to the streets and Scholz condemning it as a 'bad omen' for the post-election period. Merz has blamed Scholz for the AfD's rise and argued that centrist forces must work together to prevent the AfD from coming into government. The next government will face daunting challenges, including economic stagnation, a divided society, and a hostile Team Trump. 'It is clear to all the centrist parties that they must work together to prevent the AfD from coming into government and keep it as small as possible,' said Marianne Kneuer, professor of comparative politics at the Technical University Dresden.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2025 03:45 AM\nSource:[Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha (BSS)](https://www.bssnews.net/news/246860)\n\n**Bundestagswahl 2025: Candidates Eager to Take Their Seats**\nThere are approximately 4,506 candidates vying for a seat in the German Bundestag for the 2025 election.

However, her party's influence is growing, and she has publicly stated that she will focus on improving relations with major countries such as China. Von Cramon has expressed concerns that Germany's relationships with neighboring countries and major powers like China and Russia are deteriorating due to a lack of strong leadership. She believes that Germany has failed in immigration, energy, and foreign policy, and has become increasingly hypocritical. If the FDP were to win the election, von Cramon has promised to prioritize improving relations with these major countries. According to a recent poll by Trendence, the FDP currently has 21% support, while the CDU/CSU alliance has 31%, and the SPD and Greens have 15% each. Despite the FDP's current high support rate, the party's chances of entering the government are slim due to the main parties' refusal to form a coalition with them. However, as the FDP's influence grows, the main parties may be forced to take notice. For example, the Greens were initially excluded due to their radical environmental and foreign policies, but after the 2021 federal election, Olaf Scholz formed a coalition with them to secure his position. Although the FDP's pro-Russian and anti-EU stance is unpopular, their support rate is rising, and they may even become the largest party in the parliament. From the current situation, CDU/CSU candidate Merz may become the next Chancellor, but his continuation of traditional policies may not be able to solve Germany's economic and social problems. In the future election, von Cramon's chances may arise. The FDP was founded in 2013, during the Syrian refugee crisis, and quickly rose to prominence with its pro-Russian and anti-EU stance. Elon Musk has even stated that only the FDP can truly save Germany. Germany's problems are complex, and a bold, revolutionary solution like the FDP's may be needed to address them. The rise of far-right forces not only in Germany but also in France is a concern, with Le Pen leading in the polls. The 2024 European Parliament election showed a significant increase in seats for far-right groups. Far-right parties have already taken power in the Netherlands and Italy, and it's possible that the FDP may follow suit in Germany.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 13, 2025 06:45 PM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20250214/47968329.html)\n\n**The battle for 5% that will shape Germany's next government**\nGermany's liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) is struggling to stay above the 5% electoral threshold, which would prevent it from entering parliament in the upcoming national elections. FDP leader Christian Lindner has called on supporters to 'come to the flag now' to preserve the party's potential in parliament. The FDP is not the only party hovering around the threshold, with the left-populist Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW) and Die Linke, Germany's main far-left party, also at risk of failing to enter parliament. A recent poll by Forsa predicted that all three smaller parties would miss the mark, reducing the number of groups in the Bundestag from seven to four. However, another poll by YouGov saw both FDP and BSW above the threshold. If Die Linke also jumps the hurdle, the CDU/CSU's seat share would shrink to 30% and require a three-party coalition, which many dread after Scholz's experiment ended in infighting. 'Anyone who isn't in the Bundestag is no longer relevant in German politics,' Wagenknecht said. Lindner has embraced his new pariah status, playing to an image as the coalition's fiscally hawkish paymaster and citing tech billionaire Elon Musk and Argentinian President Javier Milei as role models for Germany.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2025 08:53 AM\nSource:[EurActiv.com](https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/the-battle-for-5-that-will-shape-germanys-next-government/)\n\n**German Elections: 29 Parties on the Starting Line, But Will They All Finish?**\nIn Germany, 29 parties have registered to participate in the upcoming elections, but only some will make it to the final list in each of the 16 federal states. According to the Federal Election Commissioner (Bundeswahlleiter), 12 parties have failed to overcome bureaucratic hurdles. The large number of parties reflects the diversity of opinions in society, but bureaucratic requirements create a real filter that is difficult to overcome without broad support or financial resources. Traditional forces such as the SPD, Greens, FDP, Left Party, and the Left Party are still dominant across the country, while new players like 'Free Voters', 'Volt', the Marxist-Leninist Party of Germany, 'Alliance Germany', and 'Alliance Sarah Wagenknecht' are trying to carve out their place under the parliamentary sun. However, eight smaller organizations have only managed to register in one federal state, and some candidates have been left out of the electoral competition. To officially participate in the elections, each party must confirm the support of voters with signatures, a mandatory requirement of the German electoral law. According to political scientist Marcus Zivert, small parties face enormous difficulties, lacking resources and infrastructure to collect the necessary number of signatures. 12 parties that failed to do so were not included in the ballots. This once again shows how strict the rules are in Germany when it comes to access to elections. 'The situation raises questions about the permeability of the German system for newcomers,' says FAZ. On the one hand, it ensures that only truly supported parties enter the arena. On the other hand, it sparks a discussion about whether the barriers for innovative players are too high. Although a total of 29 parties will be vying for votes, only a few of them have a real chance of making it to the Bundestag. Experts predict that the main parties will maintain their positions, but new players like 'Alliance Sarah Wagenknecht' may introduce changes to the political landscape. The question remains open: will they be able to win over part of the electorate from traditional parties? The campaign will continue to focus on several key issues, according to Der Spiegel's political observers: climate policy, migration, and economy and social justice. The results of the elections will show which of these themes will take center stage in the German political consciousness.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 04, 2025 11:27 AM\nSource:[mknews.de](https://www.mknews.de/social/2025/02/04/vybory-v-germanii-29-partiy-na-starte-no-vse-li-finishiruyut.html)\n\n**29 Parties to Participate in German General Elections**\nThe German electoral authority announced that 29 parties will participate in the general elections on February 23, with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) as the favorite.

To address this issue, the coalition parties have agreed on a electoral reform that will be implemented for the first time in the upcoming early federal election. According to Professor Norbert Kersting, who researches the party system in Germany, the number of parties has been increasing since 2005, leading to a more fragmented party system. This has resulted in the parliament being expanded by 'Ausgleichs- und \u00dcberhangmandate' and has also led to increased costs. Kersting notes that the principle of 'the more representatives, the better' applies to voter representation. However, the reform aims to address the issue of decreased efficiency in the Bundestag.

The SPD, led by Olaf Scholz, is expected to lose seats and potentially fall to third place behind the hard-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). The AfD is on track to double its share of MPs, but all parties have ruled out coalition talks with them. Smaller parties, including the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) and the Free Democrats (FDP), are struggling to reach the 5% threshold needed to enter parliament.

According to Forsa-Chef Manfred G\u00fcllner, 'small changes in percentage points can have a significant impact on the distribution of seats.'

The Linke is relying on direct mandates to remain a faction, while BSW-Chefin Sahra Wagenknecht is campaigning on a platform of peace and affordable energy imports from Russia. FDP is focusing on a final push in the election campaign, with Parteichef Christian Lindner aiming for a coalition with the Union. The 5% threshold has been criticized for being unfair to smaller parties and potentially distorting the will of the voters.

This comes after a two-day session. All seven parties currently represented in the Bundestag were accepted, including the Social Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Union, the Christian Social Union, the Greens, the Free Democratic Party, the Alternative for Germany, and the Left Party. Additionally, the committee accepted the 'South Schleswig Voters' Association, a party representing Danish and Frisian minorities, which currently has one representative. The party benefits from a special provision in the election law. The committee also accepted parties represented in at least one state parliament, such as the 'Germany Alliance', 'Sarah Wagenknecht Alliance', and the 'Free Voters Party'. The 'Sarah Wagenknecht Alliance' is also currently represented in the Bundestag after its members split from the Left Party. As stated by the electoral committee, 'The parties have met the necessary requirements and will be included in the election.' \nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 07:17 PM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=14012025&id=2a1b3e14-a9a6-4ddc-bfdb-c1f55ba5a7e1)\n\n**41 Parties to Participate in German Federal Election**\nA total of 41 parties will be participating in the German federal election on February 23. The seven parties already represented in the Bundestag, including the SPD, CDU, CSU, Gr\u00fcne, FDP, AfD, and Die Linke, have been officially allowed to participate. Additionally, the parties B\u00fcndnis Deutschland, BSW, and Freie W\u00e4hler, which are represented in at least one state parliament, have been granted permission. The list is completed by 31 smaller organizations, which have been officially recognized as parties by the Federal Election Committee.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 02:44 PM\nSource:[rtl.de](https://www.rtl.de/HBBTV/Teletext/Newsde/bundestagswahl-mit-41-parteien-id2030746.html)\n\n**BSW, FDP, and Linke on the Brink: The Consequences of the 5% Threshold**\nThe upcoming German federal election could result in a record number of parties in the Bundestag, with up to eight parties potentially represented. The performance of smaller parties, including the B\u00fcndnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), the Free Democratic Party (FDP), and the Left Party (Linke), will be crucial in determining the outcome. According to Manfred G\u00fcllner, a researcher at the Institut Forsa, 'verschiebungen von wenigen Prozentpunkten haben gro\u00dfen Einfluss auf die Mandatsverteilung' (small shifts in percentage points have a significant impact on seat distribution). If the current polling numbers hold, only four parties - the Union, SPD, Gr\u00fcne, and AfD - would be represented in the Bundestag. However, if the BSW, Linke, and FDP enter the parliament, there would be seven parties. In the worst-case scenario, there could be eight parties, including the Freie W\u00e4hler, who are trying to secure three direct mandates in Bavaria. The potential coalition options would be significantly different depending on the outcome. 'Wir haben allein im letzten Jahr 14.000 neue Mitglieder gewonnen', said Linken-Chef Jan van Aken, who is also the party's top candidate. 'Wir wissen, was die Bev\u00f6lkerung bewegt', he added, citing the party's focus on reducing rents and prices. The BSW's founder, Sahra Wagenknecht, expressed confidence in her party's chances, attributing their current struggles to a hostile media environment. The FDP, meanwhile, is trying to regain momentum, with party leader Christian Lindner calling for a return to power with the Union as their new partner.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 04:18 AM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/bsw-fdp-und-linke-zittern-die-folgen-der-prozent-huerde-zr-93511303.html)\n\n**German Election: Small Parties Could Shake Up Politics**\nThe upcoming German federal election could result in a parliament with up to eight parties, depending on the performance of smaller parties. The FDP, Linke, and BSW are among those that could enter the parliament. According to Manfred G\u00fcllner from the Forsa Institute, 'Verschiebungen von wenigen Prozentpunkten haben gro\u00dfen Einfluss auf die Mandatsverteilung' ('small changes in percentage points have a big impact on seat distribution'). If the current political mood is reflected in the election results, only four parties would be represented in the new Bundestag. However, if BSW, Linke, and FDP enter the parliament, there would be seven parties. In the worst-case scenario, there could be eight parties, including the Freie W\u00e4hler, who are trying to win three direct mandates in Bavaria. The government formation would be very different depending on the outcome. 'Die Union h\u00e4tte dann nur noch mit der SPD und der AfD sowie mit den Gr\u00fcnen und der FDP zusammen eine Mehrheit', writes G\u00fcllner ('the Union would then only have a majority with the SPD and the AfD, as well as the Greens and the FDP'). For the three parties themselves, it's all or nothing. If they fail to enter the Bundestag, they would lose attention and a significant portion of state funding. Despite this, they are optimistic about their chances and believe they would be needed. 'Wir haben allein im letzten Jahr 14.000 neue Mitglieder gewonnen', says Linken-Chef Jan van Aken ('we have gained 14,000 new members alone in the last year'). The Linke is focusing on issues such as rent and price reductions, while the BSW is emphasizing peace and the import of cheap energy from Russia. The FDP is making a comeback, despite poor poll numbers, and is focusing on economic change and debt brakes.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 13, 2025 04:16 AM\nSource:[rheinpfalz.de](https://www.rheinpfalz.de/politik_artikel,-bsw-fdp-und-linke-zittern-die-folgen-der-5-prozent-h%C3%BCrde-_arid,5732549.html)\n\n**56 Parties Apply to Participate in German Federal Election**\nA total of 56 parties and political associations have applied to participate in the upcoming German federal election. According to Bundeswahlleiterin Ruth Brand, the deadline for applications was yesterday. However, only parties and political associations that are not represented in the federal parliament or a state parliament with at least five members need to apply. The Federal Election Committee will now decide in all cases whether the conditions are met to participate in the election. The public session will take place at the latest on January 14 in a committee room of the Bundestag. Parties represented in the federal parliament or a state parliament can submit their state lists or district election proposals to the relevant local authorities by January 20. The decision on the admission of these proposals will be made on January 24. The federal election is scheduled to take place on February 23. 'The deadline for applications has expired,' said Brand. 'Now it's up to the Federal Election Committee to decide on the participation of the parties.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 08, 2025 12:17 PM\nSource:[Der Tagesspiegel](https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/ausschuss-entscheidet-uber-zulassung-56-parteien-beantragen-teilnahme-an-bundestagswahl-12980410.html)\n\n",

In the 2021 German federal elections, there were six main parties that secured seats: SPD, CDU/CSU, Greens, FDP, AfD, and The Left. Historically, the Bundestag has seen between 5 to 7 parties consistently over recent election cycles, reflecting the proportional representation system in Germany. Thus, I base my probabilities on these historical patterns: '5 or fewer' parties are rarer now due to political fragmentation, while '6' and '7' are more probable. '8' and '9 or more' are less likely given the relative stability and thresholds required for parliamentary entry (5% hurdle).",
