    "question": "Will the World Health Organization prequalify moxidectin before April 1, 2025?",
    "description": "In June 2024, GiveWell made a $637,549 grant to [Medicines Development for Global Health](https://www.medicinesdevelopment.com/) (MDGH), a not-for-profit pharmaceutical organization focused on developing medicines for neglected diseases in low- and middle-income countries, to complete the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO\u2019s) prequalification process for moxidectin.\n\nAccording to [the WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis):\n\n>Onchocerciasis, commonly known as \u201criver blindness\u201d, is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted to humans through exposure to repeated bites of infected blackflies of the genus Simulium. Symptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness. More than 99% of infected people live in 31 African countries. The disease also exists in some foci in two countries in Latin America (the Yanomani area in Brazil and Venezuela) and Yemen.\n\nAs of September 2024, the WHO [recommends](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/onchocerciasis) annual ivermectin treatments for 10-15 years to treat onchocerciasis. Ivermectin works by killing the larval worms or microfilariae and by temporarily stopping the adult female worms from producing more.\n\nHowever, ivermectin has some limitations, according to the [WHO](https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/367431/9789240071469-eng.pdf), including resistance in some places and adverse reactions among people who also have Loa loa infection. According to the WHO, moxidectin is a safe and effective alternative that is effective for longer and has been shown in trials to reduce skin microfilariae more than in people treated with ivermectin. It may also be a more cost-saving treatment.\n\nIn 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [approved](https://tdr.who.int/activities/moxidectin-a-new-drug-for-ntds) moxidectin for treatment of onchocerciasis in individuals 12 years and older, making it the first new drug for onchocerciasis to be approved in the US in 20 years and worldwide in 30 years. \n\nHowever, the WHO has [unexpectedly required](https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers) extensive extra clinical trials for moxidectin, casting its near term WHO prequalification (PQ) status into a level of uncertainty. PQ status [would help](https://www.medicinesdevelopment.com/our-work/medicines) get the medicine approved and licensed for usage in many countries. In its internal forecasting, GiveWell has assigned a 80% likelihood of moxidectin being prequalified before 2027.\n\nAccording to the [Global Health Council](https://globalhealth.org/member-spotlight-medicines-development-for-global-health/):\n\n>Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) is an independent biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of affordable medicines for the people who need them most. MDGH is a not-for-profit company that uses all funds in excess of running costs to develop medicines that address important unmet medical needs but may have limited commercial opportunities. \n\n>In June 2018, the FDA approved moxidectin for the treatment of the Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) onchocerciasis (also known as river blindness), a devastating and debilitating microfilarial disease that causes intense itching, severe dermatitis and skin depigmentation. As the disease progresses it can also cause blindness, and this condition is the second-most common cause of infectious blindness in the world. 200 million people are estimated to be at risk from this disease, and its elimination is a longstanding goal for the WHO.\n\nSee Also:\n\n- Kura et al. (2023) - [Can mass drug administration of moxidectin accelerate onchocerciasis elimination in Africa?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2022.0277) (PDF)\n- [Prequalification of medicines by WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/prequalification-of-medicines-by-who)\n- Global Health Council's member spotlight page for [Medicines Development for Global Health](https://globalhealth.org/member-spotlight-medicines-development-for-global-health/), Moxidectin's current license holder in the US.",
    "fine_print": "Note that this question resolves **Yes** only if moxidectin achieves PQ approval for the treatment of onchocerciasis. If moxidectin achieves PQ approval for another indication, but not onchocerciasis, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAlthough Medicines Development for Global Health (MDGH) is developing moxidectin for potential WHO PQ, this question resolves regardless of which entity achieves the PQ.",

SYMBRAVO demonstrated rapid and long-lasting freedom from migraine pain, with 85% and 77% of patients not requiring rescue medication within 24 hours in two Phase 3 studies. The medication targets multiple migraine attack pathways and is designed to provide rapid, enhanced, and consistent migraine pain relief. The most common adverse reactions were somnolence and dizziness. SYMBRAVO is available in 20 mg meloxicam / 10 mg rizatriptan tablets. The company will host a conference call and webcast on January 31 to discuss the approval. Dr. Stewart Tepper, Clinical Professor of Neurology at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, will join the call and be available to answer questions. The FDA approval of SYMBRAVO is based on the results of three Phase 3 trials, which treated over 21,000 migraine attacks. The medication is engineered with Axsome's patented MoSEICTM (Molecular Solubility Enhanced Inclusion Complex) rapid absorption technology, which enables the rapid absorption of meloxicam while maintaining a long plasma half-life. SYMBRAVO is protected by a robust patent estate extending out to at least 2040. Herriot Tabuteau, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Axsome Therapeutics, said, 'Today's approval of SYMBRAVO marks an important milestone for the migraine community by providing a rationally designed novel acute treatment for this debilitating condition.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 08:52 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/25/01/g43351848/axsome-therapeutics-announces-fda-approval-of-symbravo-meloxicam-and-rizatriptan-for-the-acute-tre)\n\n**Italian Government Approves Decree to Adapt to European Medicines Tracking System**\nThe Italian government has approved a decree to adapt the country's regulations to the European Union's system for tracking medicines, which aims to prevent counterfeiting. The decree, which has been highly anticipated in the sector, introduces sanctions of up to \u20ac140,000 for producers, wholesalers, and pharmacists who do not comply with the new rules or falsify the new labels. However, a 'stabilization' period has been established, during which companies and pharmacies will have to adapt to the new instructions provided by the Ministry of Health. This period, which will last from February 9, 2025 to February 8, 2027, will be a sort of derogation, during which many of the sanctions will not be applied. The decree also provides for the creation of a national archive linked to the European Medicines Verification System (EMVS) to verify the authenticity of medicines. The Italian government has been one of the first European countries to introduce a system of labeling to track medicines sold with a prescription and over-the-counter medicines. The new system will replace the current 'bollino farmaceutico' (pharmaceutical label) with a common system used in all EU countries. According to the decree, during the 'stabilization' period, the adaptation to the European regulation will be applied gradually. The two-year period will be used for 'verification, deactivation, and reactivation of the unique identifier' based on the instructions provided by the Ministry of Health after the entry into force of the decree. A commission of experts will be established to monitor the developments during the next two years. Until 2027, the pharmaceutical label will also serve as an anti-counterfeiting system. The lots of medicines produced before February 9, 2025, on which the pharmaceutical label has been affixed, can still be sold until the expiration date without being re-packaged and re-labeled.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 30, 2025 08:44 AM\nSource:[ilpost.it](https://www.ilpost.it/2025/01/30/approvato-decreto-confezioni-farmaci-contraffazione/?homepagePosition=12)\n\n**Six years, 'lost' documents, litigation fatigue: The hopelessness of public health advocacy in India**\nThe author withdrew a petition filed six years ago in the Delhi High Court questioning the continued sale of three drugs whose initial approvals by the Drug Controller General of India have been under a cloud of suspicion.

The petition was driven by sheer litigation fatigue, with the case being listed no less than 24 times before the Delhi High Court over the last six years with no substantial arguments taking place on any of the issues that the author raised before court. The author had challenged the approvals of the drugs, which were flagged by the Parliamentary Committee for lacking therapeutic rationale, but the government continued to delay filing a response before the court. The author's co-author discovered that the Drugs Controller General of India had set up an inquiry committee to investigate the approvals, but the report was never published and the annexures containing copies of the approval files were lost. The author's petition was finally withdrawn on January 14, 2025, after eight occasions before four different judges between September 2022 and January 14, 2025, with no concrete outcome.

Kennedy Jr, the nominee chosen by President Donald Trump to lead the main US health agency, told US senators during his confirmation hearing that he would finalize regulations to increase the participation of diverse patient populations in clinical trials. This statement comes after the removal of diversity-related projects and information from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website last Friday. Mr. Kennedy was nominated to head the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA. When asked by Democratic Senator Ben Ray Lujan if he would commit to finalizing the FDA's diversity guidelines for clinical trials, Mr. Kennedy replied, 'Yes.' The FDA's draft guidelines for a diversity action plan for pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers respond to a requirement stated in the 2022 Omnibus Food and Drug Reform Act. Historically, most available clinical trial data are based on white patients and may not account for differences in how medications and devices work or their side effects in various patient populations. The law aims to increase participation from underrepresented groups, including Blacks and Hispanic Americans. The guidelines will require manufacturers to set goals and detail their strategies for recruiting people from diverse populations for each advanced-stage medication and device clinical trial subject to US regulatory review. The directive was due to be finalized by June 2025, and the reason for its removal from the FDA website is unclear. Spokespeople for the HHS and FDA declined to comment, citing a Trump administration-imposed moratorium on communications until February 1.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 29, 2025 07:30 PM\nSource:[zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/actualite-bourse/Kennedy-declare-qu-il-finalisera-les-regles-visant-a-accroitre-la-diversite-dans-les-essais-cli-48905275/)\n\n**Effective immediately: CDC can't talk to WHO. What will that mean for world health?**\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been ordered to stop communicating with the World Health Organization (WHO) immediately, effective from January 29, 2025. This decision comes after President Trump's announcement to withdraw from the WHO, citing its 'mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic,' unequal payments from member states, and 'inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.' The ban on communication does not allow for a transition period, and officials are trying to understand the ramifications of this order for the US and the world. 'This is unprecedented,' says Javier Guzman, the director of global health policy at the Center for Global Development. The CDC and WHO collaborate on various health efforts, including the ongoing efforts to quash a major mpox outbreak in parts of Africa and an outbreak of Marburg virus in Tanzania. The ban on communication could hinder the country's ability to prevent humans from being infected as well as to develop medications and vaccines to combat diseases. 'Not only is it reckless, but I think it's lawless,' says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of WHO's Center on Global Health Law. 'We criticize China relentlessly for failing to abide by [IHR] in rapid reporting and communicating of the Wuhan outbreak.

According to data shared by the health minister, the incidence of TB has reduced from 237 per 100,000 people in 2015 to 195 in 2023, and the TB mortality rate has decreased from 28 to 22 in the same period. The government has also made significant progress in other health programs, including reducing missing TB cases from 1.5 million in 2015 to 150,000 in 2024.

Experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) are skeptical about whether global health systems are prepared for a new pandemic. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated, 'The answer is yes and no.' While the world has made progress in addressing weaknesses and vulnerabilities, it still faces challenges in sharing information about new pathogens and distributing vaccines and medications. Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO's Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness Department, believes it's only a matter of time before the next pandemic emerges. The WHO's Independent Panel on Pandemic Preparedness and Response also expressed concerns about unequal access to vaccines and medications worldwide. US epidemiologist Meg Scheffer is also skeptical, stating, 'Honestly, no, I don't think we're better prepared than we were for Covid.' However, she notes that people have learned how to protect themselves and others from infection, such as through regular handwashing and mask-wearing. Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans sees the rapid development of mRNA vaccines during the pandemic as a glimmer of hope, but warns of increasing vaccine skepticism and misinformation, which could lead to 'big problems' in future vaccination campaigns.

Innovative public health measures have reduced malaria-related mortality in Africa from 808,000 in 2000 to 580,000 in 2022, with nine African countries having already eradicated the disease. Malaria vaccines, such as GSK's Mosquirix and the Serum Institute of India's R21/Matrix-M, have shown promise, but a shortage of the R21 vaccine in Africa hinders its availability. In the US, about 2,000 cases of malaria are diagnosed annually, mainly in returning travelers from Africa. As of November 2024, the US CDC reported 1,772 malaria cases, with Florida recording 68 cases of travel-related malaria. The CDC recommends preventing malaria infections by taking antimalarials and preventing mosquito bites, as the US FDA has not approved either malaria vaccine.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2025 10:16 AM\nSource:[precisionvaccinations.com](https://www.vax-before-travel.com/will-malaria-vaccines-defend-usa-2025-2025-01-07)\n\n**Ex-COVID Czar Wants Mandates for Bird Flu Vaccine Before 2025**\nDr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore Health Commissioner and Planned Parenthood president, is calling for the expedited approval of a bird flu vaccine before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration in 2025.

Gilead's CEO, Daniel O'Day, noted that the initiative would accelerate access to lenacapavir, allowing more people to benefit from the drug from the outset.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 07:25 AM\nSource:[Khaleej times](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/world/americas/new-hiv-prevention-drug-could-reach-poorest-countries-by-2025)\n\n**New HIV Prevention Medication Could Reach Low-Income Countries by 2025 or 2026**\nA new long-acting HIV prevention medication, lenacapavir, could be available in low-income countries by the end of 2025 or early 2026, according to a global health official. The goal is to start supplying the medication in that timeframe, said Hui Yang, the supply chain operations manager at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. However, many things need to happen first, including regulatory approvals from authorities like the US Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization. Lenacapavir is already approved for use as a treatment for multi-resistant HIV and costs around $42,250 for the first year of therapy in the US. Clinical trials this year showed that it is also very effective in preventing infection, and Gilead is seeking approval for its new use worldwide. 'We don't want low- and middle-income countries to be at the end of the line' when these approvals come, said Yang, referring to the long-standing issues of inequality in the fight against HIV. To avoid this, the Global Fund announced that it will partner with the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and funding from the Children's Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to support affordable access to the costly medication in the countries they work with 'from day one'. The groups did not provide further details on how this would work, except to say that they aim to reach at least two million people in three years. In October of this year, Gilead signed agreements with six generic medication manufacturers to produce and sell lenacapavir at a lower cost in 120 low- and middle-income countries. However, Yang said that no agreements have been signed with Gilead or any of these generic manufacturers yet, but they will work with all the involved companies.

Kennedy Jr., Aaron Siri, has petitioned the FDA to halt the distribution of the polio vaccine in the US until further studies are conducted. The petition, filed in 2022, requests that trials including placebos be conducted before approval can be reinstated. However, experts consider this approach unethical due to the real risks of polio, which can cause paralysis and seizure of major organs. Dr. Paul A. Offit, a vaccine expert, stated, 'You're substituting a theoretical risk for a real risk. The real risks are the diseases.' Despite Kennedy's apparent softening of his anti-vaccine stance, he remains supportive of Siri's efforts. The FDA has yet to make a decision on the petition, which was first submitted in February 2023.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 13, 2024 09:20 PM\nSource:[Newser](https://www.newser.com/story/361042/ally-of-rfk-jr-wants-halt-to-polio-vaccinations-in-us.html)\n\n**NHS to roll out 'King Kong of weight loss jabs'**\nThe National Health Service (NHS) in England will begin administering Mounjaro, a weight-loss jab, to patients starting in March 2025. However, due to capacity constraints, only about 220,000 people with the highest clinical needs will have access to the medication over the next three years, which is less than 10% of the estimated 3.4 million people who meet the eligibility criteria. The NHS has requested a 12-year rollout period, which has been criticized by patient groups and experts. Professor Jonathan Benger, chief medical officer at NICE, stated, 'The world will look very different in three years which is why we've taken the unprecedented decision to review the way this medicine is delivered to patients then.' Mounjaro has demonstrated significant effectiveness in clinical trials, with participants losing an average of 20.2% of their body weight. The medication reduces appetite and slows digestion by mimicking the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which regulates hunger and feelings of fullness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 08, 2024 07:28 AM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/science/science-around-the-world/article-832437)\n\n",
