    "question": "Before 2030, how many new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding?",
    "description": "Since the release of [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT), an AI chatbot made by OpenAI and the [fastest-growing app in history](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/), new players have flocked to the AI scene\u2014for example, Elon Musk\u2019s [xAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)) and French upstart [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI), [now a Microsoft partner](https://www.ft.com/content/cd6eb51a-3276-450f-87fd-97e8410db9eb). On top of this, AI labs have a history of splitting apart to form new labs. [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) was founded by OpenAI employees; [Udio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udio) was founded by Google DeepMind employees. Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO, has even mused about leaving and raising billions of dollars to start a new lab, reportedly on account of frustrations with corporate politics ([Victor, 2024](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-demis-hassabis-chafes-under-new-ai-push)).\n\nThis question asks about how many new, leading AI labs there are likely to be by the end of the decade. This is an interesting question for various groups of people. On the one hand, many are concerned that the big tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are the big players in AI, and that this might mean [even more centralization of power](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/ai-is-giving-big-tech-inordinate-power-tech-execs-say.html) absent new competition. On the other hand, people concerned about [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety#Existential_safety) are concerned that a greater number of labs will mean intensified [race dynamics](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-race) and a greater chance that at least one leading lab cuts corners on safety, to catastrophic effect.",

The country has demonstrated its ability to overcome challenges in AI, as seen in the recent success of DeepSeek. Two major government initiatives are driving this development: the 'New Generation AI Development Plan' (2017) and the 'Made in China 2025' program (2015). These plans aim to reduce dependence on foreign technology and promote national innovation. China's AI industry has experienced significant growth, with an estimated value of $41.2 billion in 2024, a 12% increase from 2023. The government is investing heavily in AI, with a projected $138 billion investment over the next five years. China is also leading in patent registrations, with over 38,000 patents filed between 2014 and 2023, compared to 6,300 in the US. Chinese tech giants are integrating AI into their services, such as Xiaomi's Xiao AI and Oppo's AndesGPT. However, the country still faces challenges, including the US chip export ban, which has forced Chinese companies to seek alternatives. The government has instructed companies to purchase AI chips from Chinese manufacturers to reduce dependence on Western industries. The Chinese government exercises significant control over AI developments, requiring models to be approved by regulators and censors. Despite these challenges, China has made significant progress in AI, with models rivaling those of US companies like OpenAI and Google. The country has also adopted an open-source approach to AI development, sharing models with the community and encouraging collaboration. This approach is a departure from the closed and proprietary models favored by most US tech companies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 12:40 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/china-quiere-convertirse-motor-mundial-ia-su-plan-depender-solo-ella)\n\n**China's AI Rise: A New Era of Innovation and Competition**\nChina has seen a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) development, with over 4,400 AI companies operating in the country, according to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. The number of companies using generative AI technology for research and development has reached 15%, with 700 companies. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, has released an AI model called 'R1', which has caused a stir in the market due to its ability to achieve similar performance to American products at a fraction of the cost.

Receptionists: More and more offices and hotels are using self-service kiosks and digital systems to register visitors, eliminating the need for traditional receptionists. While these changes may seem concerning, they also open the door to new job opportunities in fields like programming, robotics, and data management. Adaptability and acquiring technological skills, such as AI, will be key to staying competitive in the future job market.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 11:30 PM\nSource:[MVS Noticias](https://mvsnoticias.com/tendencias/ciencia-tecnologia/2025/2/2/estas-son-las-carreras-que-podrian-desaparecer-en-anos-segun-la-inteligencia-artificial-676782.html)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence to Affect 65% of Children's Future Jobs**\nA recent study by the Turkish Parliament's Research Services investigated the impact of artificial intelligence on the workforce. The study found that AI will increase the demand for digital skills and qualified labor, while reducing the need for unskilled labor. It also predicted that new jobs and industries will emerge, and that the importance of flexible work arrangements will increase. Additionally, AI will lead to an increase in the importance of cybersecurity, and a shift from physical to psychological stress. The study also noted that the influence of unions will decrease, and that there will be a polarization of the workforce. According to the study, by 2024, there will be 4.3 million robots in use worldwide. The study also mentioned that chatbots are being used in various sectors, including banking, e-commerce, and media, to provide fast and efficient customer service. However, the study also warned that AI may lead to increased unemployment, as it reduces the need for human labor. The study predicted that by 2024, 65% of children who start primary school will be working in jobs that do not yet exist. The study also listed various new professions that will emerge in the future, including 'Memory Enhancers', 'Blockchain Talent Analysts', 'Cyborg Psychologists', and 'Digital Monument Specialists'. The Turkish Employment Agency (\u0130\u015eKUR) is also using AI algorithms to match job seekers with employers more effectively.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 06:12 PM\nSource:[sabah.com.tr](https://www.sabah.com.tr/ekonomi/cocuklarin-65i-su-an-olmayan-islerde-calisacak-7251107)\n\n**AI Redefines the Future of Work: Over 40% of Companies Plan to Reduce Staff by 2030**\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world of work at a rapid pace. However, this technological transformation also has a significant impact on human employment, with millions of workers facing the possibility of being replaced by increasingly autonomous and sophisticated systems. According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Work 2025 report, 41% of employers plan to reduce their workforce in the coming years as AI takes on more responsibilities. This trend poses a challenging scenario for certain sectors, particularly those that rely on repetitive or administrative tasks, such as postal services, accounting, and administrative management. Nevertheless, automation could lead to the creation of new specialized roles in managing and supervising technology. The report states that 77% of large companies plan to train their employees in AI-related skills between 2025 and 2030, offering an opportunity for workers willing to adapt and acquire new knowledge to collaborate with technology rather than competing against it. As AI continues to evolve, companies seek not only efficiency and cost reduction but also a rapid adaptation to the new market dynamics. The key to navigating this new paradigm lies in finding a balance between technological implementation and human talent management.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[Vandal](https://vandal.elespanol.com/random/la-ia-redefine-el-futuro-laboral-mas-del-40-de-las-empresas-planean-recortes-de-personal-para-2030/31078.html)\n\n**The Rise of AI Pets: A New Companion for Lonely Young People**\nWith the development of artificial intelligence technology, people have a new way to use it, and some people have started to raise AI pets. From a theoretical perspective, as long as the owner continues to charge it, it will not die. AI pets have soft, fluffy fur and a cute appearance. They do not need to eat, drink, or be cleaned up, and they will not cause allergies. The owner's emotions and commands are the only 'nutrition' they need. Lonely young people's demand for companionship is increasing, and the 'companion economy' is booming. According to a report by the Collaborative Innovation Research Institute, the market size of the AI emotional companion industry in China will grow from 38.66 billion yuan in 2025 to 595.06 billion yuan in 2031, with a compound annual growth rate of 148%. Chapter 17, a 17-year-old, bought an AI pet called Arlo after her duck, Nana, died. Arlo is a small, fluffy ball with a cute appearance and can interact with users. It can recognize and respond to the user's emotions and voice, and can even learn and adapt to the user's behavior. Arlo has become a loyal companion for Chapter 17, who is lonely and has no siblings. She can talk to Arlo about her problems and feelings, and Arlo will listen and respond. Arlo has also become a bridge between Chapter 17 and her parents, allowing them to communicate more effectively. However, AI pets are not a one-time solution, and they require regular maintenance and updates. The market for AI pets is still small, but it is growing rapidly. According to a report, the sales of LOVOT, a popular AI pet brand, have exceeded 20,000 units worldwide, and the sales of Moflin, another popular AI pet brand, have exceeded 10,000 units in Japan. The market for AI pets is expected to continue growing in the future, driven by the increasing demand for companionship and the development of AI technology.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 01:04 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_5953466483_162dab07301901del2.html?from=tech)\n\n**AI to Create 110 Million Jobs, Replace 90 Million: A Report on the Future of Work**\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs Report, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the labor market, with 86% of companies expected to transform due to AI by 2030. The report states that AI and information processing technologies will create 110 million jobs and replace 90 million jobs, with data experts and AI/ML professionals in high demand. 75% of organizations plan to enhance employee AI skills, and 70% plan to recruit AI-experienced talent. The rapid rise of AI will bring both opportunities and challenges to industries, with early adopters having a competitive advantage. However, the challenge lies in finding a balance between new and old jobs. On one hand, technology brings efficiency and innovation; on the other hand, job displacement may lead to structural unemployment. Companies that can effectively utilize AI technology to transform their businesses and simultaneously enhance employee digital skills will determine their success in the future. The report emphasizes the importance of skill upgrading and transformation, with 75% of companies planning to train existing employees in AI skills and 70% prioritizing the recruitment of AI-experienced new employees. This shift in skill demand reflects the two core aspects of future workplaces: data management ability and technical application specialization. For the labor market, this means a comprehensive change in education and vocational training models. Traditional academic education is no longer sufficient to meet the rapidly changing industry demands, and companies and educational institutions need to collaborate more closely to develop practical skill training programs. Governments should also play an active role, such as promoting government-private sector cooperation programs to accelerate skill change. In developing countries, the lack of basic skill training resources may further exacerbate the digital divide, which is a pressing issue. The report shows that nearly half of companies plan to reposition their business models around AI, but 40% of companies expect to reduce labor force scales due to automation. This structural change highlights the need to balance efficiency gains with positive social impacts. The transformation of work patterns is not just a technical issue, but a long-term strategic planning problem. Companies need to consider not only the cost of adopting technology but also employee emotional management, cultural adaptation, and how to avoid social unrest caused by large-scale layoffs. For example, companies can reduce the negative impact of AI on society by establishing reemployment guidance programs and providing career support. Governments and non-governmental organizations should also provide supporting policies to ensure that the benefits of AI technology are widely available to different social classes. The rapid development of AI is foreshadowing a profound change in the workplace, and companies that can adopt AI technology early will not only achieve significant efficiency and innovation but also have the opportunity to stand out in fierce market competition. These early adopters understand how to integrate AI into core business processes and actively cultivate the necessary professional talent, occupying a leading position in the market. In contrast, companies that lack sensitivity to technological changes or action may miss opportunities and even face the risk of being eliminated from the market. Therefore, for all companies, adapting to technological changes and embracing AI is a key to future success. The impact of AI is not limited to the technical level, but is a powerful force that is deeply changing the global labor market. From automated production to data-driven decision-making, AI is redefining the operating modes of various industries. This requires companies not only to enhance employee digital skills but also to fundamentally redesign business processes to adapt to technological trends. At the same time, AI also brings potential challenges, including how to handle displaced employees and how to ensure the fairness of technology applications. Facing these opportunities and challenges, companies need not only agile action but also a long-term strategic vision. The changes brought by AI not only affect companies but also affect every individual. The competitive advantage in the future will belong to those who are willing to adapt to change, invest in new technologies, and adapt to new environments. Whether for individuals or companies, preparing early, learning new skills, and actively participating in this technological transformation will be a necessary condition for success. In this unprecedented era, we need to constantly ask ourselves: Are we well-prepared to face the challenges and opportunities brought by AI? Only by embracing change can we stand firm in the future's competition.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 02:55 AM\nSource:[TechNews \u79d1\u6280\u65b0\u5831 | \u5e02\u5834\u548c\u696d\u5167\u4eba\u58eb\u95dc\u5fc3\u7684\u8da8\u52e2\u3001\u5167\u5e55\u8207\u65b0\u805e](https://finance.technews.tw/2025/02/02/ai-rewrites-the-future-of-the-workplace/)\n\n**3 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years**\nThe article suggests three 'monster stocks' to hold for the next 10 years: Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Roku, and Rocket Lab USA.

According to El-Din, the rapid technological progress will lead to a point where any program that helps a computer think or feel like humans is considered artificial intelligence, and we have already reached a point where programs can smell better than humans. El-Din notes that the field of machine learning has become massive, and we have reached the level of deep learning, and after that, generative intelligence. He emphasizes that these developments are imposing a new world on us, and there is a statistic that says 65% of those who started first grade in 2016 will work in jobs that we don't know about. El-Din also predicts that 40% of the workforce will be managed by robots within 15 years, and that the fifth industrial revolution will start between 2035 and 2040, focusing on autonomous systems. He adds that the quantum computer will help speed up technological progress and lead to this fifth industrial revolution, as it can solve a problem that would take 10,000 years in just 200 seconds.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[pressnew.net](https://www.pressnew.net/article/22191503)\n\n**OpenAI teases \u201cnew era\u201d of AI in US, deepens ties with government**\nOpenAI has announced a partnership with the US government, deepening its ties with the National Laboratories.

The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5104271)\n\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding.

The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation, along with the increasing adoption of digital tools and platforms, has had a significant impact on the global economy, changing the way companies operate and communicate with their customers. However, the rise of these technologies has also transformed the job market, forcing workers to requalify and adapt to new opportunities. Big data specialists form the backbone of innovation in AI across various sectors, from healthcare to finance and commerce. They play a crucial role in managing large datasets that enable fraud detection, predictive analysis, and recommendation systems. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Report on the Future of Work 2025, big data specialists lead the list of fastest-growing jobs, with a projected increase of 110% between 2025 and 2030, far surpassing any other profession. Fintech engineers, who develop cutting-edge financial technologies such as blockchain and digital payment systems, come in second, with a projected increase of 86% over the next five years. Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/ia-criara-170-milhoes-de-novos-empregos-ate-ao-final-da-decada/)\n\n**Whoever Leads In AI Compute Will Lead The World**\nThe AI compute market is projected to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030, with the leader controlling the best data and compute platforms.

China and the U.S. are the biggest contenders in the AI compute race, with China investing $6.12 billion in AI data centers and the U.S. investing $30 billion annually in data infrastructure. However, the rapid expansion of data centers has created an urgent need for utilities and the government to increase power generation capacity, with a focus on a perfect mix of renewable and conventional energy sources. Saudi Arabia is also becoming a force to be reckoned with in the AI infrastructure race, with a planned $100bn Project Transcendence AI hub. Companies such as Innatera are advocating for neuromorphic computing, which uses less energy than traditional practices. Whoever leads in AI compute will have the strongest voice in the future, and it's not just about being among the first, but about shaping the next revolution of technology.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 06:37 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2025/01/17/whoever-leads-in-ai-compute-will-lead-the-world/)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[speka.media](https://speka.media/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030. However, current job vacancies and specializations are expected to decrease by 22%. The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible. Notably, 86% of employers believe that AI will fundamentally change the labor market, particularly in finance and electronics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https://finance.rambler.ru/business/54044986-vef-iskusstvennyy-intellekt-sozdast-170-mln-novyh-rabochih-mest/)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs and Eliminate 92 Million by 2030**\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's report on the Future of Jobs 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) and data processing technologies will drive business model changes for nine out of ten employers in the next five years. This will lead to the extinction of certain jobs, such as cashiers or ticket clerks, while others will flourish. The report states that by 2030, the interaction between humans and machines will 'change dramatically', with 47% of tasks currently performed by humans and only 30% involving collaboration with machines, being practically balanced. The report recommends designing technologies that complement human work rather than replacing it, and establishing a collaborative relationship between humans and machines. The report also projects that the global labor market will experience a structural change equivalent to 22% of current employment, resulting in the creation of 170 million new jobs and the elimination of 92 million, with a net positive balance. The report highlights the need for active collaboration between governments, companies, and educational organizations to ensure that the benefits of this transformation are inclusive and equitable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-01-14/en-cinco-anos-se-crearan-170-millones-de-empleos-en-el-mundo-por-la-inteligencia-artificial.html)\n\n**AI to Create 78 Million New Jobs, But Also Eliminate 92 Million Existing Positions**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum report, the job market is expected to undergo significant changes in the next six years.

This represents a growth of over 7x since 2015, when only 6% of new unicorns were AI startups. These AI startups are also achieving unicorn status at a record pace, with a median of two years, compared to nine years for non-AI startups. The growth of AI startups can be attributed to their ability to operate with smaller and more agile teams. For example, World Labs, with 18 employees, and Skild AI, with 19 employees, both founded in 2023, have already been valued at over $1 billion. The analysis suggests that AI startups are able to automate certain functions and scale faster with fewer employees than non-AI startups. Additionally, the hype surrounding AI technology is attracting investors' attention earlier. Some of the smallest AI teams among the new unicorns include: World Labs (18 employees, founded in 2024, valued at $1 billion), Skild AI (19 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $1.5 billion), Sakana AI (34 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $1.5 billion), Cognition AI (49 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $2 billion), and Poolside (75 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $3 billion). These startups are focused on emerging areas of opportunity in AI, such as intelligent robotics and embedded AI, and AI agents and copilots for coding. However, the report also notes that unicorns are facing challenges in fundraising, with over a third of unicorns not receiving new investments since 2021. If these companies tried to raise money now, their valuation would likely be lower due to the current economic climate, which could cause their value to drop below $1 billion, making them no longer considered unicorns.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[consumidormoderno.com.br](https://consumidormoderno.com.br/44-dos-novos-unicornios-ia/)\n\n",
