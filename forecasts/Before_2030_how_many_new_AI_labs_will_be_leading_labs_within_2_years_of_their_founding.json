    "description": "Since the release of [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT), an AI chatbot made by OpenAI and the [fastest-growing app in history](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/), new players have flocked to the AI scene\u2014for example, Elon Musk\u2019s [xAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)) and French upstart [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI), [now a Microsoft partner](https://www.ft.com/content/cd6eb51a-3276-450f-87fd-97e8410db9eb). On top of this, AI labs have a history of splitting apart to form new labs. [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) was founded by OpenAI employees; [Udio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udio) was founded by Google DeepMind employees. Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO, has even mused about leaving and raising billions of dollars to start a new lab, reportedly on account of frustrations with corporate politics ([Victor, 2024](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-demis-hassabis-chafes-under-new-ai-push)).",

            "initial_reasoning": "To forecast how many new AI labs will become leading labs within 2 years of their founding before 2030, we start by considering historical trends in the AI research and development landscape. The rise of OpenAI, Anthropic, and newer entries like Mistral suggest an environment that supports the creation and success of new labs. In the last decade, the number of new AI labs achieving leading status was relatively small, as incumbents like Google DeepMind and OpenAI have dominated. However, the emergence of new players indicates potential for more disruption. Given this context and considering the technological, financial, and institutional realities of establishing top-tier AI labs, the initial base rates are distributed with the most weight on lower numbers of labs (reflecting historical difficulty and the dominance of existing players) but allowing for some possibility of higher numbers due to the rapid advancements and increasing investments in AI.",

Historically, we observe that major, rapidly successful AI labs tend to emerge when there are significant technological shifts or an influx of substantial funding and expertise. Given the current momentum in AI development and an increasing number of new entrants, a reasonable estimation for the base rate could be around 2-3 labs achieving 'leading' status within the next five years, when factoring in the heightened competition and market saturation.

In the AI field, major labs like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic have sustained leadership positions due to their headway in research and partnerships. Nevertheless, the rapid growth and investment in AI over recent years suggest an elevated probability of new entrants gaining prominence. Drawing on the frequency of similar transformations within the tech industry and considering the current momentum, I hypothesize: - '0 or 1': This outcome is plausible given the historical concentration of power among existing major players. - '2 or 3': New labs like xAI and Mistral demonstrate the potential for new entries to threaten the status quo in big tech. - '4 or 5': This remains a less likely outcome since major destabilizations are rare without fundamental technological shifts. - '6 or 7', '8 or 9', '10 or more': These scenarios demand even more rapid upheavals than seen historically.",

The Chinese government has been actively promoting the AI industry over the past decade, and the number of users of generative AI products in China has reached 249 million, accounting for 17.7% of the total population. The industry report points out that the talent gap in AI will reach 4 million by 2030. DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, has released a new AI model called DeepSeek R1, which has shocked the global AI industry. The company's founder, Liang Wenfeng, and his team have created two domestic AI products, which have shaken the global and US tech industry. DeepSeek has applied for a free app download on the Apple US App Store, ranking first in the free app download list in the US region, surpassing ChatGPT. AI talent is in short supply, and industry insiders believe that this is a golden age for AI talent. According to CCTV's financial report, the number of Chinese domestic video generation large models has shown an explosive growth trend since 2024. New job demands have emerged, such as AI content creators, AI director assistants, and AI script generation specialists. AI beauty engineer Cao Jun said, 'This position requires good aesthetic taste and aesthetic judgment.' 'Currently, I think this gap is still quite large, because people are not aware of the need for this position and the emergence of this job.' 'If it's self-media applications, AIGC talent demand is almost unlimited. Once you try AI, you'll find that it can realize your dreams that you've had for years. It's like adding a brush to a pen.' Beijing-based technology company product vice president Liao Qian said, 'AI beauty engineers, AI editors, they can produce AI big movies using our products.

Google's survey found that 49% of Australians used generative AI in the last year, up from 38% in 2023, but only 70% of employees feel prepared to make the most of AI at work. In contrast, 91% of C-suite leaders believe their employees are able to use the technology efficiently. Accenture's research also found that employees are concerned about inaccuracies, lack of resources, and integration struggles with AI. The country needs 312,000 additional tech workers by 2030 to meet demand, and Microsoft has committed to equipping one million people across Australia and New Zealand with essential AI skills by 2026. Matt Coates, technology lead for Accenture in Australia and New Zealand, said, 'Too many organisations view generative AI solely as a technological solution, rather than as a driving force to rethink talent strategies.' \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 07:34 PM\nSource:[techrepublic.com](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/ai-adoption-australia-google-accenture/)\n\n**China's AI Talent Gap Expected to Reach 4 Million by 2030**\nSince 2024, domestic video generation large models have experienced explosive growth.

Amodei believes that AI will have both positive and negative consequences. In the short term, he suggests using workload comparisons. 'Even if a machine does 90% of your work, the remaining 10% becomes super-loaded. You spend all your time doing these 10%, but you do 10 times more from those 10% that you used to do, and you do 10 times more because the other 90% is used [by AI]'. Amodei previously suggested that artificial superintelligence could become possible in 2026 or 2027. Other industry leaders, such as Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI, and Elon Musk, one of the co-founders of the company, believe that AI can surpass humans as early as 2025. Demis Hassabis, executive director of Google DeepMind, and Yann LeCun, chief scientific officer of Meta and Turing Award winner, are more conservative in their views, suggesting that artificial superintelligence may be created within the next decade.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 10:54 AM\nSource:[itc.ua](https://itc.ua/news/zamenyt-lyudej-pochty-vezde-ceo-anthropic-predvydyt-novye-modely-yskusstvennogo-yntellekta/)\n\n**Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year  --  Here's How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000**\nU.S. Rep.

However, 85 million jobs are at risk of being replaced. Experts like Javier Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, president of Digitalent Group, see AI as a 'revolution that will change humanity after the discovery of fire'. Others, like Mark Kavelaars, cofounder of Swanlaab Venture Factory, see it as a 'moment of great change' that reminds him of the first time he sat in front of a PC 40 years ago. Companies like Lixsa.ai are helping small and medium-sized businesses to give a qualitative leap and gain a competitive advantage by using AI to optimize and automate key customer service processes. According to Javier Gonz\u00e1lez B\u00e1ez, director of innovation at Acciona, 'small and medium-sized businesses have to do it now because it may be too late next year'. 'The AI will transform almost all areas within organizations, allowing them to increase productivity by solving complex problems quickly and simply, and simplifying processes that are currently complicated and time-consuming', says Mart\u00edn D\u00edaz Morquio, co-founder of Lixsa.ai. However, not everyone is optimistic, and Yolanda D\u00edaz Villarrubia, founder of Idea B3Hub s, believes that those who do not integrate AI into their culture and processes will be left behind. 'The change has to be transversal and permeate the entire organization, managing the use of AI in a smart way, knowing when to automate tasks or not', she says. 'We have to avoid the risk of creating biases in the design of algorithms, like Amazon's, which always recommended men over women for a job', warns Cristina Carrascosa, cofounder of ATH21. New business opportunities are emerging, such as ZeroError, a platform that uses AI to detect anomalies in data. According to Maria Jos\u00e9 Marti, CEO and founder of ZeroError, 'we couldn't have existed 10 years ago because the technology didn't exist'. 'Thanks to AI combined with expertise in data analysis, we can solve real problems in just a few weeks', she says.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 27, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[castellonplaza.com](https://castellonplaza.com/comoayudalaiaalosemprendedores)\n\n**AI to Eliminate 78 Million Jobs by 2030, Create 170 Million New Ones**\nAccording to a recent investigation, by 2030, nearly 80 million jobs will be lost due to artificial intelligence (AI).

Rather than fearing AI, we must adapt and develop skills that complement its strengths with our uniquely human skills. AI is designed to augment human abilities, but when we fail to upskill and align with its operations, it can easily outperform and replace us. To thrive in the age of AI, workers and business owners must focus on upskilling and reskilling, honing skills such as creativity, empathy, critical thinking, strategic planning, and innovation. Continuous learning and personal development are no longer optional but necessary for career longevity. Collaboration with AI rather than competition is the key to survival. By learning to work with AI tools, developing strong analytical skills, and focusing on human-centric skills, individuals can remain indispensable in their industries and create opportunities in the workforce. The future of work in the age of AI is not about job loss; it is about job transformation. By proactively developing skills that complement AI, workers can stay ahead in the workforce and drive innovation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[opinionnigeria.com](https://www.opinionnigeria.com/the-future-of-work-in-the-age-of-artificial-intelligence-by-phebe-ejinkeonye-christian/)\n\n**Bill Gates Recommends Book on AI, Predicts Massive Changes in Jobs**\nBill Gates believes that everyone should read his favorite book on artificial intelligence, which predicts that AI will change the shape of most jobs in almost every industry within the next five years, according to a report by CBS News. The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5104271)\n\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding.

Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/ia-criara-170-milhoes-de-novos-empregos-ate-ao-final-da-decada/)\n\n**Whoever Leads In AI Compute Will Lead The World**\nThe AI compute market is projected to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030, with the leader controlling the best data and compute platforms. The New Trump administration is preparing to take office with a bold vision to leverage technology and artificial intelligence to strengthen America's global competitiveness. China and the U.S. are the biggest contenders in the AI compute race, with China investing $6.12 billion in AI data centers and the U.S. investing $30 billion annually in data infrastructure. However, the rapid expansion of data centers has created an urgent need for utilities and the government to increase power generation capacity, with a focus on a perfect mix of renewable and conventional energy sources. Saudi Arabia is also becoming a force to be reckoned with in the AI infrastructure race, with a planned $100bn Project Transcendence AI hub. Companies such as Innatera are advocating for neuromorphic computing, which uses less energy than traditional practices. Whoever leads in AI compute will have the strongest voice in the future, and it's not just about being among the first, but about shaping the next revolution of technology.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 17, 2025 06:37 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2025/01/17/whoever-leads-in-ai-compute-will-lead-the-world/)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, Report Says**\nThe World Economic Forum (WEF) has recently released the Future of Jobs Report 2025, which extensively analyzes global trends in the labor market and predicts their impact on jobs, skills, and worker transformation strategies in 2025-2030. A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[speka.media](https://speka.media/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030. However, current job vacancies and specializations are expected to decrease by 22%. The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible. Notably, 86% of employers believe that AI will fundamentally change the labor market, particularly in finance and electronics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 05:15 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https://finance.rambler.ru/business/54044986-vef-iskusstvennyy-intellekt-sozdast-170-mln-novyh-rabochih-mest/)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs and Eliminate 92 Million by 2030**\nAccording to the World Economic Forum's report on the Future of Jobs 2025, artificial intelligence (AI) and data processing technologies will drive business model changes for nine out of ten employers in the next five years. This will lead to the extinction of certain jobs, such as cashiers or ticket clerks, while others will flourish. The report states that by 2030, the interaction between humans and machines will 'change dramatically', with 47% of tasks currently performed by humans and only 30% involving collaboration with machines, being practically balanced. The report recommends designing technologies that complement human work rather than replacing it, and establishing a collaborative relationship between humans and machines. The report also projects that the global labor market will experience a structural change equivalent to 22% of current employment, resulting in the creation of 170 million new jobs and the elimination of 92 million, with a net positive balance. The report highlights the need for active collaboration between governments, companies, and educational organizations to ensure that the benefits of this transformation are inclusive and equitable.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2025 12:09 PM\nSource:[EL PA\u00cdS](https://elpais.com/economia/2025-01-14/en-cinco-anos-se-crearan-170-millones-de-empleos-en-el-mundo-por-la-inteligencia-artificial.html)\n\n**AI to Create 78 Million New Jobs, But Also Eliminate 92 Million Existing Positions**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum report, the job market is expected to undergo significant changes in the next six years.

This represents a growth of over 7x since 2015, when only 6% of new unicorns were AI startups. These AI startups are also achieving unicorn status at a record pace, with a median of two years, compared to nine years for non-AI startups. The growth of AI startups can be attributed to their ability to operate with smaller and more agile teams. For example, World Labs, with 18 employees, and Skild AI, with 19 employees, both founded in 2023, have already been valued at over $1 billion. The analysis suggests that AI startups are able to automate certain functions and scale faster with fewer employees than non-AI startups. Additionally, the hype surrounding AI technology is attracting investors' attention earlier. Some of the smallest AI teams among the new unicorns include: World Labs (18 employees, founded in 2024, valued at $1 billion), Skild AI (19 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $1.5 billion), Sakana AI (34 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $1.5 billion), Cognition AI (49 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $2 billion), and Poolside (75 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $3 billion). These startups are focused on emerging areas of opportunity in AI, such as intelligent robotics and embedded AI, and AI agents and copilots for coding. However, the report also notes that unicorns are facing challenges in fundraising, with over a third of unicorns not receiving new investments since 2021. If these companies tried to raise money now, their valuation would likely be lower due to the current economic climate, which could cause their value to drop below $1 billion, making them no longer considered unicorns.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[consumidormoderno.com.br](https://consumidormoderno.com.br/44-dos-novos-unicornios-ia/)\n\n"
