    "question": "Before 2030, how many new AI labs will be leading labs within 2 years of their founding?",
    "description": "Since the release of [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT), an AI chatbot made by OpenAI and the [fastest-growing app in history](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/), new players have flocked to the AI scene\u2014for example, Elon Musk\u2019s [xAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XAI_(company)) and French upstart [Mistral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistral_AI), [now a Microsoft partner](https://www.ft.com/content/cd6eb51a-3276-450f-87fd-97e8410db9eb). On top of this, AI labs have a history of splitting apart to form new labs. [Anthropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic) was founded by OpenAI employees; [Udio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udio) was founded by Google DeepMind employees. Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO, has even mused about leaving and raising billions of dollars to start a new lab, reportedly on account of frustrations with corporate politics ([Victor, 2024](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-demis-hassabis-chafes-under-new-ai-push)).\n\nThis question asks about how many new, leading AI labs there are likely to be by the end of the decade. This is an interesting question for various groups of people. On the one hand, many are concerned that the big tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are the big players in AI, and that this might mean [even more centralization of power](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/22/ai-is-giving-big-tech-inordinate-power-tech-execs-say.html) absent new competition. On the other hand, people concerned about [AI safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety#Existential_safety) are concerned that a greater number of labs will mean intensified [race dynamics](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ai-race) and a greater chance that at least one leading lab cuts corners on safety, to catastrophic effect.",

The report highlights significant shifts in the employment market, with substantial job growth in certain careers, but also warns of job losses in shrinking industries and roles where artificial intelligence (AI) is replacing human workers. Euronews notes that some careers are on the chopping block, including those in the banking sector, where up to 200,000 jobs may be cut in the next three to five years. However, other sectors, such as those in healthcare and education, are expected to remain unaffected by automation, offering good prospects for the future. As AI advancements continue, companies like Meta are restructuring their workforces, and Salesforce has introduced AI agents to perform tasks. The report suggests that workers must pursue continuous learning and skill development to transition into jobs less likely to be affected by AI.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 02:20 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/02/03/best-jobs-for-growth-in-the-next-5-years-winners-and-losers/)\n\n**China's Ambitious Plan to Dominate AI by 2030**\nChina aims to become a global leader in AI by the end of the decade, and its plan is to rely solely on itself. The country has demonstrated its ability to overcome challenges in AI, as seen in the recent success of DeepSeek. Two major government initiatives are driving this development: the 'New Generation AI Development Plan' (2017) and the 'Made in China 2025' program (2015). These plans aim to reduce dependence on foreign technology and promote national innovation. China's AI industry has experienced significant growth, with an estimated value of $41.2 billion in 2024, a 12% increase from 2023. The government is investing heavily in AI, with a projected $138 billion investment over the next five years. China is also leading in patent registrations, with over 38,000 patents filed between 2014 and 2023, compared to 6,300 in the US. Chinese tech giants are integrating AI into their services, such as Xiaomi's Xiao AI and Oppo's AndesGPT. However, the country still faces challenges, including the US chip export ban, which has forced Chinese companies to seek alternatives. The government has instructed companies to purchase AI chips from Chinese manufacturers to reduce dependence on Western industries. The Chinese government exercises significant control over AI developments, requiring models to be approved by regulators and censors. Despite these challenges, China has made significant progress in AI, with models rivaling those of US companies like OpenAI and Google. The country has also adopted an open-source approach to AI development, sharing models with the community and encouraging collaboration. This approach is a departure from the closed and proprietary models favored by most US tech companies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 12:40 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/robotica-e-ia/china-quiere-convertirse-motor-mundial-ia-su-plan-depender-solo-ella)\n\n**AI to Revolutionize Global Economy, 350% Growth by 2030**\nAccording to AltIndex data, the Artificial Intelligence (AI) market is expected to grow by 350% by 2030, outpacing other tech sectors such as cloud computing and robotics.

The number of companies using generative AI technology for research and development has reached 15%, with 700 companies. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup, has released an AI model called 'R1', which has caused a stir in the market due to its ability to achieve similar performance to American products at a fraction of the cost. Experts say that 'China's AI rise has just begun'. The Chinese government has been actively promoting AI development, with a goal of becoming a world leader in AI by 2030. The government has also set up a number of initiatives to support AI research and development, including the 'AI+ Action Plan' and the 'Strategic Emerging Industries Development Plan'. China has also seen significant progress in AI patent applications, with 38,210 applications filed in 2023, accounting for 70% of the global total. The country's AI industry is expected to continue to grow rapidly, with many startups and companies already achieving significant success. However, some experts have raised concerns about the lack of innovation and creativity in China's AI industry, citing the country's reliance on government support and the need for more independent research and development.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2025 01:40 AM\nSource:[\u97e9\u56fd\u6700\u5927\u7684\u4f20\u5a92\u673a\u6784\u300a\u4e2d\u592e\u65e5\u62a5\u300b\u4e2d\u6587\u7f51](https://chinese.joins.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=118435)\n\n**5 Careers That Could Disappear in 2030 According to AI**\nAccording to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, 92 million jobs could be lost due to the rise of artificial intelligence, but 170 million new jobs could be created in various sectors. The report states that 25% of current jobs could be replaced by machines in the next decade. The following careers are at risk of disappearing in the next 5 years, according to AI: 1. Cashiers and customer service representatives: With the rise of automated cashiers and chatbots, many businesses are opting for technologies that reduce the need for human cashiers and customer service representatives. 2. Call center operators: Companies are adopting automated response systems and virtual assistants that operate 24/7, significantly reducing the demand for human operators in call centers. 3. Taxi and truck drivers: The implementation of autonomous vehicles, powered by AI, is growing rapidly. Companies like Tesla and Waymo are developing technologies that could replace human drivers in taxis, trucks, and public transportation. 4. Manufacturing workers: Industrial automation has made robots with AI perform repetitive tasks with greater precision and speed, reducing the need for human operators in factories. 5. Receptionists: More and more offices and hotels are using self-service kiosks and digital systems to register visitors, eliminating the need for traditional receptionists. While these changes may seem concerning, they also open the door to new job opportunities in fields like programming, robotics, and data management. Adaptability and acquiring technological skills, such as AI, will be key to staying competitive in the future job market.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 11:30 PM\nSource:[MVS Noticias](https://mvsnoticias.com/tendencias/ciencia-tecnologia/2025/2/2/estas-son-las-carreras-que-podrian-desaparecer-en-anos-segun-la-inteligencia-artificial-676782.html)\n\n**AI Redefines the Future of Work: Over 40% of Companies Plan to Reduce Staff by 2030**\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the world of work at a rapid pace. However, this technological transformation also has a significant impact on human employment, with millions of workers facing the possibility of being replaced by increasingly autonomous and sophisticated systems. According to the World Economic Forum's Future of Work 2025 report, 41% of employers plan to reduce their workforce in the coming years as AI takes on more responsibilities. This trend poses a challenging scenario for certain sectors, particularly those that rely on repetitive or administrative tasks, such as postal services, accounting, and administrative management. Nevertheless, automation could lead to the creation of new specialized roles in managing and supervising technology. The report states that 77% of large companies plan to train their employees in AI-related skills between 2025 and 2030, offering an opportunity for workers willing to adapt and acquire new knowledge to collaborate with technology rather than competing against it. As AI continues to evolve, companies seek not only efficiency and cost reduction but also a rapid adaptation to the new market dynamics. The key to navigating this new paradigm lies in finding a balance between technological implementation and human talent management.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2025 05:13 PM\nSource:[Vandal](https://vandal.elespanol.com/random/la-ia-redefine-el-futuro-laboral-mas-del-40-de-las-empresas-planean-recortes-de-personal-para-2030/31078.html)\n\n**3 Monster Stocks to Hold for the Next 10 Years**\nThe article suggests three 'monster stocks' to hold for the next 10 years: Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Roku, and Rocket Lab USA.

The global space-launch service industry is expected to grow at an annualized pace of more than 13% between now and 2034.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2025 10:45 AM\nSource:[fool.com](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/02/01/3-monster-stocks-to-hold-for-the-next-10-years/)\n\n**Microsoft's Regional Director Predicts Human-Robot Marriages by 2050**\nDr. Ahmed Bahaa El-Din, Microsoft's Regional Director, predicts that by 2050, there will be demands for the legalization of human-robot marriages, citing that the upcoming industrial revolution will be about humans coexisting with machines, not just using them. According to El-Din, the rapid technological progress will lead to a point where any program that helps a computer think or feel like humans is considered artificial intelligence, and we have already reached a point where programs can smell better than humans. El-Din notes that the field of machine learning has become massive, and we have reached the level of deep learning, and after that, generative intelligence. He emphasizes that these developments are imposing a new world on us, and there is a statistic that says 65% of those who started first grade in 2016 will work in jobs that we don't know about. El-Din also predicts that 40% of the workforce will be managed by robots within 15 years, and that the fifth industrial revolution will start between 2035 and 2040, focusing on autonomous systems. He adds that the quantum computer will help speed up technological progress and lead to this fifth industrial revolution, as it can solve a problem that would take 10,000 years in just 200 seconds.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 31, 2025 06:16 PM\nSource:[pressnew.net](https://www.pressnew.net/article/22191503)\n\n**OpenAI teases \u201cnew era\u201d of AI in US, deepens ties with government**\nOpenAI has announced a partnership with the US government, deepening its ties with the National Laboratories.

The book, 'The Next Wave: Technology and Power and the Greatest Challenge of the 21st Century', was written by Mustafa Suleyman, a pioneer in AI and the founder of the research lab DeepMind, which was sold to Google in 2014 and is now the executive director of Microsoft AI. Gates wrote on his blog last month: 'It is the book that I recommend more than any other book on AI - to heads of state, business leaders, and anyone else who asks - because it provides something rare: a clear vision of both the extraordinary opportunities and the real risks of the future.' In the book, Suleyman predicts that the rapid development of AI will change the way almost every industry works. He cites a 2023 study by McKinsey, which estimated that nearly half of all 'work activities' will become automated by 2030. Suleyman writes that the consequences of AI will be 'extremely destabilizing' for hundreds of millions of people who will need, at the very least, to be retrained and transition to new types of work. According to McKinsey, more than 400 million workers worldwide may need to transition to new jobs or roles. Suleyman says that AI will help workers become more efficient, as it already has in some cases, but only initially. He explains that 'these tools will only augment human intelligence temporarily. They will make us more intelligent and efficient for a while, and they will open up huge amounts of economic growth, but they will replace labor essentially.' How to prepare for the impact of AI on the workforce? Suleyman notes that from 'physical manufacturing' to 'cognitive work', the AI revolution will touch almost every industry. In the end, there will be 'few areas' where humans will be able to surpass machines. AI will quickly surpass human workers in office tasks such as administration, customer service, and content creation, according to Suleyman. He points out that the increase in inputs is likely to lead to a reality where employers will create millions of new jobs in response to economic growth. However, Suleyman notes that all this work will not go to humans: employers will choose 'very low-cost incentives' whenever possible. Some jobs are harder for AI to replicate. These include skilled trades such as plumbers and electricians, as well as office roles that rely heavily on social skills, critical thinking, and creativity. However, it is likely that everyone will need to upgrade their skills - and learn how to integrate this type of technology into their current jobs, as AI services spread across all industries over the coming years. Suleyman writes that many others will need to transition to entirely new jobs. This transformation is already underway. In 2023, a survey by EY found that 41% of American companies surveyed were implementing plans to train employees to work with AI products. According to a survey by Slack Workforce Lab in March 2024 of over 10,000 professionals, the key AI skills - such as rapid prototyping, machine learning, and data literacy - are a major factor in hiring for nearly 70% of employers. The massive challenge posed by AI to jobs. Some experts suggest that the economic benefits of AI will create enough new jobs to outweigh those lost. AI will create 78 million more jobs than it replaces by 2030, and the future of work will revolve around collaboration between humans and machines, according to the World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2025 report earlier this year. Even the optimists about AI agree that the massive changes in how people work are likely to lead to a period of dramatic transformation. In his book, Suleyman predicts that the new jobs enabled by AI developments will not come soon enough to save large parts of the global workforce. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said in a discussion with MIT President Sally Kornbluth in May 2024 that AI 'will kill a lot of current jobs, (and) there will be categories of jobs that will disappear completely.' 'Innovative treatments' and 'innovative solutions' and other benefits. Suleyman and Gates remain generally optimistic about the ability of AI to change people's lives for the better. Gates wrote last month that if workers and leaders prepare for massive changes, everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of 'innovative treatments for deadly diseases, innovative solutions to climate change, and high-quality education for all.' To achieve this better scenario, humans need to adopt AI by learning how to work with new technologies while implementing them in their daily lives and careers. This can start by exploring free online AI services such as 'Chat GPT' or other large language models that use AI. More advanced options include taking online courses to learn AI skills such as rapid prototyping. Suleyman emphasizes that 'this is a massive challenge that will determine, without exaggeration, the quality and nature of life in this century and the next.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 23, 2025 08:46 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5104271)\n\n**AI Boom: China Leads the World in AI Research, Japan Lags Behind**\nThe current state of AI is chaotic, with numerous scientific papers, patents, and startup funding.

The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and automation, along with the increasing adoption of digital tools and platforms, has had a significant impact on the global economy, changing the way companies operate and communicate with their customers. However, the rise of these technologies has also transformed the job market, forcing workers to requalify and adapt to new opportunities. Big data specialists form the backbone of innovation in AI across various sectors, from healthcare to finance and commerce. They play a crucial role in managing large datasets that enable fraud detection, predictive analysis, and recommendation systems. According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Report on the Future of Work 2025, big data specialists lead the list of fastest-growing jobs, with a projected increase of 110% between 2025 and 2030, far surpassing any other profession. Fintech engineers, who develop cutting-edge financial technologies such as blockchain and digital payment systems, come in second, with a projected increase of 86% over the next five years. Meanwhile, machine learning specialists have fallen to third place, with a growth expectation of 81% by 2030. Application developers and security managers complete the top five jobs, with projected increases of 58% and 57%, respectively. The WEF predicts that training to become a data storage specialist, autonomous and electric vehicle specialist, or UI/UX designer will also be a good option for those seeking a secure job in the near future. While some jobs are growing, others are shrinking. According to the WEF, postal service employees, bank tellers, and data entry assistants face a decline of 25-35%. Secretaries, administrative assistants, and cashiers are also facing significant declines as automation advances. The 2024 Annual Report on Work Trends revealed that 75% of employees used AI at work last year, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. Additionally, two out of three technology leaders were more likely to give an opportunity to someone with AI skills than an experienced candidate without those skills. According to the WEF's predictions, AI will create over 170 million new jobs by 2030, far more than any other technology. This number brings many opportunities for workers willing to learn and adapt.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 20, 2025 06:43 PM\nSource:[Sapo - Portugal Online!](https://jornaleconomico.sapo.pt/noticias/ia-criara-170-milhoes-de-novos-empregos-ate-ao-final-da-decada/)\n\n**Whoever Leads In AI Compute Will Lead The World**\nThe AI compute market is projected to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030, with the leader controlling the best data and compute platforms.

A significant part of the report is dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the world's workforce. According to the report, the most significant trends in the labor market in 2025-2030 are: technological advancements, economic turbulence, green energy, lack of security, and an aging population. The report is based on surveys of over 1,000 employers representing over 14 million workers in 22 industry clusters and 55 economies worldwide. The authors of the report also collaborated with platforms such as Coursera, LinkedIn, and Indeed to supplement the survey results with real data on employment trends. The report predicts that by 2030, there will be approximately 170 million new jobs created, with AI playing a key role. However, 92 million roles will be replaced, resulting in a net increase of 78 million jobs. Technological changes remain the main driver of changes, with the expansion of digital access creating and displacing more jobs than any other macro-trend. AI and information technologies can provide 11 million new jobs, despite the expected displacement of 9 million. Meanwhile, robotics and autonomous systems will become the largest reducer, reducing the number of jobs by 5 million. For example, since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, investment in AI has increased by almost eight times, accompanied by increased funding for server infrastructure and energy systems to support AI systems. Although information technologies are leaders in the implementation of AI, the real sector of the economy, including industries such as construction and manufacturing, lags behind. Generative AI, in particular, technologies based on natural language processing (NLP), most significantly change work processes in finance, healthcare, education, retail, and the IT sector. It is expected that by 2030, the share of tasks performed exclusively by humans will decrease from 47% to 33%, and the share of automated tasks will increase from 22% to 33%. The report notes a change in the paradigm of future human-machine work. Interaction between humans, machines, and algorithms changes work roles in various fields. It is expected that automation will lead to changes in the way people work, and the proportional share of tasks performed exclusively or primarily by humans will decrease as technologies become more universal.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 15, 2025 07:23 AM\nSource:[speka.media](https://speka.media/bilse-robocix-misc-ci-skorocennya-yak-stucnii-intelekt-vplivatime-na-zainyatist-9xrdl5)\n\n**AI to Create 170 Million New Jobs by 2030, WEF Study Finds**\nAccording to a World Economic Forum (WEF) study, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to create 170 million new job openings by 2030.

The study, conducted among 11,000 employers from 55 countries, found that despite the expected job loss, the net employment growth will be around 7%. This is due to approximately 8% of the workforce being redirected to new fields, requiring employees to adapt and retrain. In response to the challenges of AI implementation, 77% of employers expressed willingness to invest in employee upskilling. Additionally, over half of companies plan to restructure their business to integrate AI, and 65% intend to hire professionals with expertise in new technologies. Nevertheless, around 40% of companies may lay off employees if AI automation becomes possible.

This will lead to the extinction of certain jobs, such as cashiers or ticket clerks, while others will flourish. The report states that by 2030, the interaction between humans and machines will 'change dramatically', with 47% of tasks currently performed by humans and only 30% involving collaboration with machines, being practically balanced. The report recommends designing technologies that complement human work rather than replacing it, and establishing a collaborative relationship between humans and machines. The report also projects that the global labor market will experience a structural change equivalent to 22% of current employment, resulting in the creation of 170 million new jobs and the elimination of 92 million, with a net positive balance.

This represents a growth of over 7x since 2015, when only 6% of new unicorns were AI startups. These AI startups are also achieving unicorn status at a record pace, with a median of two years, compared to nine years for non-AI startups. The growth of AI startups can be attributed to their ability to operate with smaller and more agile teams. For example, World Labs, with 18 employees, and Skild AI, with 19 employees, both founded in 2023, have already been valued at over $1 billion. The analysis suggests that AI startups are able to automate certain functions and scale faster with fewer employees than non-AI startups. Additionally, the hype surrounding AI technology is attracting investors' attention earlier. Some of the smallest AI teams among the new unicorns include: World Labs (18 employees, founded in 2024, valued at $1 billion), Skild AI (19 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $1.5 billion), Sakana AI (34 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $1.5 billion), Cognition AI (49 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $2 billion), and Poolside (75 employees, founded in 2023, valued at $3 billion). These startups are focused on emerging areas of opportunity in AI, such as intelligent robotics and embedded AI, and AI agents and copilots for coding. However, the report also notes that unicorns are facing challenges in fundraising, with over a third of unicorns not receiving new investments since 2021. If these companies tried to raise money now, their valuation would likely be lower due to the current economic climate, which could cause their value to drop below $1 billion, making them no longer considered unicorns.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 18, 2024 12:00 AM\nSource:[consumidormoderno.com.br](https://consumidormoderno.com.br/44-dos-novos-unicornios-ia/)\n\n",

Historically, the emergence of leading AI labs has been driven by technological advancements, investment surges in AI fields, and the rapid scaling capabilities allowed by cloud computing and open AI frameworks. Looking at trends in the past decade, new AI labs that achieved prominence quickly were able to leverage cutting-edge research talent and successfully attract venture capital funding. For instance, notable AI labs like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic have shown that high-impact AI research can rapidly gain recognition and influence. Python frameworks, machine learning libraries, and AI-friendly hardware have reduced the time to market for new AI innovations. Based on these historical frequencies and the tech ecosystem trends, we presume that a non-linear distribution with a central tendency towards moderate numbers of newly leading labs is reasonable. Our initial expectation is: '0 or 1' and '10 or more' as less likely extremes, while central options represent more probable outcomes.",
