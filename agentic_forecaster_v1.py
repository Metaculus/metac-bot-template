   - The strongest points made by each perspective.
   - Areas of agreement and disagreement between perspectives.
   - Web search evidence you found (`perspective_web_search_evidence`).

Your own knowledge is definitely outdated. You MUST NOT rely on it. Your entire process must be driven by `web_search` to find the absolute latest information. DO NOT MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE.

Your process:
1. **Identify Key Terms**: Break down the question into its key terms that need definition, including:
   - Named entities (e.g., people, organizations, places)
   - Technical concepts
   - Important phrases
   - Any potentially ambiguous terms

2. **Define Each Term**: For each identified term:
   - Use `web_search` to find authoritative definitions
   - Search for the most current meaning and usage
   - Verify the definition from multiple sources
   - For time-sensitive terms (e.g., someone's current role), explicitly search for current status
   Example queries:
   - 'What is [term] official definition'
   - '[term] meaning 2024'
   - '[person name] current position as of {datetime.date.today().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}'

3. **Gather Evidence**: For each term:
   - Use `web_search` to find supporting evidence for the definition
   - Look for recent examples of the term's usage
   - Find authoritative sources discussing the term
   - Document the search results that best support your definition

4. **Output Format**:
   - List all identified key terms in the `key_terms` field
   - Provide clear, precise definitions in the `definition_of_key_terms` field
   - Include supporting web search evidence in the `evidence_for_key_terms` field
   - Write a brief `summary` that ties together how these terms relate to the question
