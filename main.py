    """
    This is the template bot for Spring 2026 Metaculus AI Tournament.
    This is a copy of what is used by Metaculus to run the Metac Bots in our benchmark, provided as a template for new bot makers.
    This template is given as-is, and is use-at-your-own-risk.
    We have covered most test cases in forecasting-tools it may be worth double checking key components locally.
    So far our track record has been 1 mentionable bug per season (affecting forecasts for 1-2% of total questions)

    Main changes since Fall:
    - Additional prompting has been added to numeric questions to emphasize putting pecentile values in the correct order.
    - Support for conditional and date questions has been added
    - Note: Spring AIB will not use date/conditional questions, so these are only for forecasting on the main site as you wish.

    The main entry point of this bot is `bot.forecast_on_tournament(tournament_id)` in the parent class.
    See the script at the bottom of the file for more details on how to run the bot.
    Ignoring the finer details, the general flow is:
    - Load questions from Metaculus
    - For each question
        - Execute run_research a number of times equal to research_reports_per_question
        - Execute respective run_forecast function `predictions_per_research_report * research_reports_per_question` times
        - Aggregate the predictions
        - Submit prediction (if publish_reports_to_metaculus is True)
    - Return a list of ForecastReport objects

    Alternatively, you can use the MetaculusClient to make a custom filter of questions to forecast on
    and forecast them with `bot.forecast_questions(questions)`

    Only the research and forecast functions need to be implemented in ForecastBot subclasses,
    though you may want to override other ForecastBot functions.
    In this example, you can change the prompts to be whatever you want since,
    structure_output uses an LLM to intelligently reformat the output into the needed structure.

    By default (i.e. 'tournament' mode), when you run this script, it will forecast on any open questions in the
    primary bot tournament and MiniBench. If you want to forecast on only one or the other, you can remove one
    of them from the 'tournament' mode code at the bottom of the file.

    You can experiment with what models work best with your bot by using the `llms` parameter when initializing the bot.
    You can initialize the bot with any number of models. For example,
    ```python
    my_bot = MyBot(
        ...
        llms={  # choose your model names or GeneralLlm llms here, otherwise defaults will be chosen for you
            "default": GeneralLlm(
                model="openrouter/openai/gpt-4o", # "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514", etc (see docs for litellm)
                temperature=0.3,
                timeout=40,
                allowed_tries=2,
            ),
            "summarizer": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
            "researcher": "asknews/news-summaries",
            "parser": "openai/gpt-4o-mini",
        },
    )
    ```

    Then you can access the model in custom functions like this:
    ```python
    research_strategy = self.get_llm("researcher", "model_name"
    if research_strategy == "asknews/news-summaries":
        ...
    # OR
    summarizer = await self.get_llm("summarizer", "llm").invoke(prompt)
    # OR
    reasoning = await self.get_llm("default", "llm").invoke(prompt)
    ```

    If you end up having trouble with rate limits and want to try a more sophisticated rate limiter try:
    ```python
    from forecasting_tools import RefreshingBucketRateLimiter
    rate_limiter = RefreshingBucketRateLimiter(
        capacity=2,
        refresh_rate=1,
    ) # Allows 1 request per second on average with a burst of 2 requests initially. Set this as a class variable
    await self.rate_limiter.wait_till_able_to_acquire_resources(1) # 1 because it's consuming 1 request (use more if you are adding a token limit)
    ```
    Additionally OpenRouter has large rate limits immediately on account creation
