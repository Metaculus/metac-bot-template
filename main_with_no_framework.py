"""
This file provides a simple forecasting bot built from the ground up.
We provide this for people who want to dissect
it to build their own bot without using forecasting-tools.

This template assumes you are using a OpenAI model and have an OpenAI API key
You will also need a Metaculus API key, for posting questions to Metaculus
and a Perplexity or AskNews API key for online research

This is not a representative of the tempalte bots used by Metaculus, as there are some
differences in implementation. The actual template bot (e.g. like main.py) has the following differences:
- An LLM now parses the final forecast output (rather than programmatic parsing)
- Support for nominal bounds was added (i.e. when there are discrete questions and normal upper/lower bounds are not as intuitive)
- Upper/Lower bounds are mentioned as suggestions (not ignored) when the bounds are open
- Group questions are supported
- The research prompt mentions resolution criteria and fine print explicitly

We realize the below code could probably be cleaned up a bit in a few places
Though we are assuming most people will dissect it enough to make this not matter much

Note that this is code is given as-is and though we have have done basic testing
with this file it may be worth double checking key components locally.

You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.

Your interview question is:
{title}

The options are: {options}


Background:
{background}

{resolution_criteria}

{fine_print}


Your research assistant says:
{summary_report}

Today is {today}.

Before answering you write:
(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.
(c) A description of an scenario that results in an unexpected outcome.

You write your rationale remembering that (1) good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time, and (2) good forecasters leave some moderate probability on most options to account for unexpected outcomes.

The last thing you write is your final probabilities for the N options in this order {options} as:
Option_A: Probability_A
Option_B: Probability_B
...
Option_N: Probability_N
